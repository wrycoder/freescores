We half-delude ourselves; maybe this year will be different, maybe winter won''t come.  But November has finally set in, even here in  Ohio''s southernmost (and most Southern) city.\r\n\r\nMy Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and piano is subtitled "Shadows of November."  The subtitle sounds better in French: "Les Ombres de Novembre." That''s how it appears on the score''s cover page because I wrote it for a superb French clarinetist, my good friend Lucien Aubert, and the trio in which he played, who called themselves "les Gavottes."\r\n\r\nYou''re invited to listen to the final movement, 3.5 minutes long, as recorded by les Gavottes. Gosh, they''re good!  You''re going to love this, I predict.\r\n\r\nIt might not sound November-ish, so let me explain.  There are three movements in this work.  The first movement is ambiguous, like a November fog.  The second movement is deeply mournful, perhaps the saddest music I''ve written.  Then comes the third movement, the one I want to share with you this evening.\r\n\r\nTo me, this music expresses the bracing, exuberant, almost vulgar zest of November.  We hunker down, snuggle into a cozy chair, stretch our legs in front of the fire, drink red wine, tell funny stories and laugh with our friends even as, outside, the freezing rain is slicing through the evening air.  Half way through this movement the music becomes so spirited that it almost sounds like a high school band determinedly performing a half-time show in a heavy, pebble-y hail of sleet.  \r\n\r\nThis music is jovial yet biting, as if to say:  the great god Pan never dies, the energy of life is forever reaffirmed.  Which reminds me of a poem I wrote.\r\n\r\nI''ve written five books, but very little poetry.  A few years ago, however, circumstances forced me to devise some words for a November-ish tune of mine which I wanted to include in a choral work.  Choristers need words to sing, so I was forced to become, for once, a lyricist as well as a composer.  I set myself to the task, bore down, wouldn''t quit until I''d come up with something suitable.  \r\n\r\nI think the words I came up with express the same ideas about November that are expressed musically in this trio.  \r\n\r\nHere''s the poem, such as it is.\r\n\r\nLife''s Oldest Song\r\n\r\nGone now are the autumn leaves, \r\nto cold earth they have fled, \r\nand all of the trees seem dreary now \r\nthat once were yellow and red. \r\n\r\nOver us now cold winds are blowing, \r\nmourning the passing of fall, \r\nreminding us of the truth immutable: \r\ndeath comes to us all. \r\n\r\nSuch words we cannot gainsay. \r\nThis truth to all is known, \r\nand we feel it most keenly this time of year, \r\nwhen autumn colors have flown.  \r\n\r\nYet look again at field and forest, \r\nstudy the stubble and twig: \r\na hint of color foretells a blossom \r\nwill bloom forth from each sprig. \r\n\r\nSo friends, let us gather now \r\nand sing Life''s Oldest Song, \r\nreminding ourselves to love that well \r\nwhich we must leave ere long, \r\n\r\nConsoling one another''s sorrows, \r\nraising our voices high, \r\nliving life more fully though knowing \r\nthat, like leaves, we must fly.\r\n\r\nMy Trio #3, "Shadows of November," was recorded by Les Gavottes.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nNovember, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne of my oldest friends is Dick Ferrell, whom I have known for more than half a century.  Back in 1961, when I joined Boy Scout Troop 152 of Lexington, Ohio, I was assigned to the Red Fox Patrol.  Dick was my Patrol Leader.  Through our teens we were together on many, many Scouting adventures — hiking, camping in all weathers, competing in woodcraft skills, cooking over campfires.  We both became Eagle Scouts at the same Court of Honor in 1966.  Later, in our thirties, we served Scouting as adult volunteers, leading High Adventure canoe trips to Algonquin Provincial Park where we saw moose, bears, minks, loons and heard wolves howl at the moon, a sound I will always remember.\r\n\r\nNow we’re old guys.  It’s been a long time since either of us slept in a tent.  “The ground has gotten so much harder than it used to be,” says Dick.  “It must have something to do with global warming.”  \r\n\r\nTroop 152 is still going strong and has turned out nearly a hundred Eagle Scouts.  Dick still lives near Lexington and keeps me posted.\r\n\r\nSometimes he sends me poems he’s written.  Here’s one about the peculiar, stark beauty of this time of year, something Dick and I have observed, firsthand, together, on many a camping trip.\r\n\r\nNovember Has A Beauty All Its Own\r\n\r\nHe views the naked cornfield\r\nRinged with gray and brown and black,\r\nAnd he knows that fall has fallen\r\nAnd there is no turning back.\r\n\r\nThere''s a twinkling of twilight\r\nAs he hurries down the path\r\nTo the warm and candled window\r\nOf his rustic woodsy shack.\r\n\r\nHe smells decay and oldness\r\nMixed with pine and apple scent,\r\nAnd he sees the snow clouds gather\r\nRank on rank, in their ascent.\r\n\r\nHe feels the cold wind quicken,\r\nAnd he hears the forest moan\r\nAs he''s reminded: November has\r\nA beauty all its own.\r\n\r\nIn my Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Shadows of November,” I tried to express it musically.\r\n\r\nTo hear the French trio, “les Gavottes,” play the first movement from "Shadows of November,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 8, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),55);

You may not think of it this way, but you are gifting me by allowing me to share these musical messages with you.  When artists know their work is engaging an audience, even a small one, It means so much that it feels like a gift. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis time I want to share a short original Christmas carol (2:48; the fourth link on the list above).\r\n\r\nNon-Christian friends and fans, please pardon the Christmas reference.  It''s not my intention to proselytize.  What I want to share is the sweetness of the tune, for its own sake, the Christian content aside.\r\n\r\nThe carol is sung by Jose Rubio, a wonderful baritone who used to live in the apartment right above ours, here on Milton Street in Cincinnati.  It was a joy to hear him vocalizing upstairs!  \r\n\r\nIn this recording, Jose sings the carol with such warmth and feeling that I fancy I can hear him smiling as he sings.  And I love the way rolls his ''r''s.\r\n\r\nAs befits a carol, the tune is simple and doesn''t vary through the four verses.  Instead, it’s the accompaniment that differs for each verse:  the piano is tone-painting the ideas expressed in the lyrics.  \r\n\r\nTo see how this is done, follow the words as you listen:\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morn the birds all wake and fly, cu-roo, \r\nto seek the Child with wand''ring cry, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nthe thrush, the swallow, the bluebird small, \r\nthey gather round His cradle stall, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo. \r\n\r\nThe crow and jay their raucous cries do still, cu-roo, \r\nto join the dove and whippoorwill, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nthe larks in exultation sing \r\nto glorify their newborn King, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo.     	       \r\n\r\nOn silent wings the wise-eye''d owls descend, cu-roo, \r\nthe falcon and the sweet brown wren, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nwith quail and pheasant by Mary''s side \r\nthe folk of field and glen abide, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo. \r\n\r\nThe feather''d choir its cheerful an-thems raise, cu-roo, \r\nto warm the frosty dawn with praise cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nand with the angel host above, \r\nthey greet the tiny Bird of Love, cu-roo, cu-roo.\r\n\r\nThe tune for this carol came to me in a dream in the Fall of 1978.  This has happened only three or four times.  I woke up and wrote it down, quickly!  I was afraid I''d forget it.  I always thought the tune sounded like a Christmas carol; later I added appropriate words.\r\n\r\nIn scoring the tune, I had the idea of including, in the piano part, quotations of one of the world’s most famous melodies.  Several times and especially at the end, you''ll hear the piano accompaniment quoting the opening of J.S.

My grandparents dearly loved the place and sometimes took my brother and me there for weekend stays back in the 1950’s.  I remember sleeping in the huge, carved, Victorian bed in the room that honors Charles Dickens, one of the inn’s many famous guests.\r\n\r\nUnchanged today, the Golden Lamb is a place where I can still feel the presence of my beloved grandparents.  Our own little family dines there, once a year, on Jo’s birthday.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1970’s we stayed in the inn with a group of friends we’d brought down from north central Ohio (where we lived until 1994) to attend the Boar’s Head Festival at Cincinnati’s Christ Church Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne of our party, impressed with the inn’s Christmas decorations, said, “There ought to be a Carol of the Golden Lamb.”   A few weeks later she sent me a sweet little poem she’d written.  Here it is:\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Carol of the Golden Lamb \r\n	 by K. A. (she likes to keep a low profile, unlike a certain hambone composer you know)\r\n\r\nThe frost lay light upon the slopes, \r\nThe stars were crystal thorns, \r\nWhen from the soul of earth''s weak hopes \r\nThe Shepherd Child was born.\r\n\r\nThen came all creatures great and small \r\nTo celebrate the new-born King; \r\nWith muzzled fang and sheathed claw \r\nTheir homage wild to bring. \r\n\r\nBut one small lamb, the only one \r\nOf winged and creeping folk, \r\nNew-born as well, had missed the Son \r\nWhom men of old forespoke. \r\n\r\nWell-guarded by her shepherd''s crook \r\nThe lamb grew ever strong. \r\nYet longing sunny days o''er-took \r\nAnd hushed the lambkin''s song. \r\n\r\nOne hazy dawn she slipped away \r\nTo roam the dusty streets. \r\nShe found the tiny Prince that day \r\nAnd kept her vigil sweet. \r\n\r\nShe watched Him from the open door; \r\nShe dared not enter there\r\nFor fear her hooves upon the floor \r\nWould wake the Infant fair. \r\n\r\nThe Babe awoke and crowed with glee \r\nTo see the curly lamb. \r\nHe crooned in child-like hymnody, \r\nHe waved His tiny hands. \r\n\r\nAnd as she knelt beside His cot, \r\nThe golden Day-spring sun\r\nGlowed soft and shining on her coat — \r\nOf golden ringlets spun. \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nI set this poem to music, first as a choral piece, later as a baritone solo.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Jose Rubio smilingly singing "Carol of The Golden Lamb” (I fancy I can hear his smile, especially in the final line when he rolls the “R” in “ringlets") with collaborative pianist Avedis Manoogian, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 27, 2015\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),67);

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(5,replace(replace('Did you ever listen to a painting?  I have.  For hours at a time.  \r\n\r\nFor eight and a half years, I worked two or three days a week as a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, keeping watch over fabulous treasures displayed in large, echoing galleries.  When there were no visitors, I sometimes amused myself by trying to imagine what a painting would sound like if its subject matter were to be conveyed musically.\r\n\r\nThat little mental puzzle resulted in my two three-movement "Impressionist Suites" for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, each movement conveying the imagery and brushwork of a major French Impressionist painter.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Art Museum has only one painting by Monet, but it''s a doozie.  He renders the sombre cliffs of his native Normandy in tones of deep, dark rust and sets them in a tossing, vibrant ocean of sapphire, indigo, emerald and mint, dashed with strokes of salmon, magenta and lavender, arched by clouds like sherbet in a pink-orange sky.\r\n\r\nHow can a composer catch that in music?\r\n\r\nBy consulting his memory.  Our understanding of music is shaped by our memories of all the music we have heard.  When I ran a search through my memory for nautical-sounding music, my recollections were awash with half-remembered sea chanteys, fragments from "HMS Pinafore," "La Mer" and the stirring scores of many a swashbuckling pirate movie.   \r\n\r\nI thought of the ''colors'' of those three piquant instruments:  oboe, clarinet and bassoon.  I put those three instruments to work, playing a canon.  You''ll hear it right off in the low bassoon, then an octave higher in the clarinet, then yet another octave higher in the oboe ... and we''re away! like a ship with sails bellying into the wind! I Into the tossing, dazzling, salt-tanged seascape Monet evoked so memorably.\r\n\r\nI wrote my two Impressionist Suites in 2000 for my friend Lucien Aubert, clarinetist in Le trio d’anches Ozi.  Since these are Frenchmen playing for French audiences, I thought a suite about French Impressionist painters might please all concerned.  And it has.  This Monet movement will please you, too, hopefully. It''s played -- beautifully! -- by Mark Ostoich, Ron Aufmann and Mark Ortwein.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nJanuary 12, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWill you kindly permit me a longer-than-usual message?  \r\n\r\nHave I told you that I’m teaching French?\r\n\r\nIn the 2012-2013 school year I visited, twice, a remarkable K-12 Cincinnati school called “Leaves of Learning," a resource center where home-schooled students come for enrichment — for one or two classes or more, one, two, three or four days a week.  I was very impressed with the joyful, easy, accepting tone of the school and the students’ genuine enthusiasm for learning.  \r\n\r\nYou may know that, in addition to being a composer, I also write and publish books for young people about Ohio history, animals and folklore.  As a result, over the past thirty years, I’ve spent a day or two in more than 2,000 Ohio schools as a Visiting Author.  I became very accustomed to working with young people and have long felt very much at ease in visiting schools, albeit only as a ''One Day Wonder.’   \r\n\r\nToo, in my twenties and thirties, I had been a Scoutmaster.   I’ve always felt happy and at ease with young people.  I like them and they like me.  I had plenty of experience showing kids how to do things — in Scouts and in the schools I’d visited — but I was never a regular teacher, never committed myself to regularly recurring instruction sessions with a particular band of young souls.\r\n\r\nAfter my second day visiting Leaves of Learning, my host, a fine teacher named Terri Burch, said, “You should be teaching here!”  \r\n\r\nI baulked, scoffed.  “I’m not certified.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to be certified to teach here.  Talk to the principal, offer a course or two and if there are enough enrollees, you’ll teach.”\r\n\r\nWell, we set it up for me to start in September of 2014.  I would teach only on Wednesdays.  Two classes:  Music Theory and The Art of Storytelling.  I figured I’d give it a try, one day a week, for one school year.\r\n\r\nI told the principal that I would also be willing to substitute for the teachers of some other subjects as well … Language Arts, History, French.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the French teacher was unwell and I was soon ‘subbing’ for her quite often.  It was a little daunting at first.  My French is strong but it was rusty.  In college, I studied French intensively and did well.  But that was 45 years earlier.  I’ve visited France many times since, often staying in the homes of friends who spoke only French.  I''ve benefited greatly from their patient, humorous corrections of my gusty, improvised, somewhat surreal French.  But could I teach French?  Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you know how best to teach it!\r\n\r\nStill, as a sub, I only needed to stay a little ahead of the students in order to lead the class.\r\n\r\nI found that I loved subbing in French, imparting the mnemonic devices that have worked for me, challenging the students to create new ones, sharing stories of my adventures and blunders as an American joyfully floundering about in French. Plus stories of French history, culture and cuisine, garnered from my reading and experiences.  I am ardent about France, the land of my father’s ancestors.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the French teacher became increasingly unwell and in January of 2015 her bad health finally forced her to retire.  The principal invited me to take over the French program.  I gulped, but accepted the challenge.  Being halfway through a school year would present a particular challenge but I figured I’d survive until May and then we’d see.\r\n\r\nTeaching French the way I thought I could best teach it, free from the constraints of the lesson plans that are necessarily imposed on a substitute teacher, turned out to be a slice of Heaven.  I’ve loved every minute of it.   The school encourages creativity in both faculty and students and we make the most of it!  The students are great souls and we love to joke and ponder together as we explore the intricacies and delicacies of this beautiful, expressive, eccentric language.\r\n\r\nIn my Scout troop we had a saying:  “If it isn''t fun, it isn''t Scouting.”  If something we were doing wasn’t fun, we knew we were doing it wrong.  I apply that same approach in my classes with the happy result that we laugh together, frequently, often loudly.  \r\n\r\nWhen the school year ended and summer began, I found that I missed teaching very much.  I signed on for another year and my enthusiasm for teaching French (and Music Theory and Storytelling, which I have continued to teach) is unabated.\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect to continue teaching at Leaves of Learning for several years, into my seventies.  I tell the students, “I’m the school''s Oldest Living Teacher.”  They laugh.  \r\n\r\n“I’m the Gandalf of this school,” I tell them, “and you guys are the Hobbits!”  They laugh, but in a way, it’s true.  I’ve got the white beard.  I''m jolly but a little mysterious.  I’m very interested in them.  I’ve been “out there,” doing various things in the wide world for a long time -- France, most often -- while they''ve been growing up in the Shire.  \r\n\r\nMost of my trips to France have resulted from my music, one way or another.  I’ve been there for rehearsals, performances, recordings.  I’ve written many works for my French musician friends.  \r\n\r\nMy two “Impressionist Suites” for reed trio, for example.  Each movement attempts to evoke the spirit and character of a major French Impressionist painter.\r\n\r\nToday I’d like to share with you the final movement of the first of the suites.  It’s entitled, “Manet:  Spanish subjects.”  \r\n\r\nFrench people are fascinated by Spain; so far as I can tell, the French seem to consider the Spanish to be more spontaneous than themselves, in closer touch with the earth, with basic passions.  To the French, Spaniards seem to be more alive, more authentic, their approach to Life seeming more vivid, colorful and spicy than than theirs. Just think about “Carmen” or the Spanish subjects in the paintings of Manet.  By contrast, the French seem to view themselves as overly cultivated, too cerebral, too self-conscious, more than a little jaded.\r\n\r\nOf course, to an American like me, an outsider, these attitudes seem almost laughable, laden with stereotypes.  But delicious to discover.\r\n\r\nI hope my delight comes across in this music.  Note that it ends with all three musicians shouting, “Ole!"\r\n\r\nTo hear it played -- beautifully! -- by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 13, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),36);

I thought about the students who would sing it.  They study philosophy and classics; surely they''d like to sing something sublime, ancient, Greek.

The first movement, The Philosopher, sets to music a prose account of the old grump’s most celebrated moment, when he snubs Alexander the Great.

Choirs learn them quickly and easily.  Singing a round, a choir can sound terrific after only a few minutes of rehearsal.

My father, Colonel Richard Sowash, US Army Reserves, was a decorated hero of WWII.  My Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," written in 2000, is dedicated to his memory.  \r\n\r\nMy Scoutmaster, Frank Culp, was a hero to me and to many other young men who came through Troop 152 in Lexington, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nMy grandfather, John Hoff, whose influence was the most important in my life, about whom I wrote lovingly in my otherwise comical autobiography, The Boy Who Would Be Famous, entertained and inspired me, as a boy, with splendid stories of heroes from American history.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago I wrote a book for older elementary school children entitled, "Heroes of Ohio:  23 True Tales of Courage and Character," dedicated to that same grandfather.   For that book, my definition of a hero was:  someone who volunteers to do something challenging to help other people.  Simple!\r\n\r\nExpressing heroism musically is not so simple.  \r\n\r\nComposers have expressed heroism:  Beethoven''s Eroica Symphony, Wagner''s Gotterdammerung, Strauss'' Ein Heldenleben.\r\n\r\nBut they lived long ago and far away and their heroic music, great as it may be, feels remote, perhaps too lofty, as an expression of heroism in the "here and now" of our own time.\r\n\r\nToo, those are orchestral works.  When I set out to express heroism, I was writing for just three instruments:  violin, cello and piano.  Quite a different thing!  No brass, no timpani, no string and wind sections sawing and tooting, triple forte.\r\n\r\nMost of the heroic music that genuinely moves me reached my ears via film scores for great Hollywood westerns like The Magnificent Seven, How The West Was Won, The Big Country. Also the TV westerns I grew up watching:  Wagon Train, Bonanza.  To me, that is what the music of heroism sounds like.\r\n\r\nYet not exactly, not entirely.  After all, I am not a composer writing scores for Hollywood westerns.  My peculiar career has been as far removed from Hollywood as it has been from Academe or the New York avant garde.  My challenge was to find a way to incorporate the galloping excitement, the expansive textures and the sense of adventure found in the best western film scores into a work of serious, contemporary chamber music.\r\n\r\nThe result is this Presto, the final movement from my Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," in which a feeling of heroism is intended to prevail over the darker, troubled music of the earlier movements.\r\n\r\nDoes this final movement sound "too Hollywood?"  I don''t think so.  You''d never hear music like this in a western film score.  Does it genuinely express heroism, in a way that transcends the Hollywood influences?  See what you think.\r\n\r\nThe Presto from my Eroica trio is beautifully performed by violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nFeb. 23, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),37);

I wrote a half-hour piece called North Country Suite which they premiered in April of 2012.  \r\n\r\nSince the Mississippi originates in northern Minnesota I decided to portray that great, vast, storied river in the suite''s third movement, entitled "Father of Waters" -- that''s what the word "Mississippi" once meant in a Native American language. \r\n\r\nThe movement begins almost inaudibly;  you won''t hear much in the first few seconds.\r\n\r\nThen come tentative, trickling fragments of tunes, an evocation of the bubbling of springs and the coalescing of little streams and creeks, already with a few jazzy "Blue" notes.  These come together in a broad, rolling theme with a distinctively American, Western feel and then, just when the movement seems to end (about three and a half minutes through), comes a surprise:  the music goes Dixieland! ... because, of course, the Mississippi culminates in "N''awlins!"  \r\n\r\nThe Dixieland music is familiar-sounding because I deliberately wrote it in a very familiar style -- but the tune is original, I assure you -- that''s my tune, "Beignets and Gelato."\r\n\r\nI even included a banjo part, hoping the orchestra could locate a banjo player.   Sure enough, at the premiere, the concert mistress'' banjo-playing father was featured, his first performance before a crowd, and looking very trim and handsome, in his tuxedo!\r\n\r\nJosh Aerie conducts the Heartland Symphony Orchestra''s  in the live, premiere performance of the "Father of Waters" movement from my North Country Suite.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nMarch 2, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAmerican place-names!  Now there’s a subject.  A careful examination of the map of Ohio — my life-long stomping ground — reveals crossroads, hamlets and villages with peculiar names.  Glandorf, Peebles, Burgoon, Overpeck, Deunquat, Pancoastburg, Tipp City, Mingo Junction, Mogadore, Fitchville, Chuckery.\r\n\r\nSome cue laughter:  Coolville, Reminderville, Outville, Celeryville, Getaway, Nellie, Big Bottom, Round Bottom, Fly, Flushing and -- best of all! -- Knockemstiff.  \r\n\r\nKnowing that such names are spread across the Buckeye State, the thoughtful Ohioan daresn''t disdain the perplexing place-names found in other states.  We must keep a straight face when our consciousness is penetrated by the likes of Gnawbone, IN, Wahoo, NE, Dimebox, TX, Rabbit Hash, KY or Podunk, CT.\r\n\r\nSome are downright oxymoronic.  Remembering Brilliant, OH, we Buckeyes must needs soft-pedal our natural astonishment when we come upon Liberal, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThere are stories behind these monikers.  In 1872, a good-hearted fellow by the name of S. S. Rogers built the first house in what would become Liberal, KS.  Rogers became famous in the region for dispensing water to weary travelers.  The commodity was precious but the generous Mr. Rogers liberally ladled the stuff of life to the longing lips of thirsty pioneers.  Expressing their thanks, grateful recipients would say, “That’s mighty liberal of you, Mr. Rogers.”  \r\n\r\nNinety-Five years before public television, Liberality was the salient feature in this particular Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThink of it!  There was a time when the word “liberal” had positive connotations.  Then, along came Eugene V. Debs, William Jennings Bryan, Dorothy Day, T.R., F.D.R., William O. Douglas, M.L. King, George McGovern, Bernie Sanders, et al.  For better or worse, they changed the connotation of the word.  Today, very few public figures dare to embrace the adjective.  Many a Conservative has gotten elected chiefly by pointing at an opponent and yelling, “Liberal!  Liberal!  Liberal!"   Especially in places like Kansas.  A recent book title rightly raised the question, “What’s the Matter with Kansas?"\r\n\r\nFor me, genuine astonishment lingers in connection with Liberal, but not because of the improbability of coming upon such a place-name in a state determinedly red as Kansas. Twenty-five years ago, having landed a gig in Liberal, I flew into Wichita, rented a car and undertook the five-hour, west-bound drive on a highway as unwaveringly straight as a Kansas politician.  \r\n\r\nParts of Ohio may seem flat.  Tain’t so.  You don’t know flatness until you drive across Kansas.  The flatness of Kansas puts the lie to all other flatnesses.  Kansas is as flat as the Earth is round.  Flat, but not without color.  The sky is a depthless blue, the endless corn is Kelly green, broken only when white grain elevators become visible, a distant fleck at first, fully five miles away, seeming to grow as approached, finally towering ten stories high.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I noticed a strange, dark smudge, just above the horizon, far, far ahead.  Like the grain elevators, it seemed to rise, slowly, as I drew nearer but it also spread, slowly, to the south and north of my ‘Westward, ho!'' highway.  \r\n\r\nInexplicably, it rippled in gentle waves, rising and falling like a long, limpid, silken scarf, unimaginably vast, undulating unnaturally in a weirdly lugubrious wind.  I could form no theory to explain what I was seeing.  Was it some bizarre phenomenon of the weather?  A meteorological secret, unique to south-central Kansas?  Could clouds execute such a vast, slow-motion dance-step?  Was I watching the birth-throes of a tornado?\r\n\r\nNo.  It was birds.  Millions upon millions of birds, migrating.  The largest throng of birds I have ever seen or will ever see, winding across the sky in silent majesty.  Silent from a distance, that is.  At length, when I was underneath them, their cries were maddeningly raucous.  The extraordinary sound, which I will never hear again, climaxed as I passed through, then faded as I passed beyond the shifting shadows cast by a quarter billion birds.  \r\n\r\nSilent once more, the undulation came into sight in my rear view mirror, falling further and further behind until becoming, again, only a strange, dark smudge ... receding, fading, shriveling, diminishing at last to the merest wisp on the horizon.  Perhaps an hour after I had first sighted it, the spectacle fell from my sight.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing.  An immense wonder, unfolding with neither prompt nor direction from human beings, simply happening, once again, as it has for thousands and thousands of years, out there in the middle of the continent, a gigantic, living, non-human event taking place, all on its own, high above the prairie.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I ever saw that could compare with it was the Northern Lights.  Like that migrating column of birds, it is something I’ve seen only once.  When I was about seven years old, my parents awakened me one midnight and carried their little, sleepy boy, wrapped in a blanket, outside, to see the Northern Lights.  Like the migration, it was another immense, unfolding wonder, happening entirely on its own, utterly indifferent to us, the little Sowash family, and thus, awe-inspiring.  Faces upturned, mouths open, hushed, we cast our eyes skyward, feeling tenderly toward one another, vulnerable and small.\r\n\r\nAt such moments, the distinctions that seem so important in common hours -- the nuanced distinctions we make between Liberal and Conservative, say -- surrender all significance.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, the Heartland Symphony Orchestra, a spirited community orchestra serving Brainerd and Little Falls, Minnesota — two more good, old, American-sounding place-names — commissioned me to write an orchestral suite in honor of the orchestra''s 35th anniversary.  I wrote a five-movement piece called North Country Suite which they premiered in April of 2012.  \r\n\r\nThe second movement, entitled “Northern Lights,” strives to express the bewildered reverence we feel at those rare moments when we confront the essential truth that only Nature can teach us:  that our brief, tiny lives are acted out upon an unutterably tremendous, unthinkably ancient, imponderably mysterious and almost inconceivably beautiful stage that is not of our making.\r\n\r\nTo hear Josh Aerie conducting the Heartland Symphony Orchestra''s premiere performance of "Northern Lights" from North Country Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 20, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),137);

That''s a little awkward in English, so I simplified it to: "We Sang, We Danced."  But it doesn''t mean quite the same thing.  "We used to sing, we used to dance" is a little wistful, something we might say with a sad smile and a sigh for the good old days ... that is what the trio’s Tango movement attempts to express. \r\n\r\nIt is, however, a fiction.  The truth is, I''ve never danced a Tango in my life.  I am not and will never be a person who can look back on the days when I used to go Tango dancing.  Sigh. Such a beautiful thing, the Tango, a little sentimental, a little over the top.  In the end, the piece is about my imagining what it might be like to look back and remember having sung and danced the night away, back in the long-lost days of our Youth.\r\n\r\nI must admit, however, that even as I write those words, they seem faintly ridiculous.  Well, so is this Tango, I admit.  Occasionally, I''ve attempted to write music that hovers on the very line that separates an homage from a parody.  This Tango is one such instance.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear this Tango, I wonder what you''ll think?  Will you hear it as a loving homage to a marvelous genre? or will you think that I''m parodying the Tango?  Is it possible for music to be both an homage and a parody?\r\n\r\nSee what you think.  \r\n\r\nI have never heard this trio performed live.  Les Gavottes dis-assembled before they were able to perform it.  It has only been performed in public twice and I was not able to attend either concert.

The calendar indicates it and there is no snow here at the moment, but gray skies prevail and not a hint of green is to be seen anywhere.  Which brings to mind a poem I love ....\r\n\r\nDo you carry poems in your memory and recite them to yourself sometimes?  When Spring arrives, even if only on the calendar, I pull up from memory Vachel Lindsay''s "The Flower-Fed Buffaloes."  It''s not one of those joyful, "Spring is here!" poems.  It''s a hushed reflection on early Spring, prompting us ponder all that has been lost.  \r\n\r\nBuffaloes, for instance.\r\n\r\nStrange to think that, "in the days of long ago," vast herds of buffalo made their way through southwestern Ohio.   Right here where I live, in what is now the edge of downtown Cincinnati, uncountable thousands somehow discerned that, just here, the Ohio River was shallow enough for them to safely traverse each Spring, as the vast herds made their way to fresh pastures.\r\n\r\nThe river, the land, the Spring are all still here but corn, wheat and wheels have replaced the flowers, and the buffaloes that fed on the flower, and the people who fed on the buffaloes.  A whole world that was here, just three lifetimes ago ... vanished.  It''s something to ponder on a grim March day.\r\n\r\nI set the poem to music, back in "the days of long ago," in April of 1975, when I was 25 years old.  The Blues-y tune is unaccompanied by piano or guitar; it''s just a solitary voice, singing simply and powerfully, like the poet''s voice in the poem:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER-FED BUFFALOES\r\n\r\nThe flower-fed buffaloes of the spring\r\nIn the days of long ago,\r\nRanged where the locomotives sing\r\nAnd the prairie flowers like low.\r\nThe tossing, blooming, perfumed grass\r\nIs swept away by wheat,\r\nWheels and wheels and wheels spin by\r\nIn the spring that still is sweet.\r\nBut the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring\r\nLeft us long ago,\r\nThey gore no more, they bellow no more,\r\nThey trundle around these hills no more--\r\nWith the Blackfeet lying low,\r\nWith the Pawnees lying low.\r\n\r\nCan you spare 84 seconds to hear The Flower Fed Buffaloes sung marvelously well by baritone Noel Bouley?

Mary’s lively and gracious manner, her delightful sense of humor and her ardent love of classical music has inspired everyone who crosses her path.  \r\n\r\nIn 1979, Mary took ill and was absent from work for six weeks.

An hour later the musicians were seated in front of their music stands, sawing away, and John was sitting in the back, headphones on, tweaking knobs. Suddenly, "Tweet!  tweet!"

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(16,replace(replace('When April arrives, we say, “At last!”\r\n\r\nHere is one small way to celebrate.  Listen the opening movement of my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano.  It’s the second of thirteen trios I wrote for three French musicians who call themselves "les Gavottes."  I entitled the trio "Enchantement d''avril" (Enchantment of April) because the movements are expansions of songs I had written earlier, setting to music a scene from Elizabeth von Arnim''s novel, "The Enchanted April."  \r\n\r\nYou probably haven''t read the novel;  it''s not very well known; but you may remember the 1993 film Enchanted April, based on the novel.  It''s one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nIf you haven''t read the book or seen the film, well, you certainly know what April is about.\r\n\r\nApril is majestic and miraculous, a kingly re-birth, a meteorological High Renaissance. Accordingly, the movement begins (and ends) with a majestic fanfare; then a rising, trilling clarinet bridges us to a livelier music, though contemplative and pastoral.  Think of this music as a painting, a landscape; soft sheets of gray rain slant across the greening, breeze-tossed branches of trees; clusters of daffodils, gloriously white and yellow, dapple the foreground.\r\n\r\nThe music is in B flat major.  How could it not be?  Such a bright and brassy yellow key!  \r\nwith glimmering highlights of purest white.  At least that''s how B flat major seems to me.  \r\n\r\nYes, I''m one of those for whom keys have colors -- except for C major, which is colorless, clear. F major is pale green.  G major is Kelly green.  E major is bright red.  A major is pale orange while F sharp minor is a gnarled brown.  E flat major is bright blue while E flat minor is deep indigo.  A flat major is purple, F minor even moreso.  And so on ....\r\n\r\nHere then is my April music, cast in B flat major.\r\n\r\nTo hear "les Gavottes" play the opening movement of Trio #2 “Enchantment of April,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 6, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nListen to the closing movement of my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Enchantment of April.”  \r\n\r\nWritten specifically for three French musicians who call themselves "les Gavottes,” the music was intended to have a French inflection.  I think it could serve as the film score for one of those sweet, little French movies, shot in Paris, about shy people falling in love.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, les Gavottes took to this music because, they told me, it sounded so American!  I remember Lucien, the clarinetist, saying, as we listened to their recording of the work, “This part always makes me think of the American West!”, pantomiming a galloping cowboy, reins in one hand, waving an imaginary hat with the other.  I laughed with him, but what I hear is the French influence.  I guess the music is best described as Franco-American.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with the French language when I was 20, the result of an intense, summer-long affair — a ten-week immersion course at Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nLike any twenty-something, I yearned to visit Paris.  But as the years passed, other priorities forestalled the dream.  College, career, children, mortgage payments, the usual stuff.\r\n\r\nThen one day (as storytellers say), I received a letter from a Parisian clarinetist, Jean-Noel Martin, requesting the sheet music for works he’d heard on a CD recording of my music which he’d found at a Paris record store.  Remember record stores?\r\n\r\nI sent him the scores for free and we became pen-pals.  I''d write to him in French; he''d reply in English, both of us practicing our second languages.  This was before e-mail.  Remember letters?\r\n\r\nAfter two years he invited me to come over.  I was thrilled!  Jean-Noel met me at Charles DeGaulle airport and squired me back to his tiny apartment to show me how things worked there.  He moved out, lodged with a friend during my eleven-day visit, letting me use his flat.  All for free.  Un vrai ami!\r\n\r\nHis apartment was tiny; the bed occupied two-thirds of the floor space.  It was on the fifth floor of one of those classic old Parisian apartment buildings.  There was no elevator.  The toilet-closet was down the hall, shared with the floor’s other tenants.  The hallway light switch was timed to turn itself off after 90 seconds;  unless you could find a light switch again, you made the return journey from the toilet-closet in pitch darkness.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment had a tiny sink, a two-burner hot plate, a refrigerator the size of a waste-basket, a tiny desk, and book shelves on every inch of the walls.  Its one window, viewless, looked out only upon the building’s opposite wing.  I loved everything about it! \r\n\r\nI didn’t see much of Jean-Noel after the first day;  he had his job, lessons to teach, rehearsals to attend.  In two or three brief rendezvous, he gave me written lists of suggested activities and sites to visit with directions, things to seek out, notice, appreciate.\r\n\r\nEvery day, I walked and walked and walked, exploring as many neighborhoods as possible.  I was 41 by that time, but in good shape.  Even so, there were afternoons when my tired legs forced me back to the apartment, just to put up my feet and rest, poring over guide books the while.\r\n\r\nParis was marvelous, exhilarating.  The architecture, cafés, parks, museums, monuments, people, the Métro, the beautiful language.  Things ‘clicked’ for me, dozens of times, every day.  I stumbled upon a street named the Rue Nicot.  A little sign explained that it was named for Jean Nicot who introduced tobacco to the French, presenting it to the queen mother, Catherine de Medici, a cure for her migraines.  Fashionable people took up the practice and Nicot became a celebrity.  Thus originated the word ... “nicotine.”\r\n\r\nI’ve always hated smoking, but this was fascinating.  it’s one example of how my understanding of things large and small was expanded by a myriad of minute discoveries made daily in Paris.\r\n\r\nI became obsessed with a desire to return … and I’ve managed to get back to France seven times since that first visit in 1991.  Sometimes alone, sometimes with wife and children, sometimes with friends.  \r\n\r\nLa Belle France has enriched my life, immensely.  And inspired me, too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my affection and gratitude is expressed in this Franco-American music.

He is credited with "Black is the Color of My True Love''s Hair," "I Wonder as I Wander," and "Go ''Way from My Window" ... three of our most beautiful American folk songs.  I saw him at one of his last performances, around 1978.  He was 85 and spell-binding.  He sang in a sweet falsetto, accompanying himself on a giant dulcimer, the size of a cello.\r\n\r\nI was very moved by his performance and I wrote this piece in 1980 as a response and tribute, a cycle of songs for soprano accompanied only by a cello, reminiscent of Nile''s falsetto accompanied only by that giant dulcimer.  It is a setting of six beautiful, pure, simple poems by Sarah Teasdale, about a woman''s responses to love.  \r\n\r\nToo, I wrote the piece as a performance vehicle for married friends -- a soprano and a cellist.  They were a lovely pair in those days and the piece expressed the lovely quality everyone saw in their relationship, though it did not last.  Strangely, the poems touch on the transience of love, too, though I did not think about that at the time.  I’ll include the poems below.\r\n\r\nOne time in Paris, I played this piece for a French soprano, trying to play the cello part on the piano and singing the songs as best I could, roughly translating into French as I went along.  That was a challenge!  When I finished, she asked me to play it again.  Midway through, she suddenly made a strange choking sound.  I thought she was laughing.  I looked around to find that she had burst into tears.  It was a little unsettling for us both, but one of the best compliments ever given to my music.  \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago the cycle was recorded by Susan Olson, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on my vocal music.  The only people who have heard this piece have been those in attendance, here and there, when it has been performed live.  Sharing music with you through these mpFrees has allowed works like this to come to the ears of friends and fans who would never hear it otherwise.  I am deeply grateful to have this technology and to have an audience for it in the form of the recipients of these mpFree messages.\r\n\r\nAt 12 min., 15 seconds, the piece is a little longer than those I usually send but I hope you will take the time to listen to it all the way through.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(20,replace(replace('Sage''s Ravine is the third movement of a large work I wrote in 1992 entitled, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail for violin, French horn, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nThe four places are depicted in the order in which a northern bound thru-hiker would encounter them:\r\n\r\nI.  Amicalola Falls - a 400-foot cascade in northern Georgia\r\nII.  Dragon’s Tooth – an outcropping in Virginia, shaped like a giant canine tooth\r\nIII.  Sage’s Ravine – a darkly shaded slice on the border of Connecticut and Massachusetts\r\nIV.  Katahdin – the northern terminus of the trail in Maine\r\n\r\nI have hiked through Sage''s Ravine.  I didn''t encounter any sages there, but I like to fancy that it''s a place where sages might be encountered -- New England sages, modern day Emerson’s and Thoreau’s. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is a sage?  What makes someone a sage? What do sages do?\r\n\r\nIn the words of Odell Shepard, a latter-day New England sage whose writings I admire, a sage "thinks freely --  not as the member of any party, organization, institution, religion, caste, class, nation, or club, not as one having a reputation to gain or support, but simply as one man with his center inside himself, answerable to nothing but the truth ... such thinking as this [is] the hardest work and the finest sport in the world.”\r\n\r\nWhat do they think about, these sages?  They ponder the reconciliation of opposites:  joy and sorrow, good and evil, the sacred and the profane. They strive to perceive the larger whole that contains those opposites.\r\n\r\nFrom birth we are confronted with opposites:  wake and sleep, day and night, hungry and full, mother and father.  Later, we devise mental constructs to help us grapple with more complex opposites:  young and old, past and future, boy and girl, right and wrong.  We cannot unite into a larger whole any of the opposites we encounter in life; we can only try to arrange them into an order that makes some sense.\r\n\r\nFor Western societies, the reconciliation of opposites is a theological problem.  How can an omnipotent, loving God allow the existence of evil?  If God does not create evil, then is it self-creating? implying that God is not omnipotent after all?  \r\n\r\nThe believer must simultaneously accept two contradicting ideas:  the goodness of God and the existence of Evil.  For many people, including a few whom I love, this is impossible.  For them, the existence of Evil obviates the existence of God.  \r\n\r\nThey ask, "If God is God, then how can Evil be?  How can we thank God when good things happen but exculpate God when bad things happen?"\r\n\r\nTheologians posit various responses.  But most believers -- I am one -- only shrug and say, "We just do, that''s all."\r\n\r\nGod is good, yet Evil exists.  These two opposing assertions create a strain in all of us, believers and non-believers alike.  It affects everything, including the way our artists shape their work and the way we respond to their work.\r\n\r\nThe stress of our inability to reconcile these opposites resonates when we encounter a work of art that succeeds in reconciling opposites into a coherent and pleasing pattern, be it a painting, a play or a musical composition.  It seems to me that Western art, when it achieves this, is at its very best.  Indeed, it seems to be the principal difference between the relatively few artistic  expressions that touch my heart and the many other expressions to which I am indifferent.\r\n\r\nTo cite the most famous example:  think of Mona Lisa''s smile emerging from that dreary landscape.  There are myriad others:  remember how skillfully and satisfyingly Cezanne''s greens reconcile his opposing blues and oranges?  and the way his forms are depicted simultaneously from differing points of view?  those apparently twisted tables, tilting teapots, floating apples and oranges?  \r\n\r\nOpposites are everywhere in Western music;  the works of Bach and Beethoven are replete with them:  jerky vs. smooth, energetic vs. plaintive, loud vs. soft, fast vs. slow, major vs. minor, the opposing tonic and dominant keys of a fugue or the sonata-allegro form.  \r\n\r\nThe most salient characteristics of Shakespeare''s characters are their ambiguities -- those wise fools, those flawed heroes, those villains who, maddeningly, mouth such good advice --  they are believable precisely because they are contradictory!  And we love the Bard for having gifted us with them. \r\n\r\nHere at least, we feel, here at last -- if rarely in Life -- we find opposites reconciled and we rejoice in it!.  \r\n\r\n(Contrariwise, the absence of opposites in a work of art renders it boring.  We quickly tire of a flawless hero, a relentlessly villainous villain, a merely foolish fool, a painter who cannot take us beyond a narrow spectrum of form and color, a repetitive pop song with a never-varying beat, a cramped melodic range and the same, tired chords  --  boring!) \r\n\r\nIn Sage''s Ravine, I tried to depict sagacity by attempting to reconcile two opposing musics -- the music of sorrow and the music of joy.  First comes the sorrowful music -- slow, mournful, in a minor key.  Then comes a quietly joyous music, a tune that conjoins elements of Jesu, Joy of Man''s Desiring with the American folksong Shenandoah.  The opposites are established, repeated, and finally reconciled in what I hope is a coherent and pleasing pattern.\r\n\r\nTo hear Sages Ravine, beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2012, public radio station WMRA of Harrisonburg, VA broadcast an interview with me about my Four Places on the Appalachian Trail on a program called "The Spark."

That’s the name of a dramatic upthrust of rock, atop a remote mountain ridge in southwestern Virginia.  Its topmost tip offers a 360-degree view, one of very few on the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nYou don’t casually stroll up there for a look-see.  Dragon’s Tooth is very hard to get to, a long, steep, upward clamber, especially difficult when carrying, as I did, a 45-pound backpack full of gear and food for an eight-day, 80-mile hike.  I made that hike with a group of friends when I was in my mid-thirties, trim and fit.  Even so, it just about did me in.  That 80-mile hike was the most physically challenging thing I’ve done.\r\n\r\nDragon’s Tooth is all about energy.  Energy to get up there.  And the immense energy of the Dragon, asleep under the mountain, his one, huge, ruthless tooth protruding.  When he awakes, Lord help us!\r\n\r\nThe music I wrote about the place has a lot of energy, too.  It’s the second movement of my Suite for violin, French horn, cello and piano, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the oldest myths of Western Civilization:  a dragon guarding a great prize, be it a beautiful princess or a treasure of gems, jewelry and gold.  It’s a static situation; the energy is kinetic.  What’s needed is a hero to slay the dragon, fructify the princess and/or redistribute the hoard.  Sure enough, a hero always arrives, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nAs with all great myths, it’s happening right now in the most intimate of human relations as well as the most public.\r\n\r\nMost likely, you know or have known instances of it.  I have.  I was once the close friend of a beautiful, childless princess/treasure/woman whose dragon/husband was selfish, sarcastic and neglectful.  I’m not in the business of rescuing princesses, but it wasn’t long before a suitable hero came along.  He rescued the princess and the two of them have been together now for about fifteen years.  The relationship has been, so I hear, fruitful and rewarding for both of them.\r\n\r\nThe Dragon myth speaks to public life as well.  It offers a dark warning to The One Percent.  Sooner or later, your hoarded treasure will be forcibly released from your grasp.  Your gated communities will not avail you.  The only question is whether your wealth will be redistributed peacefully (by means of taxation) or violently (by means of riots, revolution, the guillotine).  It''s the tax or the ax.  One or the other.  Only a matter of time.  Me, I''d advocate the peaceful means, but it’s not up to me to decide!  Who listens to a composer’s thoughts on such matters?  It’s just as well.  I don''t want the responsibility.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear evocations of the Dragon-Princess/Treasure-Hero myth in this music … the fierce energy of the dragon, the allure of the princess/treasure, the valor of the hero, the inexorability of Fate.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Dragon’s Tooth,”  beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 17, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),63);

It''s one of the most delightful pieces to have come through me. \r\n\r\nBellville is the village in north central Ohio where I met my future wife, fell in love with her, courted, married and lived for twelve years.  Our two children were born there.  I loved Bellville during those years.\r\n\r\nI was 27 years old in 1977 and it was one of the best years of my life.  I had no regular job and was painting houses, off and on, for most of that happy year;  I had plenty of spare time.  I wrote some of the best music of my career.  I earnestly tried to create a musical style that would express my immediate environs:  Bellvillle, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nThe challenge of figuring out how to express my immediate location inspired me.  I thought that music composed in an Ohio village ought to sound subtly different than music written in, say, Nebraska or Vermont.  I undertook to become a Regionalist composer.  No one had ever attempted such a thing in Bellville, Ohio!  I was a pioneer!\r\n	\r\nRegionalism has been a major force in American literature and painting, and also in American music.  Charles Ives’ programmatic pieces express his New England, just as Gershwin’s jagged, sky-line melodies and Bernstein’s big-city rhythms express New York City; Oklahoman Roy Harris’ Third Symphony captures the massive spaciousness of the Great Plains; Ferde Grofe’s dear, old, Western-sounding Grand Canyon Suite conjurs that landscape perfectly;  Aaron Copland caught the Midwest in The Tender Land, the West in Rodeo and Billy the Kid, New England in his Suite from Our Town and the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachian Spring (oh, I know he didn''t name that piece until after it was completed but listeners everywhere envision the Appalachians when they hear that music).\r\n\r\nEach of these composers evoked particular American landscapes.  Their best-loved regionalist works have found a place in the hearts of music-loving audiences all over the world.  \r\n\r\nI studied these works and took a lesson from them.  My piano trio, Four Seasons in Bellville, was the best result.  The tunes are lyrical and abundant, the harmonies lush and rich, like the fabled soil of Richland County, Ohio, where Bellville is located.  Richland County’s topsoil is sometimes eight feet deep!  The best vegetable garden we ever had was in our backyard in Bellville.\r\n	\r\nThis trio is a four-movement work, of course, one for each season.  Music about Spring must suggest color, movement, growth and romantic love.  Think of wild flowers, refreshing rains, filmy, yellow-y, breeze-tossed branches and burgeoning streams.  \r\n\r\nTo hear "Spring" from Four Seasons in Bellville, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 11, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),71);

Those are journey forms:  you''re here, you depart, you come back.  That simple.  \r\n\r\nSimpler yet:  theme & variations.  A tune gets repeated, each time differently.

Structure the whole piece so that the variations seem to be going somewhere, heading for a destination.  We can tolerate repetition in music, as in life, only so long as we sense that there is a larger purpose being served, a direction unfolding.\r\n\r\nMost of my music is programmatic;  which is to say that it is ostensibly "about" something non-musical. \r\n\r\nBut the piece I want to share today is not about anything;  it is only about itself.

The cello opens with five notes depicting a wave hovering and then crashing, followed by a longer, rising phrase suggesting a larger heave of water behind it, also making a rising, hovering, then crashing motion.

"I''ll help you."  (He called me Stoogahtz; I never knew why.)\r\n\r\nBetween my 7th and 12th grades, those two teachers taught me 90% of what a composer needs to know.  That''s how strong the music program was in the 1960''s in the public school system of Lexington, Ohio (pop. 4,000).\r\n\r\nMr. Evans was a composer, too, though with a very narrowly defined style.  He wrote short, modal choral works that drew on the musical legacy of his Welsh ancestors.  He instructed me at length, often after school on his own time, teaching me music history, music theory, counterpoint, harmony, orchestration.  Mr. Dunlap did, too.  \r\n\r\nA young man needs an older man, who is outside his family, to affirm him, to let him know that he has value, that he has gifts to bring to the world.  Those two teachers, along with my Scoutmaster Frank Culp and a few others, did that for me.  In turn, I’ve tried to do the same for many younger men in the course of my life.  Indeed, I continue to do this at the school where I teach.    \r\nI learned so much from those two music teachers that in my senior year I was able to write a melodramatic tone poem and to conduct our high school orchestra in the first (and only, thank goodness!) performance.  Looking back, I realize that it wasn’t a very good piece of music but the act of writing it and conducting it was a very big step for me.\r\n\r\nThere was one issue on which Mr. Evans and I could never agree.  We had long, good-natured arguments about musical style.  Mr. Evans felt that a composer should find his one, true style and stick with it.  I disagreed passionately.  What fun would that be?  \r\n\r\n"What if I feel like writing something in the style of Wagner or Gershwin or Mozart?"\r\n\r\n"Why would you want to do that?"\r\n\r\n"Because it''s fun, that''s why!"\r\n\r\n"But you''re not Wagner or Gershwin or Mozart.  You''re Rick Sowash.  Figure out what Rick Sowash''s music ought to sound like and then write that."\r\n\r\nWorking within a narrow style suited Mr. Evans; for me, that would have been suffocating, a self-imposed prison sentence.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, I’ve never fussed about my “style.”  When ideas sought me out I brought them to reality as best I could, never considering whether or not I was being consistent with my style, whatever that might be.  \r\n\r\nFrankly, I don''t think I have a compositional style.  Yet friends tell me that when they hear my music on the radio, they know it''s mine -- because they recognize my style!  Go figure.\r\n\r\nIt''s a strange thing to step back and consider one''s own life''s work.  For a long time, your life’s work something that is ahead of you.

Making people smile gives me joy and, having lived my whole life in mid-America, my music is bound to sound American.  \r\n\r\nWhat about my ethnic heritage?  If Mr. Evans'' music grew out of his Welsh heritage, then out of what heritages did my music grow?\r\n\r\nMy father''s ancestors were French; I speak and teach French and I adore France; some of my work sounds a little French-y.  My mother''s parents were Austro-Hungarians, from the region that is called Serbia today, though they considered themselves Germans, not Serbs.   Sure enough, an Eastern European sound sometimes pops up in my music as well.  \r\n\r\nListen to this, for instance:  a short, bluesy cello cadenza is followed by a "Galop" that blends my American and Eastern European musical DNAs.

It''s said that when friends entered Brahms'' apartment after he died, they found Scott Joplin''s "Maple Leaf Rag" on the Master''s piano.  Brahms must have been intrigued by this new American music!\r\n\r\nEleven and a half decades later, the popularity of Ragtime has not faded.  It''s a musical perennial.\r\n\r\nMy woodwind quintet, Three American Perennials (1974), contributes to three musical genres of which Americans have never tired:  folk dances, sea chanteys and ragtime.  \r\n\r\nRags are usually scored for solo piano but part of the fun of this piece is hearing a rag played, improbably, by the five ill-matched instruments, each very different from the rest, that comprise the woodwind quintet.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of original tunes comes, at the very end, "Jolly Redwing," played by the French horn in counterpoint to everything else that''s going on.  It''s a tribute to my Grandpa Sowash who loved to play that tune on the banjo and said it was his favorite.\r\n\r\nTake three and a half minutes and give a listen to HarmoniaV, a Connecticut-based wind quintet, giving a spirited and extraordinarily precise rendition -- these guys are really good! -- of the Ragtime movement by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 6, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIn the 1958 film “The Last Hurrah,” Spencer Tracy, as Mayor Frank Skeffington, poses a question to Jeffrey Hunter, who plays the Mayor''s nephew.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me this.  What would you consider to be the greatest spectator sport in the country today?  Would you say it’s basketball?  baseball?  football?  It’s politics. That’s right, politics.  Millions and millions of people, following it every day … They know the names and the numbers of all the players.”\r\n\r\nHe’s right!  What a spectacle!  Never boring.  And so much more at stake than with mere ball games.  Of what consequence is a sports victory, after all?  How will our lives be any different, win or lose, after “the big game?”  Contrariwise, the consequences of American elections are global.\r\n\r\nThe perennial presidential election process is a dizzying whirl of sweeping promises, comic blunders, shrewd calculations, stupid ideas that “seemed good at the time,” the bartering of cash for influence.  Every time, we hear the boast: “I don’t need their cash!”  Don’t you believe it!  Then there’s the sign-making, flag-waving, door-to-dooring, ringing endorsements, bombastic trumpeting, the glorification of buffoonery.  \r\n\r\nEvery election cycle we are assured that, this time, it’s “a battle for the very heart and soul of the country.”  Oh yes, it''s a stark choice between the abyss if their candidate wins and paradise-on-earth if our candidate wins.  Afterwards, neither is realized.  They must now be RE-elected because:  “We’ve come a long way, but we have a long way to go!”  \r\n\r\nThink of it!  The thing steams on for almost two years before the actual vote, picking up momentum, accelerando e crescendo poco a poco.  \r\n\r\nSporting matches, by contrast, last a couple of hours, tops.\r\n\r\nThe zaniness of American political life springs from — what else? — the frenetic energy of our intense, outspoken, multiloquent populace.   \r\n\r\nWe the People bubble and rumble with joy and disgust, hope and despair, laughter and bitterness.  What sports fan emotes as deeply as the impassioned politico?\r\n\r\nAmerican political life would be insufferable if it weren’t so fascinating, so entertaining.\r\n\r\nHow to express, musically, this tumble-jumble, this rannygazoo of immense assurances and petty connivance?   \r\n\r\nWay back in 1974, during the doomed presidency of Richard Nixon, I took a shot at expressing precisely that tumble-jumble in the first of my Three American Perennials for woodwind quintet, a salmagundi of original folk-like tunes set alongside authentic American folk-tunes including “Old Dan Tucker,” “Camptown Races” and, at the very end, ironically, “Simple Gifts.”\r\n\r\nWhy do I say ironically?  That strong and simple Shaker tune gets touted as being somehow emblematic of America.  In a way it is, sure.  We love that tune and what Aaron Copland did with it in his “Appalachian Spring.”  \r\n\r\nBut while this American life — particularly our political life -- gifts us with constant, peppery, dangerous entertainment, it is anything but simple.  \r\n\r\nOnce only in my composing career, in writing this exuberant, chaotic first movement, have I tried to convey an aural image of political complexity energized to the edge of insanity.  Accordingly, the music is acrid, almost sinister, a little harsh but somehow good-hearted.  Then and now, especially during presidential campaigns, that''s how American society seems to me.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the end, at 3:33, you’ll hear the French horn ripping out six glissandos. Think of those as the trumpetings of the Republican elephant.  Are they a shrill heralding of victory?  or shrieks of despair at the realization that, for the coming term, while the losing side is mired in the Slough of Despond, the victors will hold the office that was so hotly contested?  I couldn’t say.  Music itself has no party affiliation.\r\n\r\nRight after the last horn glissando the movement abruptly ends with a snatch of “Simple Gifts.”   \r\n\r\nSimple?  America?  "AS IF!"   \r\n\r\nGive a listen to HarmoniaV, a Connecticut wind quintet, giving a spirited, witty and extraordinarily precise rendition -- these guys are really good! -- of the first movement by clicking on the link above. \r\n\r\nYou can also click on the link above to see a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 28, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),48);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(26,replace(replace('In 2011, my clarinet concerto was performed and recorded by David Drosinos and the St. Petersburg Symphony.  For me, it was a big deal.  It was the first of my orchestral works to be recorded and the only one performed by a major European orchestra. \r\n\r\nHere''s how it happened ....\r\n\r\nIn 1991, I made my first trip to Paris, where I befriended French clarinetist Lucien Aubert.  He asked me to write several pieces for him -- a quintet for clarinet and strings, two reed trios and a piece called Voyage of the Spirit which turned out to be the first of no less than thirteen clarinet, cello and piano trios I was to write for Lucien over the next decade and a half.\r\n\r\nI had already written for clarinet and liked the instrument very much but when Lucien requested these pieces, I concentrated on the instrument.  To date, I''ve written 51 works featuring the clarinet.  For me, it has come to be an autobiographical instrument.  For better or worse, I see my character and personality reflected in the clarinet;  it can be foolish or wise, sarcastic or noble, trite or impassioned, funny or dead earnest.  Same goes for your friend, the undersigned.\r\n\r\nFinding ways to couple the clarinet and the cello, with the piano as a backdrop, proved so compelling that I almost could not stop writing works for that combination of instruments.  There was so much to explore, so many possibilities.  That''s why I''ve written more for that combination of instruments than for any other.\r\n\r\nStylistically, the thirteen trios zig-zag wildly as they progress;  each is in some way the opposite of its predecessor.  Taken altogether, they form a trajectory, aiming all along at my epic-length clarinet concerto, though I did not realize it at the time I was writing these trios.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, when I was about half-way through the writing of my thirteen trios, my Italian-American clarinetist friend Angelo Santoro asked me to write a one-movement work for clarinet and orchestra which he could premiere with the Cincinnati Community Orchestra.  I complied with The View from Carew, a Romance for clarinet and orchestra.\r\n\r\nAngelo premiered it, playing beautifully as he always does, a noble presence with his silver mustache and black tuxedo.  Afterwards he informed me that the Romance was destined to be the slow, middle movement of a full-length three-movement concerto and that now I must write the other two movements!  He kept after me, phoning me every couple months to ask how the concerto was coming along.  Finally, in the summer of 2007 I accepted the challenge of writing the substantial outer movements that an expansive middle movement would require.\r\n\r\nI wanted the concerto to be like a large mural in a public place.  I wanted it to express suitably large ideas.  I wanted to affirm my conviction that tonality, tunefulness and traditional musical architecture are as powerfully expressive as ever in our 21st century.  I wanted the concerto to convey optimism, friendship, love of Nature; I wanted it to brim with joy.  I wanted it to sound American, to evoke our country''s spaciousness and potential, mixing elements of folk music and jazz and extending the film score devices of the great Hollywood westerns. \r\n\r\nI wanted the solo clarinet''s relationship with the orchestra to be that of a friend and a teacher -- not an adversary.  I wanted the clarinet to present gifts to the orchestra -- exuberant, celebratory tunes that the orchestra could joyfully “learn” and play in turn.  Most of all, I wanted you, the listeners, to experience the piece as a gift, a most welcome gift.\r\n\r\nI became so excited writing this piece that there were times when sleep evaded me.  I could not turn off the music that came pouring into my head.  Some days I worked for nine hours straight, resenting the pauses I had to make in order to eat or visit the bathroom!\r\n\r\nBy winter, the concerto was complete and, thanks to a grant Angelo got from the Cincinnati Foundation, he premiered it the following April with the Clermont Philharmonic, the community orchestra he founded many years ago.\r\n\r\nI wanted clarinetists to know about this piece.  Googling assiduously, I found the names and email addresses of a couple hundred clarinet professors.  I sent each a cheery email, introducing myself and the concerto, attaching an mp3 of Angelo''s performance and a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nA half dozen responded.  A month later, one of those, David Drosinos of Baltimore, MD, was asked by the conductor of the St. Petersburg Symphony if he would like to record a CD with that orchestra and if he knew of any new American clarinet concerto that had not yet been recorded.  "Do I ever!" he replied and they recorded mine.  \r\n\r\nDo you imagine that these things just happen?  No.  Recording is how post-Soviet orchestras survive without the government support they once enjoyed.  David, bless his heart, funded the entire project out of his retirement savings.   The expense was enormous.  You would be shocked to know the amount.  When I thanked him, he said, "Well, what else could I do to advance my career? rent Carnegie Hall and do a recital?  What would that mean to anybody, really?  This way, I got to do the premiere recording with a major orchestra of a concerto I really like.  And, from now on, whenever your concerto is broadcast on American classical radio stations, my name will be mentioned as the soloist."  \r\n\r\nTrue enough.  Thank you, David, with all my heart.  And Angelo, my good friend.\r\n\r\nSome time I''ll send you the other two movements.  \r\n\r\nFor now, please listen to David Drosinos and the St. Petersburg Symphony play the third movement from my Clarinet Concerto.

Well, you chucklehead, there’s the conductor, in person, the Maestro himself, sitting right over there, not fifteen feet behind you.”\r\n\r\nI twisted my chucklehead around to look across the crowded restaurant and, sure enough, there he was, breakfasting and holding forth before a half dozen adoring associates.  I couldn’t make out what he was saying but he was clearly telling a story.  He was making wide gestures, pointing both forefingers toward the ceiling as he spoke, waving them around as if directing a hovering host of angels, invisible to the rest of us.\r\n\r\n“All you have to do,” urged my friend, "is stand up, go over to his table and introduce yourself!  Tell him you want the orchestra to play your concerto!  Tell him your buddy bet you a hundred bucks that you wouldn''t have the nerve to do it.  What have you got to lose?”\r\n\r\nI poked moodily at my scrambled egg burrito.  “That’s not how it’s done,” I murmured.\r\n\r\n“Well then, make an appointment and go see him in his office.”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t see me.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Anyway, I’d be embarrassed.  Successful composers don''t do such things.  Philip Glass? John Adams?  They don’t contact conductors.  Conductors contact them.”\r\n\r\nA great burst of laughter erupted over at the conductor’s table.  He had arrived at the punchline.\r\n\r\n“So what’s Plan B?  Wait a minute!  I have it!  Next time the symphony is going to perform, you get to Music Hall early and chain yourself to the railing, right out in front, where everybody can see you.  Tell ‘em you refuse to take nourishment until the orchestra promises to do your concerto.  In short order, the police will hacksaw through your chains and plop you into the hoosegow.  You''ll have to pay a small fine, sure.  But take the big, broad, flexible outlook.  Think of the free publicity!  What a news story that would make!  ‘Local composer arrested for trying to persuade the Cincinnati Symphony to perform his clarinet concerto.  Details at Eleven.''  How about it?” \r\n\r\n“I know you mean well, but --”\r\n\r\n“Okay.  How about this?  We’ll order a bunch of of bright yellow t-shirts and have ‘em printed up to say, ‘Play Sowash’s Clarinet Concerto.”  Then we’ll get all your friends and fans to wear them while forming a human chain around Music Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Yellow?”\r\n\r\n“Green, then.  Purple.  Fuschia.  Whatever.  Doesn’t matter.  The important thing is:  no one gets in or out of that human chain until the Symphony agrees to —“\r\n\r\n“Oh, brother.”\r\n\r\n“How about a petition drive!  You’d be the first composer ever to do such a thing.  Start right now, here in this restaurant.  Take your napkin around to every table and ask them to sign —“\r\n\r\n“Now, look here.  I’m not going to —”\r\n\r\n“Or just do whatever it is you need to do to win a MacArthur Genius Award or the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Or, better yet, the Legion of Honor.  You’ve got friends in France.  Ask them to pull a few strings!  The Symphony will be knocking at your door!”\r\n\r\n“Right.  Like any of that’s gonna happen.”\r\n\r\n“You''re such a mugwump!  Here’s the best idea yet!  You HIRE the Symphony to play your concerto.  They’re in business like anyone else.  How much do you suppose they would charge?”\r\n\r\n“$100,000 — at least.”\r\n\r\n“No problem.  How old are you?  65?  Okay, then.  You’ve got ten years before Rick Sowash''s Big 75th Birthday Celebration Concert.  Put aside a mere $10,000 a year and, bingo, you’ll have exactly enough Happy Cabbage to hire the Symphony.”\r\n\r\n“10,000 a year?  Gulp.”\r\n\r\n“Make it your 80th birthday then.  Put aside $6,666 a year.  You shake your head?  Then make it your 90th birthday celebration.  You’ll only have to squirrel away four thousand clams a year.  Again, this head shaking?  I can’t believe my eyes.  Alright-y then.  Make it your hundredth birthday!  You’ve got thirty-five years to raise the moolah.  Where''s my calculator?  That’s $2850 per year.   $237 per month.  Less than a car payment.  Eight smackers a day.   Are you going to sit there and tell me that you can’t cough up eight smackers a day to get the Symphony to play your clarinet concerto?

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(27,replace(replace('I love to write for the voice.  I''ve written a hundred choral works and almost as many songs. Writing vocal music is easy for me, almost effortless.  Fun, too.  The hard part is finding a suitable text. \r\n\r\nWhat makes a text suitable?  Simplicity, sincerity and good vowels. \r\n\r\nSimple?  When sung, English is sometimes difficult to understand.  The words must be simple.  As Winston Churchill said, "Short words are best and the old ones are best of all."  \r\n\r\nSincere?  Another Englishman, Ralph Vaughan Williams, said, "There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers."\r\n\r\nGood vowels?  Ahhh, oooh, uhhh and ohhh.  Diphthongs are nasty to sing.  So is the short "i" as in "which."  Speaking of "which," it''s best to avoid texts with nasty consonant clusters like "wh" and "ch" and "st" and "sp."\r\n\r\nThe text must have something to say.  It doesn''t have to be great, just something.  The lyrics to Schubert''s most famous song, "The Trout," summarized:  "A happy trout swims in a clear brook until he gets caught by a fisherman."  That''s a great song text?  Ah, but what Schubert does with it!  The sunny day, the bubbling stream, the joy of swimming and of youth, your whole life ahead of you, all of that is in the music; the text is merely the vehicle.\r\n\r\nI said that writing songs was almost effortless.  Let me explain.  I didn''t have to invent a tune for Kathryn Jackson''s little poem "Prairie Prayer."  It sang to me as soon as I set eyes upon it.  \r\n\r\nThe words literally instructed me as to how I should construct the melody.  Prairies are level; the opening four words had to repeat the same note so as to be musically level.   Since mountains are higher than prairies and the sky is higher than mountains, the words in the second line obviously demanded an ascending melody.  That''s just common sense.\r\n\r\nThe words "here in the middle am I" must be placed in the singer''s mid-range, half way between the notes assigned to the prairie and those assigned to the sky.  That’s a ‘no-brainer.’\r\n\r\n"Hills crowd down to the river," must be sung to a descending melody, with flowing eighth notes to suggest the river.  Duh.\r\n\r\nThe climax comes when "the sky bursts out with a million stars," so, of course, the word "sky" must be assigned the highest note of the song.  Finally, "nigh unto God am I" must have a reverential feeling, like a benediction.  \r\n\r\nSee how easy it is?  This song wrote itself.  All I had to do was stay out of the way and notate it.\r\n\r\nI think Richard Rodgers felt the same way about Oscar Hammerstein’s lyrics.  He found that the melody was already implicit in the words.  Just stand back and let ‘em sing.\r\n\r\nIf I had an endless supply of texts like “Prairie Prayer,” I could write a song every day.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Dan Hoy sing this little song, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the sheet music, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 20, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),114);

Composers felt justified in turning away from Beethoven.  \r\n\r\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1989, that justification withered.  For my part, I wanted to write some music that would allow me, in my own small way, in my little corner of the world, to welcome back the spirit of Beethoven.  I wondered if I could devise a music that would blend Beethoven-like gestures with the American idioms that are my legacy.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 Barbara Harbach, who had recorded some of my keyboard music, asked me to write a major work she could perform with a flutist friend.\r\n\r\nI decided to try to write a big, strapping, audacious, Beethovenian/American sonata for flute and piano.  \r\n\r\nBeethoven wrote no flute sonatas.  But if he had, you can bet he would have given the flute an heroic role.  The flute is often cast as the sensitive soul, consigned to the playing of lovely, pale gestures, in pastel tones of lavender and magenta.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to do something different.  I wanted to make the flutist swim for her life.  I assigned the flute bold gestures, bright colors and long phrases, requiring the big breaths we take before plunging into water.  \r\n\r\nToday I want to share the first movement of my flute sonata.  The piano offers a gray, tenuous introduction, bleak and shifting, likes sliding chunks of ice.  Patience!  The piece is establishing its vocabulary:  the musical ideas that follow are derived from combinations of the perfect fourths and minor seconds that are announced in this strange introduction.  Then, the heroic flute makes her entrance;  she is poised, strong and noble, an athletic princess, beautiful and confident.  She takes a deep breath, dives and swims, gloriously.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle, “Icy Waters,” didn’t occur to me until I heard the piece performed by the superb pianist Phil Amalong and his sister Barb Sink.  A fine flutist who is also a marathon runner, she has a bold stage presence and gets a big sound out of her instrument.  While she played this music, there came into my mind the image of a swimmer braving icy waters, challenging herself, perhaps rescuing someone.  What I feel when I hear this music is what I would feel if I plunged into cold water -- braced, refreshed, invigorated, intensely alive.\r\n\r\nFew have heard this music.  So far as I know it''s had only four performances and those were for small audiences.  As it has not been professionally recorded on a CD, I have no means of sharing it except by inviting people to listen to this mp3.\r\n\r\nI have dozens of other scores of which the same is true and I am very eager to share them. Some of the pieces, like this one, can hardly be absorbed in a single hearing.  It''s often that way with music that is new to us.

Thinking that Belo-russian audiences might like to hear what an American composer could do with their country''s folksongs, I asked Corinne to send me a selection of some of the better-known ones.\r\n\r\nI gave those folksongs an "American" treatment, intending to offer a metaphor of hope, cooperation and mutual appreciation between former Soviet Union countries and America in the post-Cold War era.  Let us cherish that hope all the more today as relations falter between our country and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe character of the piece is sunny, hopeful, optimistic, even humorous. \r\n\r\nIf you listen carefully to the beginning of this movement, you will recognize the delightful folk-like tune Prokofiev assigned to the Cat in Peter and the Wolf.  (Alright, that tune is not a Belo-Russian folk song; but close enough.)  I gave it an American inflection by changing the meter, adding a pinch of Copland and a dash of the Blues.  The famous tune is only briefly recognizable; it quickly goes in new directions.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear it you might smile, despite the gloomy news stories.\r\n\r\nThe modified Cat tune is followed by my Americanized version of a rollicking Belo-russian folksong.

He is extraordinarily good at what he does, visually conveying the character of the music and stories I want to share.\r\n\r\nWhat''s more, he commissioned me to compose two works to mark two major events in his life.  I wrote my Mt. Airy Wedding Suite for oboe, violin and cello to be played at his wedding to Michele, which took place in Cincinnati''s lovely Mt. Airy Forest.  And I wrote my Lullabye for Kara for cello and piano to commemorate the birth of his daughter, Kara.\r\n\r\nRandy is a glider enthusiast, owns his own glider, belongs to the Dayton-area glider club founded by Orville Wright.

Sometimes at home I watch DVDs of movies I don''t even like, parts of which positively make me squirm, just so that I can hear, again, a great film score; "The Ten Commandments," "Now, Voyager," and "How The West Was Won," and others.\r\n\r\nI''ve never written a film score, though tracks from my CDs have been featured in several documentaries.  \r\n\r\nOf course, there''s nothing to stop a composer from writing a film score, even without a film. Back in 1979, I did just that.\r\n\r\nWilliam Huggins, a lawyer and amateur violinist in Columbus, OH, commissioned me to write a piece he could perform with friends who played the flute, French horn and harpsichord. Considering the antique sound of the harpsichord and the heroic sound of the horn, I looked to medieval literature for inspiration.  \r\n\r\n"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" is an anonymous masterwork of 14th-century England.  I love this tale and have read it many times.  Not in the original Middle English; only scholars can do that.  I''ve read several translations and for my money the best is J.R.R. Tolkien''s; it''s funny, spooky, mystical.  Reading it, I felt the presence of a master storyteller, wise and wry.\r\n\r\nI thought, "What if there was a film version of this exciting, ambiguous, lovely story?  What would a suitable film score sound like?"  I set to work, devising five movements that could underscore the major scenes of the tale.\r\n	\r\nThe third movement depicts the heroic knight, Sir Gawain, riding merrily through a gloomy, medieval landscape.  It''s entitled "Gawain''s Journey."\r\n\r\nHere''s Tolkien''s rendering of that scene:\r\n\r\nBy a mount in the morning merrily he was riding\r\ninto a forest that was deep and fearsomely wild,\r\nwith high hills at each hand, and hoar woods beneath\r\nof huge aged oaks by the hundred together ....\r\n\r\nSo many a marvel in the mountains he met in those lands\r\nthat ''twould be tedious the tenth part to tell you thereof.\r\nAt whiles with worms he wars, and with wolves also,\r\nat whiles with wood-trolls that wandered in the crags,\r\nand with bulls and with bears and boars, too, at times;\r\nand with ogres that hounded him from the heights of the fells.\r\nHad he not been stalwart and staunch and steadfast in God,\r\nhe doubtless would have died and death had met often.\r\n\r\nBill Huggins and his friends played the piece enthusiastically but it was never performed by anyone else because the combination of instruments was so unusual.  In 2011, I revised and re-scored the piece for piano trio plus trumpet, an ensemble much easier to assemble.\r\n\r\nTo hear Gawain’s Journey performed wit and gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSept. 7, 2014\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),64);

After moving here in 1994 (so that our two children could attend the city''s celebrated School for the Creative and Performing Arts), I was shocked to find that when I mentioned ‘The Lake,’ people asked me, "What lake?"\r\n\r\nWhat lake?  Were they kidding?  To a northern Ohioan there is only one lake.  ‘The Lake.’  Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nHere in Cincinnati it''s ‘The River.’  The Ohio River.  If Cincinnatians mentioned ‘the river’ and I asked, "What river?" they would think I was kidding.\r\n\r\nSeveral generations of Sowashes passed many happy summers on the shores of Lake Erie, in Lakeside, a Chautauqua resort near Sandusky.  For a while, our family even had a cottage there and a small sailboat in which I ventured to Kelly''s Island and elsewhere, exploring the waters where Oliver Hazard Perry defeated the British Navy at the Battle of Lake Erie.  To this day, northern Ohioans take pride in that victory, which proved a much-needed morale-booster for our side in the War of 1812. \r\n\r\nOnce, strange to tell, on a very windy day, sailing with my ten-year-old nephew, our little craft floundered.  Despite a hard-blowing wind, we were just bobbing around, not going anywhere. How could that be?  \r\n\r\nI looked around.   Was there something wrong with the rudder?  the keel?  No.  Looking up, I discovered the problem:  the sail had come loose from the top of the mast.  I could not climb the mast to repair it.  We were a long way from shore.  There was only one thing to do.  \r\n\r\nWe slid into the water and dog-paddled, buoyed by our life-jackets, tugging behind us a rope attached to the sailboat.  At length we landed on one of the many tiny, unnamed islands in the waters rendered glorious by O.H. Perry.  We beached our boat, shipwrecked on a desert island!  We tipped the boat on its side and used our shoelaces to fasten the sail back onto the mast and then sailed back to Lakeside in triumph, with a story to tell!  My nephew was beaming with joy!  He''d had a real adventure!\r\n\r\nEven now and then, here in Cincinnati, in this humid valley carved by ‘The River’ so long ago, I step outside to find that the wind is brisk and fast, the air dry and clear.

One was a chronicle of China''s 5,000 years squeezed into a book of manageable length; I figured it would require six or seven hours to read.\r\n\r\nThe other, Stephen Mitchell''s translation of Lao Tzu''s Tao Te Ching, one of the world''s great scriptures, the fundamental, indispensable classic of Chinese thought, is only 5,000 words long. I flipped through it for a few seconds.  It offers 81 terse thoughts.  All short, some very.  I thought I''d give it a half an hour or so and then turn to the history book.\r\n\r\nWas I wrong!  Hours passed and I was only half-way through the Tao Te Ching.\r\n\r\nDuring those 17 hours in flight, I did manage to read both books.  I passed about six hours reading the book of Chinese history, as anticipated.  But I must have passed twice as much time reading the Tao Te Ching.  \r\n\r\nOr not reading, exactly.  Pondering would be a better word.  Each of the 81 thoughts compels thinking -- long, deep, careful thinking.  I read one and found myself gazing out the window, thinking hard about it for twenty minutes before turning to the next.  \r\n\r\nThis ambiguous little book, written 600 years before Jesus, seemed to address the most pressing particulars of my life at that time; in all the years since, it has often helped me to think about whatever is going on in my life, in my family, in our country or in the world.\r\n\r\nI kept a slim copy in my pocket when I was working as a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum.  On snowy days or late summer afternoons when the galleries are empty, I would read a few pages, pondering them anew.  I especially loved to peruse it when I was guarding the Asian galleries.  \r\n\r\nHere are a few of the many lines I''ve pondered, long and hard:\r\n\r\nHe who has power over others\r\ncan''t empower himself.     (Oh?  Why is that?)\r\n\r\nIf you realize that you have enough,\r\nyou are truly rich.     (Ah, but how much is enough?  how rich is truly rich?)\r\n\r\nThe more he [the Master] gives to others,\r\nthe wealthier he is.     (wealthier in what sense?)\r\n\r\nSuccess or failure: which is more dangerous?     (what dangers come to mind?)\r\n\r\nGive evil nothing to oppose\r\nand it will disappear by itself.     (what about Hitler?  Stalin? would Gandhi agree?)\r\n\r\nCare about people''s approval\r\nand you will be their prisoner.     (how exactly?  what about approval of family, friends?)\r\n\r\nDo your work.  Then step back.\r\nThe only path to serenity.     (a day''s work?  a life''s work?  why is it the only path?)\r\n\r\nInevitably, I started setting to music thoughts from the Tao Te Ching.  One of these was #12. Here it is:  \r\n\r\nColors blind the eye.\r\nSounds deafen the ear.\r\nFlavors numb the taste.\r\nThoughts weaken the mind.\r\nDesires wither the heart.\r\n\r\nThe Master observes the world\r\nbut trusts his inner vision.\r\nHe allows things to come and go.\r\nHis heart is open as the sky.\r\n\r\nOne can think for a long, long time about these words.  Is it a caution against hedonism?  Are we being warned not to be led and shaped only by our senses, thoughts, desires?  We’re told to trust our inner vision, to let things come and go and become as open as the sky.  What does this mean, practically?\r\n\r\nBut look again!  We''re not told to do anything.  We''re simply told what the Master does and that the Master''s heart is open.  Are we to do likewise?  Do we want to be a Master?  A Master of what, exactly?  Hearts open to what, precisely?  \r\n\r\nThink!  Think!  Think!  \r\n\r\nSee what I mean?\r\n\r\nI''d love to share much more about this remarkable little book ... it offers profound advice for artists ... it offers counsel about governance of self, family, nation ... it explores the idea of ''action through non-action'' ... it speaks about personal finances ... it offers glimpses into mystical experience ... and there is humor in the book as well! ... but I’ve already gone on too long.

The absence of a bass instrument and the subject of breakfast called for a light, supple music.  Music that is sprightly, nimble, delightful.\r\n\r\nFrench Toast is not French (in France, they call it pain perdu which means “lost bread,” i.e., stale bread, because French toast is always better if the bread you’re using is stale). but including that entrée in this suite gave me an excuse to write music that would sound French, music influenced by those charming French composers:  Ibert, Francaix and Poulenc.\r\n\r\nThe influence is legitimate because I am the descendent of French immigrants.  My French Huguenot ancestors arrived in Boston in 1737.  Paul Revere and Davy Crockett were also descended from Huguenots.

That’s the “Honey” music, a ‘honey’ of a tune.   \r\n\r\nNext come the English muffins.  At 1:55 the meter changes to 6/8 and the musical style turns English.  We hear a country jig in the manner of Ralph Vaughan Williams (a British composer whose work I admire).\r\n\r\nThe music jigs happily along, moving in and out of various keys, major and minor.\r\n\r\nThen, at 6:30 the “Honey” music returns and is heard simultaneously with the English jig.  Both tunes are sounded at once as the honey is poured onto the muffin.\r\n\r\nVoilà!

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(37,replace(replace('Odell Shepard’s The Harvest of a Quiet Eye is a tapestry of essays and poems recounting a walking journey the author made through rural Connecticut in September of 1926.  An engaging minor classic of the literature of walking, the book brims with good, sweet things:  a deep affection for small towns and little rivers, an appreciation of solitude alternating with vivid character sketches and an abundance of gently humorous, pleasantly self-indulgent digressions into many other subjects.  The book is imbued with optimism and serenity.  \r\n\r\nIt''s a book I love and have read many, many times.  For years, I''ve purchased first editions of the book to give to friends.  The first edition is beautiful, printed in dark green ink on rich, creamy vellum and with broad margins.  Over a hundred illustrations.  The book even smells good!  No one is producing books like that, nowadays.\r\n\r\nShepard wrote in a way that suggests an alternative 20th century, the quiet, pastoral 20th century that might have been had we been able to dodge two world wars, the Great Depression, Cold War tensions, the strains of prolonged nuclear threat, overpopulation and the ravaging of the environment.  Shepard kept his art clean of angst and alienation. He walked and wrote in an America as refreshingly remote from our own as Oz or Middle Earth.\r\n\r\nYet he is no fantasist; he roots his appreciation for the beauty of life in a full acceptance of its transience.  \r\n \r\nWho was he?  Odell Shepard (1884-1967) was a professor of English literature at Trinity College, a newspaper columnist, a pianist and singer, an indefatigable walker and trout fisherman, and even, for one term, lieutenant governor of Connecticut!  Shepard wrote well on an astonishingly diverse array of topics and in nearly every literary form.  His biography of Bronson Alcott won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize.  His novels Jenkins’ Ear, and Holdfast Gaines, co-authored with his son, were successful Book-of-the-Month Club selection.  Books on Connecticut history, Shakespeare, and trout-fishing as well as essays, poems, newspaper columns and editings of other writers whose work he admired poured from his pen in the 1920’s and ‘30’s.  Two of his books, The Heart of Thoreau''s Journals and his masterful study of the unicorn myth, The Lore of the Unicorn, have never gone out of print.\r\n\r\nRhapsodizing in prose, his writing is strikingly good, quietly dignified yet impassioned, a noble, flowing, musical prose that aspires to poetry.  If this was music, we''d describe it as tonal and melodic.	\r\n\r\nI''ve set to music several of his poems and in 2010 I wrote my only extended dramatic work, adapting Shepard''s account, in The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, of his encounter with a grim marsh-land, "livid with Death."  He dares to try to hear what the Marsh is "saying" to him; she asserts Nature''s indifference to our brief human experiment with consciousness.  It nearly undoes him. A message like that, if we really take it in, can just about undo any of us.  \r\n\r\nThen, rejoicing in the beauty of the dying leaves of autumn, he affirms Life all the more heartily and strides "with high-hearted singing" to the end of his day''s hike, crossing the bridge and seeing the light of his inn "at the far end shining."  I take the bridge as a metaphor for our journeys’ end in Death and the inn, with its shining lights, as a metaphor of a welcoming, restful afterlife.\r\n\r\nMy cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye is in twelve-movements, scored for baritone (who sings the role of Shepard, the hiker-narrator), soprano (who sings the words of the Marsh-land), chorus (who comments on the action), four-part chorus and a miniature orchestra consisting of a flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nJust now I want to share the last two movements:  the baritone solo in which Shepard so beautifully comes to terms with Death, followed by the Finale for baritone, chorus and instruments when he finishes his hike, crossing the bridge at last.\r\n\r\nHere are the words:\r\n\r\nMovement #11:  It is true that I am walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death and that soon I shall lie down there, never to rise, and that every flower and face and thought that I have known, together with all that my fellows have thought and dreamed and made, will lie there very soon beside me.  But yet it is a most beautiful valley and I have always loved it and I love it more deeply at every step that brings me nearer the end. Why then should I grieve to lie here forever?  The oak and the maple are dying too and they comfort me.  For they do not dwindle and pine into the grave but go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas as though they have some expectation of joy, some intuition that from this dying world unimaginable life may spring as the new year springs from the ruins of the old.  In such company at least I can say that I will fear no evil.\r\n\r\nMovement #12:  The sun was setting behind the mountains and a breeze awoke in the sky.  The new moon was blown bare of clouds and the stars shown round her like a shining wreath.  By her pale illumination I found my way.  I strode along with high-hearted singing until at last I could see the bridge and finally the light of my inn at the far end shining.\r\n\r\nThat ending touches my heart; when I hear this music my throat tightens, tears come.  I want to raise a hand and wave goodbye to this good man as he crosses over.  I may ask my choir director friend, Chris Miller, to sing and lead these two movements at my funeral.\r\n\r\nTo hear the last two movements of The Harvest Quiet Eye, in the premiere performance by the superb baritone Noel Bouley with the Cincinnati Camerata under the direction of Chris Miller, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 12, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“The Harvest of a Quiet Eye” is the name of one of my favorite books and also the name of my only extended work for soloists and chorus.  The author of this book, Odell Shepard, borrowed the title from a poem by Wordsworth:\r\n\r\nThe outward shows of sky and earth,\r\nOf hill and valley he has viewed;\r\nAnd impulses of deeper birth \r\nHave come to him in solitude.\r\n\r\nIn common things that round us lie\r\nSome random truths he can impart, --\r\nThe harvest of a quiet eye \r\nThat broods and sleeps on his own heart.\r\n\r\nMy cantata opens with a choral setting of those noble words.  What follows are settings of Shepard''s account of his encounter with a grim Marsh-land, "livid with Death."  He dares to try to hear what the Marsh is "saying" to him; she asserts Nature''s indifference to our brief human experiment and it nearly undoes him.  A message like that, if we really take it in, leads to despair.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, surprised, he finds himself remembering the “brave, high-hearted songs” his fellow human beings have sung and he rejoices in that memory and in the beauty of the dying autumn leaves that “go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas."

Auburn Presbyterian Church choir in which I have the pleasure of singing.  He is also a fine baritone, pianist, guitarist and trumpeter.  In 2007, he asked me to write something “American-sounding” for trumpet and piano that he could play as an offertory.\r\n\r\nWhat is more American-sounding than Richard Rodgers’ score for “Oklahoma!”?  The show opens with the cowboy Curly singing, “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’.”  I decided to meet Chris’ request by paying homage to Richard Rodgers and to that song in particular.  \r\n\r\nMy piece begins and ends with Curly doing his cowboy thing.  I picture him strutting along, thumbs in his belt, cowboy hat tilted back on his head, whistling at the girls and smiling broadly.  But Curly has a reverential side, too.  Night falls and the music calms down.  Gazing up in wonder and gratitude at the stars above the prairie, Curly is moved to pray a prayer of Thanksgiving.  You’ll hear it.  And when the prayer is concluded, you’ll hear Curly  dust himself off and resume his strut and head into town, looking for fun.\r\n\r\nIn the score, I ask the trumpeter to wear a cowboy hat for the opening and final sections of the piece, but to remove it for the prayerful middle section.\r\n\r\nListen carefully and you’ll hear “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” peeking around the corners as the trumpet and piano weave fragments of the famous tune into the texture of the piece.  The entire opening phrase of the song is only heard once, at the very end.\r\n\r\nEven without being told in advance that a well-known tune was being quoted, I think you’d probably sense that there was something familiar about what you were hearing.  But I think you would be unable to identify it until the very end.  Then you’d say, “Ah-HAH!  So THAT’s why I thought I recognized something!"\r\n\r\nThe piece has never been recorded in its original trumpet/piano version.  In fact, hardly anyone has ever heard this music.  Chris played it in church once or twice but through the miracle of technology, today’s email miraculously, serves it up for the first time to you and many other friends and fans.   \r\n\r\nWhat times we live in, when such miracles are possible for people of modest means, like me.  When I think of this, I feel prompted, like Curly, to pray prayers of Thanksgiving.  Thirty years ago, the only way I could have shared this music with you would have been to produce an LP and mail it to you.  The cost would have been enormous and prohibitive.

I had booked him to perform at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, Ohio, my home town.  \r\n\r\nA Grand Baroque movie palace, built to last forever in 1925, “The Ren" was slated for demolition just five and half decades later.   A handful of Mansfielders resolved to save the theatre, inspired others to join them, hired me to lead the effort, raised money and restored it beautifully.  Ninety years old now, this historic theatre is an enduring source of pride for Mansfield.\r\n\r\nI booked and met many performers during the six years I served as Director of Renaissance, Inc.  Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Itzahk Perlman, “Alabama,” Mitzi Gaynor, Bob Hope.  It was a heady time and I was especially excited to be hosting Cab Calloway.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, my mom often played LP recordings of Cab singing his greatest hits. My brothers and I sang and danced along with her; we knew the all words.  \r\n\r\nI was very eager to meet him.  An hour before showtime he had not arrived and I was nervous.  A half hour before showtime, my stage manager, shaking his head, informed me that Mr. Calloway was in the dressing room.  Something was wrong.  I went backstage.\r\n\r\nHe was in his dressing room, yes, but he looked to be a hundred years old.  He was slumped in his chair, a very old, very tired black man in a sleeveless undershirt, staring at his knees.  I said hello.  He raised one hand in a half-wave but hardly looked up.  I told him I was a fan and that we were really looking forward to his show.  He grunted.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to say so I joined my wife in the audience.  “Hoo boy,” I told her.  “I don’t know about this.”\r\n\r\nAt length the lights went down, the band played the introduction to one of his songs, the spotlight beamed a bright circle on stage right … and we waited.  Suddenly, he came strutting out, head high, shoulders back, flashing his famous, toothy, million-dollar smile, sporting a magnificent, powder-blue tuxedo.  The Hi-Dee-Ho Man had arrived!  \r\n\r\nFor two hours, he wowed the audience, singing, dancing, telling jokes and stories and getting us all to sway our hands with him, echoing his “Hi-dee-ho’s” right on cue.\r\n\r\nStanding ovation.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he made his way up the aisle of the empty theatre to my office. He was standing tall, his tux in a clothes bag over his shoulder.  I paid him the balance of his fee, just as his contract had specified:  twenty-five one-hundred dollar bills.  He took out his wallet and it was as thick as a triple cheeseburger, stuffed with hundred-dollar bills.  He must have been carrying $40,000 in that wallet.  Cash.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of his carrying that amount of cash on the streets of downtown Mansfield being none of my business, I just told him how much we had all loved the show.  \r\n\r\nThen I added, “I have to tell you that you had me pretty worried when I saw you in your dressing room before the show.”  He asked me why.  “Well, you just seemed really tired and I didn’t know what to expect.”  \r\n\r\nHe laughed and said, “Ma-a-a-an, you got to learn to re-LAX!”  I laughed too and thanked him again.  We shook hands.  I watched him shuffle out the front door of the theatre and across Park Avenue West to the Travel Lodge.  A legendary figure of the Harlem Renaissance, a great performer, an artist who knew when to relax and when to expend his energy, he was also, at that moment, a solitary, elderly black man on the streets of downtown Mansfield, late at night, with $40,000 in his wallet.  I kept an eye on him from the theatre door until he had safely entered the motel lobby.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, it occurred to me that our church choir at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian here in Cincinnati would have a blast belting out some Cab Calloway-style “hi-dee-hi-dee-ho’s.” I adapted a quotation from G.B. Shaw because it expressed the “bright and shiny” optimism Cab put across so convincingly.  I rewrote Shaw’s words so that they would rhyme and I worked in some “hi-dee-ho’s.”   \r\n\r\nTo hear the Northern Kentucky Community Choir sing "Clean Up!” under the direction of Stephanie Nash, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 15, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),6);

We’ve attended almost every year since 1973 and it never fails to move us to tears.\r\n\r\nSome things are beyond the power of words to express.  I remember thinking, when we were on the island of Kauai, “How will I ever convey the beauty of this place to the folks back in Ohio?”  We can only recount the bare facts of the experience and attach a label to our emotional response.\r\n\r\nThe Boar’s Head Festival is like that.  The facts are:  150 volunteer performers in gorgeous costumes, carrying lovingly crafted props, present a Christmas pageant with the  accompaniment of a large chorus and full orchestra.  The SRO crowd adds their voices to those of the choir as familiar carols alternate with solos sung by the ‘stars’ of the cast.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Revels opens with the majestic “Boar’s Head Carol,” enjoining the attendees to sing along with the chorus.  It’s a joyful tune with joyful words, yet I weep all through it, as I do pretty much throughout the whole pageant.\r\n\r\nHow shall I label our emotional response?  What is it, exactly, that moves us so powerfully?\r\n\r\nThe Boar’s Head Festival demonstrates what humanity can achieve when we are at our best.  Responding to the beauty of it, the humor, the majesty, the heartfelt reverence, cast and audience alike are brought to an awareness of our common humanity.  We feel that, despite all the hideousness, the cruelty, the greed, the terror we humans inflict, there is something wonderful about us after all, something that redeems us.\r\n\r\nWhy is this moving?  We are each profoundly different from the rest.  We arrive at every present moment by way of distinct and separate paths, long and winding paths that have led us all through deep shadows and sunny glens.  It is miraculous that we can communicate with one another at all.\r\n\r\nWhen, as part of an audience, we are moved by a shared experience, the awareness of our differences seems to drop away for a little while, our solitude is relieved.  The tears we weep are tears of joy, relief and solace.\r\n\r\nMy little set of variations on The Boar’s Head Carol is a light and humble work, scored for just three musicians.  It falls far short of the splendor of the Boar’s Head Festival that inspired it.  Yet it is my sincere homage to the good people of Christ Church Cathedral, my expression of gratitude for the joy they have brought their audiences every Christmas since 1940.\r\n\r\nThis seems an appropriate moment to quote the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.  He said, “There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers.”\r\n\r\nPlease accept this piece as my sincere attempt to bring you joy.\r\n\r\nTo hear Variations on The Boar’s Head Carol splendidly performed by the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 20, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),159);

The road rises, then very considerately levels off, then rises again, then goes level again.  A thoughtful road, a humane road, a civilized road!   \r\n\r\nAt length the slow climb is rewarded with a long, leisurely descent through lovely Macedonia Brook State Park.  Dense pine forests, a wealth of ferns, quaint little log bridges across the brook, campers happily rustling up breakfast, an occasional whiff of frying bacon on the breeze.  Paradise!\r\n\r\nIt was my first ride wearing my new helmet.  Black with gray trim, very handsome, contrasting quite nicely, I’ve been told, with my white beard and mustache.  I always wear black shorts when I bike.  Usually I wear dark purple woolen socks, but those were wet in the washer so I had put on my black socks.  As it happened, I had pulled on a black t-shirt.  \r\n\r\nAs I crossed the Housatonic, I suddenly realized that I was all in black.  Like Zorro.  Like hunky young Marlon Brando in his motorcycle jacket.  Like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in "Men in Black.”  Like “V,” the shadowy opponent of oppression in “V for Vendetta."\r\n\r\nCool.  Who would I be?  “The Black Bikesman.”  That’s who!\r\n\r\nThus, it was with a ‘certain air of savoir faire’ that I pulled into Kent, pleasantly conscious that I "cut a figure."  Not only was I lookin’ good, but I had just completed a vigorous, healthful ride of about 17 miles over the mountain, a stunt not every 60-something can pull off.\r\n\r\nFather’s Day.  With my kids far away, my daughter in Washington DC, my son back in Cincinnati, I decided to treat myself.   I locked my bike to a tree and made for the nearest sidewalk cafe, crowded with interesting-looking people, New Yorkers weekending in Connecticut.  After a bit, I secured coffee and a raisin-oatmeal cookie.  As I exited through the crowd, a young man said, "Excuse me, sir.  I thought you might like to know that your t-shirt is inside-out."\r\n\r\nI thanked him, though I would have preferred to have remained ignorant.  I chose a chair among the sidewalk tables that would allow me to sit with my back to the wall, hoping no one else would notice the big white t-shirt tag on the nape of my neck.  I dunked my cookie and drank my coffee, my enjoyment somewhat compromised.\r\n\r\nFinally, I got up, tossed my paper cup in the trashcan and hit the sidewalks.  I felt the eyes of my fellow pedestrians behind me.  “Pathetic old guy,” they’d be thinking.  “Can’t even put on his t-shirt correctly anymore.”  \r\n\r\nI had to get my t-shirt right-side-out.  The question was where to do it.  I didn''t want to strip off my t-shirt and present myself bare-chested, however briefly, on a crowded sidewalk.  Connecticut was settled by Puritans and their influence lingers yet in the state’s “Blue Laws.”  For all I knew, going shirtless on a public sidewalk in Connecticut could be a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThere are many shops in Kent, mostly in houses that were formerly homes.  I made my way to the backyard of one of these and went behind a big, old maple tree.  I looked around, to be sure that I was unobserved.  That was when I noticed a woman staring at me from inside.  She rapped her knuckles on the window, wagging her forefinger, shaking her head, frowning.   She had obviously formed the notion that I was about to relieve myself on her tree.\r\n\r\nAt a loss as to how to convey to her my actual intention by pantomiming, I returned to the sidewalk, trying to think what to do.\r\n\r\nI went into a classy dress shop and asked if I could use a dressing room.  "I just need to take off my shirt and then put it right back on," I explained to the clerk.  This gave her pause.  It must have come across as a facile fib, cloaking darker intentions.  She gave me a long look and then said that dressing rooms were for customers only and directed me to the public restrooms, several blocks away.\r\n\r\nI headed that direction.  The sidewalks were crowded with families, couples young and old, attractive women of all ages and many men, all of whom had managed to don their t-shirts right side out.  I could imagine a young mother observing me closely from behind and telling her children, "This is why you must be alert, pay attention and do well in school -- so that, when you are old, you don''t end up walking around in public with your t-shirt inside out." \r\n\r\nWhen I got to the public restroom, there was another man in there, standing, making appropriate use of the facility.  Somehow I didn''t want to take off my shirt while he was there.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had no other reason for being in the restroom and it is not a place for lingering.  So, just to be doing something, I washed my hands.  Soon, he was at the sink next to mine, washing his hands, too.  “Your t-shirt’s inside-out," he observed.  \r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," I said.  "That''s the way they''re wearing them now.  It''s like wearing your base-ball cap backwards.  It makes a statement."\r\n\r\nI caught his face at an angle, in the mirror.  He rolled his eyes, sighed, and left without another word.  \r\n\r\nFinally alone and out of sight of my public, I quickly yanked my t-shirt off, turned it right-side-out and pulled it back on.\r\n\r\nMy confidence regained, I went outside.  \r\n\r\nThe Black Bikesman was back.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer play the second movement from my Father’s Day Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 19, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),38);

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(47,replace(replace('Looking back with a sigh, Jo and I agree that the happiest period of our lives were the eight years we lived in tiny Gambier, Ohio, seat of Kenyon College.  We lived there from 1986 to 1994, inhabiting a charming, 19th-century home with fireplaces, cozy low ceilings, wormy chestnut beams, exposed brick walls, old windows with wavy glass and little bubbles in the panes.  We were surrounded by hardwood forest on three sides and our two-thirds of an acre boasted no less than forty mighty oak trees.  \r\n\r\nEvery spring the yard burst forth in, truly, about 10,000 daffodils.  Previous owners had planted them but we dug up the bulbs, busted them apart and replanted them so that they spread and spread, more each year.  The results were amazing.  The yard looked like a movie set or the cover of a bulb-seller’s mail-order brochure.  Villagers walked past our house, just to see the display of daffodils.  \r\n\r\nBest of all, our kids were little and, every moment of every day, we felt that we were, not just a couple, but a family living together.\r\n\r\nOur next door neighbor was Susan Browning, a devoted amateur clarinetist and a passionate dog-lover.  Sometimes she called to ask if our noble Springer spaniel, whom we had named “Binsche,” would like to come along with Trim, her stately, beautiful collie, for an ice cream cone treat.  The dogs would pile into Susan''s car and we’d watch as Susan backed out of our driveway, the dogs’ heads already sticking out the partially rolled-down back windows, tongues out, ears flapping in the wind.  When the three of them returned, Susan would very seriously assure us that “the boys” had enjoyed their ice cream, as if we had doubted if such would be case and were in need of assurance.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Susan commissioned me to write a suite for unaccompanied clarinet.  She did not want a virtuoso concert work, just a set of fun, short pieces that she could play at home for her own amusement. \r\n\r\nI wrote twelve little pieces for her, collectively entitled, “A College Town Diary: 12 Months in Gambier.”\r\n\r\nThe piece is a “diary,” i.e., a private journal of thoughts, sentiments and sarcasms, carefully recorded but not necessarily intended for public scrutiny.  Being a “diary,” the piece is personal, opinionated and a little eccentric … like Susan … like myself.\r\n\r\nTwelve movements — even short movements — would make a long haul for a clarinetist performing unaccompanied in front of an audience.  Now and then clarinetists have fashioned a handful of the movements into short suites, more suitable for concert use.  That’s fine with me.  A few years ago, I devised a “Suite from A College Town Diary,” arranging six of the movements for clarinet and piano.\r\n\r\n(By the way, I’ll gladly send PDFs of these scores — free — to any of you who are interested.  Just ask.)\r\n\r\nThese days, Jo and I live in the historic heart of Cincinnati, a city with much to admire culturally, scenically, historically and some things to deplore, such as the nation''s second-highest rates of homelessness, hunger and poverty.  \r\n\r\nWe moved here for the educational opportunities the city offered our children.  After they graduated from Cincinnati’s celebrated School for the Creative & Performing Arts and left home, Jo and I stayed on in Cincinnati.  We wouldn’t be as happy in Gambier now, not without our little kids living at home with us.  And we’ve changed, too;  a tiny Ohio college town, surrounded by woods and cornfields, would feel too small for us now.\r\n\r\nThat difference is particularly felt during the month of March.  March is no treat in an Ohio city but in rural Ohio, March is bleak, almost unbearable.  Muddy, cold, gray and no holidays, except when Easter comes early.  St. Patrick’s Day doesn’t amount to much in a rural Ohio village.  Cincinnati’s Bockfest and March Madness are unknown in the Buckeye hinterland.\r\n\r\nOr rather, in a college town, there are no March holidays for the Townies.  For the students and faculty, there’s Spring Break!  They get to leave!  It’s the one joyous thing about March!  Off they go, to warmer places where they will, you may be assured, like Binsche and Trim, enjoy their ice cream.  Thus, my “March” movement is joyful after all!   And less than 90 seconds long.\r\n\r\n(The music for the “March” movement is not a march, by the way.  More like a leaping-and-bounding dance.  I reserved the notion of writing a march for the “July” movement, to evoke Gambier’s delightful Fourth of July parade.)\r\n\r\nTo hear Bill Perconti play “March” from A College Town Diary:  Twelve Months in Gambier on the alto saxophone, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 6, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),161);

It’s an attractive notion; it''s brought me exhilaration and relief.  It liberates the religious impulse from intellectual tedium.  A person is religious, not because they’ve convinced themselves that they can prove the existence of a Deity or because they’ve somehow reconciled the idea of a loving God with the fact of Evil.  No. Being religious is simply in their DNA.  \r\n\r\nMetaphysics interested me when I was a teenager.  I had a dim idea that Great Minds wrestled with such things and that, if I were to have a Great Mind, I was obliged to join in.  You are older now than I was then; you know what follows:  feverish disputation, resentment and alienation.  These might be endured if there was any hope of a rational resolution to the Great Questions, but eventually I concluded that there was no such hope and grew weary of the whole business.  I set it all aside and found, to my surprise, that I remained quite religious, regardless of the irrationality of it.  I have been at peace with my own appetite for religion, ever since.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t need to make sense.  If it’s absurd, fine.  I inherited the religious gene, apparently, along with brown eyes, musical ability and a bundle of other traits.  And that’s that.  I couldn’t be non-religious any more than I could change my eye-color to blue or turn tone-deaf.  It’s who I am.\r\n\r\nMy dear wife, my partner and best friend, the love of my life for nearly 50 years, hasn’t the slightest appetite for religion.  It does not run in her family.  I go to church every Sunday.  Jo stays home, watching “Meet the Press.”   I pray and ponder, many times, every day.  If Jo prays or ponders the Will of God, she has never made it known to me.  \r\n\r\nOur daughter seems to have inherited the gene from my side, while our son is like his Mama, non-religious.  Happily, the non-religious half of our little family gets along just fine with the religious half.  It’s no big deal.  We like each other and religion rarely comes up.  When it does, we’re respectful.  We tilt our heads and listen thoughtfully. When I give thanks before a family meal, all four heads are bowed.  We have lots of other things to talk about and most of them are more fun than religion.\r\n\r\nI’ve written quite a lot of sacred choral music, ie., music intended to be sung in worship services.  Religious feeling sometimes finds its way into my instrumental works as well.\r\n\r\nToday being Easter, I’m inviting you to listen to the second movement of my Sonata for cello and piano, entitled “Largo Religioso.”  I think you will like it, whatever your DNA, “religiously-wise-speaking” (as the great musical humorist Peter Schickele would say). You don’t need to have inherited the religious gene to enjoy this music.  I know that’s so because my Jo loves this recording!\r\n\r\nJo, and shortly you, are among the very few who have heard this music.  I wrote the sonata in 1990 for my cellist friend and mentor Terry King but it has rarely been performed.  I have never heard it performed live.  It has only recently been recorded and will be featured on a CD of cello works which I hope to issue next year.\r\n\r\nTo hear my friends — cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Sam Black — playing “Largo Religioso,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 27, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),78);

He performed with “les Gavottes”, the Riviera-based trio that recorded my first three trios for clarinet, cello and piano, written specifically for the group. \r\n\r\nI sent Jean my works for solo keyboard, including “Pensée," the earliest piece of my music which I still value, written in 1968, when I was 18 years old.  \r\n\r\nToday, what is surprises me about this little piece is the extent to which it shows that I was already so completely myself when I wrote it.  When you listen, I think you’ll agree.  You’ll think, “Yes, this sounds like something R.S. would write."\r\n\r\nMy high school music teachers taught me 90% of what I needed to know about music in order to do my life’s work.  During my college years I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a middle ground between who I really was, musically, and the composer the faculty at the illustrious School of Music I attended seemed to want me to be.  The implication was that if I didn’t cave in and write avant garde music, I could not have a career.  But I was not cut out to be an avant garde composer.  Musically, I was always a Conservative.  “Derrière garde,” yes.  Avant garde, no.\r\n\r\nHappily, after graduating, I recovered my authentic voice.   \r\n\r\nI named this piece “Pensée” because it means “a thought” in French.  This is humorous because, at that time, my relationship with the French language had been a disaster.  At the time I wrote the piece, I had had one year of high school French and had bombed badly, earning the only “D” of my academic career.  I was too busy writing music and fiction to bother learning French.\r\n\r\nAll the same, teenager that I was, I thought the title “Pensée” would sound intelligent, worldly and high-falutin’.  When I was 18 I never dreamed I would soon return to studying French again — with seriousness this time -- let alone that I would someday  teach French (as I have been doing very happily for the past two years).\r\n\r\nYet the title is apt.  This IS a thoughtful piece.  Especially the way Jean Tatu plays it.  His rendering is tender and simple.   I love to watch him play in the Youtube he kindly sent me, especially the way he lifts his hands from the keyboard after sounding the last chord.  It reminds me that music-making is a thing we can relish visually as well as aurally.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(50,replace(replace('Our son, Chapman, 31, is my favorite guy.  On his Facebook page, he advises his friends:  “Be an interesting Cincinnatian” and he practices what he preaches.  An extraordinarily versatile trombonist, he has made numerous tours of America and Europe with a variety of bands.  Here in Cincinnati, he’s the co-founder of the Hot Magnolias, the Queen City’s chief exponent of traditional New Orleans jazz.  But he also plays with several other bands, ''local and beyond,’ in styles ranging through reggae, ska, rockabilly, Dixieland, soul and funk.  He’s making his fourth European tour next month as a guest trombonist with The Toasters, a famous ska band.\r\n\r\nHe’s written only a few songs, but they are strong.  The Blues song he wrote and played at my mother-in-law’s funeral brought tears to our eyes.  His ska tune is entitled “Higher Ground” and was recorded by another band he helped to found, The Pinstripes.  I liked the opening tune of “Higher Ground" so much that I made it the recurring theme in the joyful, exuberant "Finale" movement of my cello concerto.  I want to share that movement with you today.\r\n\r\nAt the website linked above, you’ll hear Chap''s tune immediately, catchy and compelling, played by the brass.  Take in at least the first thirty seconds so that when you listen to the “Finale" concerto movement, posted below, you’ll see how it was adapted.  Click on the link to hear The Pinstripes playing Chap’s tune, “Higher Ground.”\r\n\r\nSince the tune is the style of ska, the tempo of the “Finale" movement of my concerto is indicated as "Tempo di ska.”  The opening three measures establish the beat, the key and the feel.  Then the solo cello renders Chap’s tune, somewhat as you heard it in “Higher Ground.”  The same, yet not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, right quick, the clarinet plays tune as a trickster might, ornamented and sassy, an octave higher than the cello you just heard and with jazz and Klezmer inflections.\r\n\r\nThus, the clarinet immediately establishes itself as a rival to the cello.  It’s a theatrical device.  Sometimes the clarinet steals the spotlight from the solo cello.  At other times the clarinet supports the cello’s solo role.  At still other times the clarinet retreats, a pale color amid the strings.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a metaphor.  The clarinet is the piece’s only wind instrument and the only black instrument in the ensemble.  All the other instruments are the color of varnished wood.  The clarinet is the outsider — or is he?  It’s as if the clarinet is the black man in a white society or a Jew in Christendom.  What is the difference between merely being present and truly belonging?  What does it mean to belong?  Having one’s contributions accepted and appreciated by the majority?\r\n\r\nConsider that ska was created by Jamaicans, jazz and the blues by African-Americans and Klezmer by Jews.  And here is our clarinet friend, in this concerto, evoking ska, jazz and Klezmer.  See what’s happening?  But, here, in this work, the clarinet is not an outsider, not a “black sheep,” because in this work those ‘outsider’ minority musical traditions are reconciled with classical European traditions. \r\n\r\nHow?  At 2:15 the music abruptly, unexpectedly turns 18th-century, Viennese.  With almost no modulation, there are improbable changes:  to a new key -- G minor — and a new meter -- 6/8.  We’ve visited this world many times before.  It brings images to mind  musicians in frock coats, knee stockings and powdered wigs, a polite and ordered society.  It’s the world of Haydn.   \r\n\r\nWhat happened to Chap’s ska tune?  It’s still there but hidden, played pizzicato in the lower register by the cellos and basses.    \r\n\r\nBut the main action here constitutes an homage to Haydn.  Why Haydn?.  Because he so effectively reconciled humor with nobility and surprise with architectural integrity.   That’s what I’m trying to do in this concerto.  The Haydn-esque section is both an homage and a joke but I don’t think Papa Haydn would be offended;  no one loved a musical joke better than he.\r\n\r\nAbout 3:24 the music picks up speed and starts to cook again.  By 3:41 it’s really goin’ to town and sounds, to me, like a hit song from one of George M. Cohan’s old-fashioned Broadway musicals.\r\n\r\nThe tunes are developed and expanded and at 5:19 comes the movement’s climax, when the cello descends from a high A and lands in the unanticipated key of Eb major. This new key is the extreme opposite of A major, the key in which the movement and the entire concerto are cast.  \r\n\r\nThis brief venture into Eb major reconciles the opposing extremes of the circle of fifths, echoing the reconciliation of musical styles and traditions that is attempted throughout.  The chugging 16th-notes in the strings in this section always prompt me to imagine a little locomotive, flying down the tracks.  For me, this section recalls the fun and silliness of Leroy Anderson’s wonderful little tone poems.  You might call it “The Little Engine Who Could."\r\n\r\nBut the piece doesn’t end there.  The moment for a big cello cadenza is prepared but the cellist abandons the attempt, playing instead a sort of “anti-cadenza.”  Instead of a flashy virtuoso display, the cello simply plays a little figure on the A string with the open D string sounding underneath.  The figure is short and it gets shorter each time the cellist repeats it, gradually releasing the energy that had nearly reached the bursting point; after our little locomotive just about burst its boiler, this "anti-cadenza" gradually lets the pressure escape.\r\n\r\nNow comes one last quiet surprise:  the tenderness of the cello.  Using its delicate middle strings, the cello plays a plagal cadence, like the “Amen” at the end of a hymn, returning at last to the solemn, heartfelt hymnody that began the opening movement, twenty minutes earlier.  The cello affirms:  "Joyfulness can be funny, yes, even rambunctious … but also, at the end of the day, joyfulness comes in response to the Sacred."  \r\n\r\nAll the opposites presented in the work -- opposites of mood, style, key, genre, the clash of the solo cello and his rival, the clarinet -- are reconciled at last and the concerto ends in quiet dignity.\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 24, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),135);

How does a composer know that further tinkering will not improve the piece?\r\n\r\nFascinating questions, the answers to which, including the one I am about to venture, ought to be taken with a grain of salt.  Maybe two. \r\n\r\nBecause … the only experience of Life we have is our own.  Each of us is an island, notwithstanding John Donne’s assertion to the contrary, and we draw our conclusions from what has passed in the tiny island-worlds we inhabit.  We are all Robinson Crusoe; that is why we still read that book, almost 300 years after it was written.  I’ve read it three times.\r\n\r\nVast gulfs separate us.  We are profoundly different from one another.  \r\n\r\nWhen some loud mouth announces that “Deep down we are all the same,” it’s because he wants to sell us something:  a product, a faith, a political allegiance.  How dare such loud mouths presume to know what we are like, deep down?  \r\n\r\nEach of our stories is unique.  The wonder is that we can communicate at all.  Every painting, story and piece of music is a message in a bottle, tossed from another island, washed up on our shore.\r\n\r\nThus, I can only guess how other artists might sense when a work is complete.  \r\n\r\nBut I can tell you authoritatively how I know when my own work is done.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I started, as a boy, “making up stuff” — stories, tunes, ideas — I have partnered with what I can best describe as a voice.  As I worked on creative projects, this voice speaks to me, almost audibly, saying, “Try an F sharp here, delay the punch line there, put in another measure before the climax, add a pinch of dissonance, make it spookier, make it funnier, smooth it out, give that tune to the cello, this part is too obvious, too pat.”  \r\n\r\nI rarely resisted, almost always tried and accepted what was suggested. When I ignored this free advice, the forward momentum of my piece or story would flounder.  The voice reminds me that a piece of music or writing, as it is being newly born, knows where it wants to go.  My task has been to learn to let it go there, to stay out of the way.\r\n\r\nTake these weekly missives you kindly allow me to share.  (Thank you!  I am immensely grateful for the privilege of sharing my life’s work in this way.)  I slap out a rough draft and then re-read and re-write, dozens of times, implementing suggestions from you-know-what.  Yep, that same voice.\r\n\r\nAs I bring to reality a piece of music or writing, the voice makes fewer and fewer suggestions.  When the voice falls silent, when there are no more suggestions, that’s when I know the work is done.  Just now I re-read this message for the last time … and the only peep of advice that came was to add this sentence I am now writing.  \r\n\r\nln my childhood, teens and twenties, I never thought about the source of this voice.  I took it for granted.  In my thirties, reading about Carl Jung’s thoughts on these matters, I began to understand my experience in a new way.\r\n\r\nIn creative work, at least in mine, there is an extra-human influence, coming from outside my conscious mind, to which no suitable name can be given because the old name has been soiled by so much ignoble use.  It is the very thing — that other-, extra-, beyond- thing which I have tentatively termed ‘a voice'' -- with which we partner and work.  And, yes, it is the thing we worship, each in our way, implicitly or devoutly, as suits our tastes. \r\n\r\nI felt a peculiar relief, a curious unclenching, when I found this same thought, beautifully expressed, in Odell Shepard’s thoughtful memoir, The Cabin Down the Glen:\r\n\r\n"There is some Power ... that stands waiting to help, to cheer, and to guide us.  I do not care to name it now, for all names are limitations, but I believe that each of the great worships of the world has been addressed to this Power, has been the rediscovery by some direct and penetrative mind of a truth that all right-living people have always dimly known.  When we work against this Power, we fail.  When we try to work without it, we merely exhaust ourselves.  When we work with it, we succeed and fulfill our destiny."\r\n\r\nWhen I set out to write “Sunny Days,“ my first trio for violin, clarinet and piano, I planned a five-movement work; the third was to be a set of variations on a Belo-Russian folksong.  But as I worked on that movement the voice''s suggestions came in a flood and, though I tried to keep the movement concise, it grew longer and longer.  Soon, it was almost as long as the other four movements combined and still the suggestions kept coming.\r\n\r\nFinally, I accepted the inevitable:  this movement was determined, perhaps predestined, to become a separate work, “an island, entire of itself,” to quote Mr. Donne.  \r\n\r\nSo I cast it loose from “Sunny Days” and let it expand even further until it became my Trio #2 for violin, clarinet and piano, a single 15-minute movement, subtitled, "American Variations on Belo-Russian Folksong.” \r\n\r\nTo hear the Verdehr Trio’s exuberant performance, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 22, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),32);

Consider.  As he painted, outdoors, the river and village just sat there before him, unchanging, in no hurry to be captured in paint. But the skies were always changing, leaving him at liberty to devise whatever sky he wanted to fashion above his quiet river and his sleeping village.  He indulged his fancy and concocted some of the most joyful skies ever seen on canvas, at least by the undersigned.\r\n\r\nThe CAM’s painting by Bazille is mysterious and unfinished, like Bazille himself.  A woman sits on a bench at the edge of a garden; a beckoning path recedes into a surprising depth, suggesting undeveloped potential, an unknowable future, a journey only contemplated, never undertaken.  \r\n\r\nThe woman and the bench are transparent; mere outlines; you can see right through them to the garden behind.  Is the painting unfinished or did Bazille intend to indicate only the outline of the woman?  Is she a ghost?\r\n\r\nBazille’s story doesn’t answer these questions; it certainly enriches them.  A painter of great talent, close friends with Monet, Renoir, Sisley, he was killed at the age of 28, heroically leading a charge in the Franco-Prussian War.  \r\n\r\nWhen he painted that strange garden scene he didn’t know that his life would soon be cut short.  When we look at it today, we cannot help imagining that the beckoning path is emblematic of the future he might have pursued, the potential he might have realized; the ghostly figure is perhaps the partner with whom he might have found a lasting fulfillment.\r\n\r\nFor me, despite the garden''s rich greens and robustly colorful flowers, it’s a sad painting, a lament for all the young talents taken away too soon by War and for the veterans who returned but who had lost their way and were never the same.  My father, for one.  \r\n\r\nThe last movement of my Impressionist Suite #2 for reed trio is entitled “Sisley & Bazille: Joyful Skies and a Lament for the Fallen.”\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear Sisley’s joyful skies right off, the closest I could get, musically, to what Sisley expressed so cheerfully in paint.   Exactly two minutes in, the mood shifts from joyful to sad as I try, beginning at 2:30, to put into notes the sense of loss we feel, standing before a soldier''s grave.\r\n\r\nAt 4:15, we lift our eyes from the grave and there, again, is the sky.  Sisley’s sky.  So happy after all, smiling down on us.

You can listen to music while you are falling asleep but once you’re really asleep, you’re not listening to music anymore!\r\n\r\nWhat other art form does this?  Imagine a poet writing stanzas with the explicit intention of making your eye lids grow heavier and heavier as you read them.  Or a painter wishing to create canvases that elicit somnolence to such an extent that couches, cots and bedsteads must be set up in the galleries where they are exhibited, bedecked with comforters and pillows.  Or a play that deliberately sets out to induce its audience to snore by intermission.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there are boring poems, paintings and plays; none were written with the specific intention of assisting readers, viewers or theatre goers in falling asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen my brothers and I were tiny, grandmother sang us to sleep with a little tune of her own making.  The words were simply, “Doo-lee, doo-lee, doo-lee….” repeated for as long as was needed to dispatch us to the Land of Nod.\r\n\r\nWhen my turn came to sing lullabyes to my own little ones, I sang that tune again, along with “Loch Lomond” and two Shaker folk hymns: “Simple Gifts” and “Love is Little.”\r\n\r\nThe better known lullabyes didn’t serve.  Brahms’ Lullaby is beautiful but it’s a piano piece, not really intended to be sung.  \r\n\r\n“Rock-a-bye Baby” has a lovely tune, but the imagery is troubling.  You don’t think about the lyrics until you are actually singing them to a baby.  If you looked out your kitchen window and saw a neighbor placing an occupied cradle in a treetop, you’d call the police; they would arrest the caregiver on a charge of child endangerment.  Such a stunt would be dangerous on a still day, but the song says that the wind is blowing, or soon will be!   That bough?  It is going to break; the lyrics leave no room for doubt.  The song doesn’t say “if the bough breaks.”  No.  It is quite clear on that point.  It says “when the bough breaks.”  Folks, that cradle is destined to take the plunge.  “Down will come baby, cradle and all.”  This is a lullaby?  Are you kidding me?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the tune belies all this, rendering the images tongue-in-cheek, even dreamlike.  A good tune can do that, working a sea-change on the lyrics.  The treetop seems hazy, like foliage rendered by Monet.  The wind ineffably gentle.  The baby’s predestined descent will take place, we feel assured, in slo-mo, very slo-mo.  Gravity notwithstanding, we know that the baby will be perfectly safe.\r\n \r\nIn 2002, my graphic artist friends Randy and Michelle Wright asked me to write a lullaby for their newborn daughter, Kara.  If you have my CDs, you’ve seen Randy’s work; he designs my CDs and also my books.  \r\n\r\nA lover of the cello, Rand asked that the piece be scored for cello and piano.  Interestingly, a few nights after I received this request, as I was falling asleep, a lullaby-like tune came to me.  It was still in my head the next morning so I used it as the opening melody of the piece.  \r\n\r\nIt’s followed by a contrasting middle section, beginning at 2:40, evoking the sleepy Old South as imagined by Yankees like myself, who have seen "Gone With The Wind” a time or two.   The Antebellum South, when life was slow and easy, at least for the aristocrats, as always.  And sleep was deep.  That’s the fantasy; let us suspend our revisionist impulses for a bit and honor it for what it is:  a fantasy, yes, but a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nRandy and Michelle, with little Kara in tow, were present when the piece was premiered.  She crooned and chortled as the piece was played before an otherwise silent audience.  Her contribution was the perfect, non-musical touch and the audience loved it.\r\n\r\nTo hear cellist Jeff Schoyen and pianist Phil Amalong perform "Lullabye for Kara,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 4, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),84);

Five years after my high school graduation, I married her daughter, after which Mrs. Ackerman became the best (and only) mother-in-law I ever had.\r\n\r\nShe was hugely entertaining in class but also very demanding.  For one, she made us memorize poems, something I had never done.  One was this poem by Lord Byron, all about youthful arrogance, impetuosity and love:\r\n\r\nStanzas Written on the Road Between Florence and Pisa\r\n\r\nOh, talk not to me of a name great in story;\r\nThe days of our youth are the days of our glory;\r\nAnd the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty\r\nAre worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.\r\n\r\nWhat are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?\r\n''Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:\r\nThen away with all such from the head that is hoary!\r\nWhat care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?\r\n\r\nO Fame! -if I e''er took delight in thy praises,\r\n''Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,\r\nThan to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover\r\nShe thought that I was not unworthy to love her.\r\n\r\nThere chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;\r\nHer glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;\r\nWhen it sparkled o''er aught that was bright in my story,\r\nI knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.\r\n\r\nMemorizing those stanzas was a steep climb for a kid growing up in rural north central Ohio, but there was no getting around it.  I nailed it and can recite it to this day, fifty years later.  Now that I have a “brow that is wrinkled,” not to mention a “head that is hoary,” I view the poem differently than I did when I was 17.  When I recite it to myself, I think, “Heck.  Lord Byron was dead at 36.  What did he know about wrinkles?  Diddley-squat."\r\n\r\nI’ve memorized quite a few poems.  After I have a poem in my head, it sometimes begins to “sing.”  Before I know it, I’m setting it to music.\r\n\r\nWhen I set Lord Byron’s poem to music, in 1977, I tried to capture its high Romanticism, galloping rhythm and breathless, forward-plunging speed.  The song goes by mighty quickly, clocking in at a little over 90 seconds.  \r\n\r\nByron’s title being a bit of a mouthful, I re-named it, “The Days of Our Glory."\r\n \r\nTo hear baritone Dan Hoy’s strapping rendition of “The Days of Our Glory,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 12, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),113);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(55,replace(replace('I want to share what I consider to be one of my best efforts, a song cycle just over twenty minutes long.  \r\n\r\nOf my 400 works, this is almost the only one that brings tears to my eyes.  In the final song, when the singer offers a farewell kiss that comes like a benediction, singing, “My kiss will give peace now and quiet to your heart…” that’s when the lump forms in my throat and the salty sap starts to seep.\r\n \r\n“Along the River” is a set of seven songs, scored for mezzo, flute, clarinet and piano, connected by instrumental interludes.  The cycle tells a sad, beautiful love story.  Sad story, beautiful music.\r\n\r\nA lonely clarinet solo opens the piece with a tender love theme.  You might recognize it because I later expanded it into another work, “The View from Carew,” which is both a single-movement chamber work for clarinet, cello and piano and also the middle movement of my concerto for clarinet and orchestra.  One of my best themes, it is played by all three instruments at various times throughout “Along the River,” though it never appears in the vocal part.  \r\n\r\nA very long time ago, my girlfriend (who, next month, will have been my wife for 44 years) shared with me a wonderful cycle of poems entitled, “Chamber Music” by James Joyce.  Don’t be frightened!  This is the young James Joyce, the youthful genius who gave us “Dubliners” and “A Portrait of the Artist as  Young Man,” not the later, half-mad literatus who conferred “Ulysses” and “Finnegan’s Wake” upon a still baffled world. \r\n\r\nThe poems are written from a man’s point of view, yet I have cast them here to be sung by a woman.  For me, the woman is reading (singing) the man’s love poems back to him, as if to say, “Listen to yourself!  Hear what you sound like!  Understand how you come across!”  Viewed this way, the poems reveal clues as to why the relationship failed.  The woman “explains” this to the man as she says goodbye, using his own words, which are very beautiful and very overwrought.  One can see how she grew weary of such an ardent, needy and loquacious lover.  \r\n\r\nWhat are her feelings?  The music itself is the only hint.  Her feelings, a mingling of sorrow and relief are implied by the way she sings these poems, the way the words are set to music.\r\n\r\nThe seven poems I chose from “Chamber Music” (see below) tell the story, starting out naively happy, gradually darkening, ending in separation and farewell.\r\n\r\nExcept, not quite!  The long piano solo after the soprano finishes her last song, ends the cycle with resignation, yes, but also a wistful radiance.  “Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.”  \r\n\r\nAt the very end, the clarinet repeats a fragment of the naively happy ''springtime'' theme that begins the cycle, as if to say, “The possibility of Love is always present; Love may come again, even to the broken-hearted.”  \r\n\r\n“Along the River” was written for and is dedicated to mezzo soprano Diane Haslam.\r\n\r\nYou are among the few to have heard this beautiful music; the piece has been performed only about a half dozen times.   \r\n\r\nTo hear "Along the River” sung exquisitely and with delicate fervor by Mary Elizabeth Southworth, with flutist Danielle Hundley, clarinetist Marianne Breneman and pianist Phil Amalong (when the four of them perform together, they call their ensemble, “Conundrum,”) click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoems from “Chamber Music” by James Joyce, in the order in which they appear in “Along the River":\r\n\r\nI.   Strings in the earth and air\r\n     Make music sweet;\r\n     Strings by the river where\r\n     The willows meet.\r\n\r\n     There''s music along the river\r\n     For Love wanders there,\r\n     Pale flowers on his mantle,\r\n     Dark leaves on his hair.\r\n\r\n     All softly playing,\r\n     With head to the music bent,\r\n     And fingers straying\r\n     Upon an instrument.\r\n\r\nII.  I would in that sweet bosom be\r\n     (O sweet it is and fair it is!)\r\n     Where no rude wind might visit me.\r\n     Because of sad austerities\r\n     I would in that sweet bosom be.\r\n\r\n     I would be ever in that heart\r\n     (O soft I knock and soft entreat her!)\r\n     Where only peace might be my part.\r\n     Austerities were all the sweeter\r\n     So I were ever in that heart.\r\n\r\nIII. From dewy dreams, my soul, arise,\r\n     From love''s deep slumber and from death,\r\n     For lo! the trees are full of sighs\r\n     Whose leaves the morn admonisheth.\r\n\r\n     Eastward the gradual dawn prevails\r\n     Where softly-burning fires appear,\r\n     Making to tremble all those veils\r\n     Of grey and golden gossamer.\r\n\r\n     While sweetly, gently, secretly,\r\n     The flowery bells of morn are stirred\r\n     And the wise choirs of faery\r\n     Begin (innumerous!) to be heard.\r\n\r\nIV.  Silently she''s combing,\r\n     Combing her long hair\r\n     Silently and graciously,\r\n     With many a pretty air.\r\n\r\n     The sun is in the willow leaves\r\n     And on the dappeled grass,\r\n     And still she''s combing her long hair\r\n     Before the looking-glass.\r\n\r\n     I pray you, cease to comb out,\r\n     Comb out your long hair,\r\n     For I have heard of witchery\r\n     Under a pretty air,\r\n\r\n     That makes as one thing to the lover\r\n     Staying and going hence,\r\n     All fair, with many a pretty air\r\n     And many a negligence.\r\n\r\nV.  This heart that flutters near my heart\r\n     My hope and all my riches is,\r\n     Unhappy when we draw apart\r\n     And happy between kiss and kiss:\r\n     My hope and all my riches—yes!—\r\n     And all my happiness.\r\n\r\n     For there, as in some mossy nest\r\n     The wrens will divers treasures keep,\r\n     I laid those treasures I possessed\r\n     Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep.\r\n     Shall we not be as wise as they\r\n     Though love live but a day?\r\n\r\nVI.  O cool is the valley now\r\n     And there, love, will we go\r\n     For many a choir is singing now\r\n     Where Love did sometime go.\r\n     And hear you not the thrushes calling,\r\n     Calling us away?\r\n     O cool and pleasant is the valley\r\n     And there, love, will we stay.\r\n\r\nVII. Sleep now, O sleep now,\r\n     O you unquiet heart!\r\n     A voice crying "Sleep now"\r\n     Is heard in my heart.\r\n\r\n     The voice of the winter\r\n     Is heard at the door.\r\n     O sleep, for the winter\r\n     Is crying "Sleep no more."\r\n\r\n     My kiss will give peace now\r\n     And quiet to your heart—\r\n     Sleep on in peace now,\r\n     O you unquiet heart!\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 19, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),117);
