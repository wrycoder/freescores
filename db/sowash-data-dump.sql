We half-delude ourselves; maybe this year will be different, maybe winter won''t come.  But November has finally set in, even here in  Ohio''s southernmost (and most Southern) city.\r\n\r\nMy Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and piano is subtitled "Shadows of November."  The subtitle sounds better in French: "Les Ombres de Novembre." That''s how it appears on the score''s cover page because I wrote it for a superb French clarinetist, my good friend Lucien Aubert, and the trio in which he played, who called themselves "les Gavottes."\r\n\r\nYou''re invited to listen to the final movement, 3.5 minutes long, as recorded by les Gavottes. Gosh, they''re good!  You''re going to love this, I predict.\r\n\r\nIt might not sound November-ish, so let me explain.  There are three movements in this work.  The first movement is ambiguous, like a November fog.  The second movement is deeply mournful, perhaps the saddest music I''ve written.  Then comes the third movement, the one I want to share with you this evening.\r\n\r\nTo me, this music expresses the bracing, exuberant, almost vulgar zest of November.  We hunker down, snuggle into a cozy chair, stretch our legs in front of the fire, drink red wine, tell funny stories and laugh with our friends even as, outside, the freezing rain is slicing through the evening air.  Half way through this movement the music becomes so spirited that it almost sounds like a high school band determinedly performing a half-time show in a heavy, pebble-y hail of sleet.  \r\n\r\nThis music is jovial yet biting, as if to say:  the great god Pan never dies, the energy of life is forever reaffirmed.  Which reminds me of a poem I wrote.\r\n\r\nI''ve written five books, but very little poetry.  A few years ago, however, circumstances forced me to devise some words for a November-ish tune of mine which I wanted to include in a choral work.  Choristers need words to sing, so I was forced to become, for once, a lyricist as well as a composer.  I set myself to the task, bore down, wouldn''t quit until I''d come up with something suitable.  \r\n\r\nI think the words I came up with express the same ideas about November that are expressed musically in this trio.  \r\n\r\nHere''s the poem, such as it is.\r\n\r\nLife''s Oldest Song\r\n\r\nGone now are the autumn leaves, \r\nto cold earth they have fled, \r\nand all of the trees seem dreary now \r\nthat once were yellow and red. \r\n\r\nOver us now cold winds are blowing, \r\nmourning the passing of fall, \r\nreminding us of the truth immutable: \r\ndeath comes to us all. \r\n\r\nSuch words we cannot gainsay. \r\nThis truth to all is known, \r\nand we feel it most keenly this time of year, \r\nwhen autumn colors have flown.  \r\n\r\nYet look again at field and forest, \r\nstudy the stubble and twig: \r\na hint of color foretells a blossom \r\nwill bloom forth from each sprig. \r\n\r\nSo friends, let us gather now \r\nand sing Life''s Oldest Song, \r\nreminding ourselves to love that well \r\nwhich we must leave ere long, \r\n\r\nConsoling one another''s sorrows, \r\nraising our voices high, \r\nliving life more fully though knowing \r\nthat, like leaves, we must fly.\r\n\r\nMy Trio #3, "Shadows of November," was recorded by Les Gavottes.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nNovember, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne of my oldest friends is Dick Ferrell, whom I have known for more than half a century.  Back in 1961, when I joined Boy Scout Troop 152 of Lexington, Ohio, I was assigned to the Red Fox Patrol.  Dick was my Patrol Leader.  Through our teens we were together on many, many Scouting adventures — hiking, camping in all weathers, competing in woodcraft skills, cooking over campfires.  We both became Eagle Scouts at the same Court of Honor in 1966.  Later, in our thirties, we served Scouting as adult volunteers, leading High Adventure canoe trips to Algonquin Provincial Park where we saw moose, bears, minks, loons and heard wolves howl at the moon, a sound I will always remember.\r\n\r\nNow we’re old guys.  It’s been a long time since either of us slept in a tent.  “The ground has gotten so much harder than it used to be,” says Dick.  “It must have something to do with global warming.”  \r\n\r\nTroop 152 is still going strong and has turned out nearly a hundred Eagle Scouts.  Dick still lives near Lexington and keeps me posted.\r\n\r\nSometimes he sends me poems he’s written.  Here’s one about the peculiar, stark beauty of this time of year, something Dick and I have observed, firsthand, together, on many a camping trip.\r\n\r\nNovember Has A Beauty All Its Own\r\n\r\nHe views the naked cornfield\r\nRinged with gray and brown and black,\r\nAnd he knows that fall has fallen\r\nAnd there is no turning back.\r\n\r\nThere''s a twinkling of twilight\r\nAs he hurries down the path\r\nTo the warm and candled window\r\nOf his rustic woodsy shack.\r\n\r\nHe smells decay and oldness\r\nMixed with pine and apple scent,\r\nAnd he sees the snow clouds gather\r\nRank on rank, in their ascent.\r\n\r\nHe feels the cold wind quicken,\r\nAnd he hears the forest moan\r\nAs he''s reminded: November has\r\nA beauty all its own.\r\n\r\nIn my Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Shadows of November,” I tried to express it musically.\r\n\r\nTo hear the French trio, “les Gavottes,” play the first movement from "Shadows of November,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 8, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOctober turned my maple’s leaves to gold.\r\nThe most are gone now; here and there, one lingers.\r\nSoon these will slip from the twigs’ weak hold\r\nLike coins between a dying miser’s fingers.   — Thomas Bailey Aldrich\r\n\r\nTo put it plainly, November is upon us.\r\n\r\nAfter evoking April in my second trio for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Enchantment of April,” I immediately began writing work trio for that same, wonderful combination of instruments.  Turning for inspiration to the opposite end of the calendar, I entitled my third trio:  “Shadows of November.”\r\n\r\nThe title sounds better in French:  “Les Ombres de Novembre.”  Don’t roll your eyes!  I am not trying to be fancy-schmancy.  I wrote all thirteen of my clarinet-cello-piano trios for “les Gavottes,” three superb French musicians who make their home on the Riviera and they premiered and recorded several of them.\r\n\r\nThe first and last movements of my November trio are strong and defiant, rippling with dark energy, gainsaying the broodings on death and defeat that the penultimate month can prompt.  \r\n\r\nThe first movement is robust; hearing it now, I remember what it felt like to split logs with a wedge and a sledge on a damp November day, back in the 1980’s when we lived on a half-acre enclosed by woods, at the edge of Gambier, Ohio.  I felt fully awake and alive; my breath was visible, I was conscious of the muscles in my chest and arms, the slow onset of blisters on my hands, the sweat beneath my red woolen stocking cap.  “Who splits his own firewood warms himself twice.”\r\n\r\nThe last movement is robuster yet, striving to channel the deathless energy of Nature herself, hibernating just now, certain to reassert itself come Spring.\r\n\r\nThe middle movement, the music I want to share with you today, squarely faces the inescapable facts of November:  summer is gone, glorious autumn is in full retreat.  Now comes a long string of cold, grim, raw, short, dark days.\r\n\r\nConnecticut writer Odell Shepard gave a voice to November''s intimations; it does me good to ‘hear’ his honest words, so strong, so simple:\r\n\r\n	“The frost walked last night.  From the maple tree that shades my roof, the golden and scarlet  leaves are sidling down through the sunny morning air, leaving at every moment a little more blue.  No cricket sings.  There has been havoc in the multitude of ferns.  Summer is gone and I must soon be going.”  \r\n\r\nHearing this music may do you some good, too.  I hope so.\r\n\r\nTo hear the French trio “les Gavottes” performing the second movement from Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and pian, "Shadows of November,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 6, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of you have kindly asked about my ankle, which I broke falling off a staircase on August 30.  \r\n\r\nCarrying a load of laundry to the basement, unable to see my feet, I thought I was on the last stairstep when I was actually on the penultimate step and strode off into midair, coming down with a snap and a crash.  Not my best moment.\r\n\r\nE.R., X-rays, bone doctor, wheelchair, crutches, boot, cane.  \r\n\r\nBeen there, done that!\r\n\r\nMy ankle is much better now, almost normal.  I’m walking, caneless, and with only a slight limp.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a miracle!  No pills, no salve, nothing except inactivity.  The bone that cracked, the malleolus (I call it the Malvoglio), healed itself.  Amazing!\r\n\r\nThe snap I heard when it broke made me think of a stick, a branch, a tree.  A tree is as alive as we are, but when a branch is broken, it doesn’t heal.  This ankle broke like a branch but, unlike a branch, over time, little connective threads formed, bridging the crack, gradually thickening and filling the tiny emptinesses between them.  I saw four x-rays of the break over a 10-week period.  The progress was visible, just think of that!\r\n\r\nAnd that’s just one of a million miracles that are around us all the time.\r\n\r\n	“Why who makes much of a miracle?  \r\n	As for me, I know of nothing but miracles.”   \r\n				— Walt Whitman, bless his heart\r\n\r\nI’m back to riding my bicycle on the Little Miami Trail, just in time to enjoy the last of the season’s foliage.  One more good rainstorm or a blast of wind and what remains of October’s colors will be over for this year.  The leaves leave, “fall has fallen."   \r\n\r\nOctober is sheer amazement but I like November almost as much.  As my old friend Dick Ferrell says, “November has a beauty all its own.”\r\n\r\nTo get it said right, he wrote this poem:\r\n\r\nHe views the naked cornfield\r\nRinged with gray and brown and black,\r\nAnd he knows that fall has fallen\r\nAnd there is no turning back.\r\n\r\nThere''s a twinkling of twilight\r\nAs he hurries down the path\r\nTo the warm and candled window\r\nOf his rustic woodsy shack.\r\n\r\nHe smells decay and oldness\r\nMixed with pine and apple scent,\r\nAnd he sees the snow clouds gather\r\nRank on rank, in their ascent.\r\n\r\nHe feels the cold wind quicken,\r\nAnd he hears the forest moan\r\nAs he''s reminded once again:\r\nNovember has a beauty all its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nI too have tried to express the dark vigor of November, using, instead of words, the sounds of a clarinet, a cello and a piano.\r\n\r\nTo hear the 3rd movement of Trio #3 for clarinet, cello & piano, “Shadows of November,” played by les Gavottes (clarinetist Lucien Aubert, cellist François Adloff, pianist Jean Tatu), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nWe grieve, rightly.  We seek consolation.\r\n\r\nI falter, trying to find words for such things.  I mean to comfort grieving friends but I don’t know what to say.  The pat response, “I’m so sorry for your loss,” seems the best I can do.  I weep too readily, connoting the opposite of my intention:  that I am the one to be comforted.\r\n\r\nAt least I am there.  When Job is suffering, his friends are there.  They say all the wrong things.  But at least they are there.\r\n\r\n“Who shall ever tell the sorrow of being on this earth?” asks James Agee in his “Knoxville:  Summer of 1915.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot be told.  Perhaps it can sometimes be sung, by instruments as well as voices, the sorrow and the beauty, mingled in a single musical expression….  \r\n\r\nTo hear the 2nd movement of my Trio #3 for Cl, VC & pno, “Shadows of November” played by les Gavottes (clarinetist Lucien Aubert, cellist François Adloff, pianist Jean Tatu), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),55);

You may not think of it this way, but you are gifting me by allowing me to share these musical messages with you.  When artists know their work is engaging an audience, even a small one, It means so much that it feels like a gift. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis time I want to share a short original Christmas carol (2:48; the fourth link on the list above).\r\n\r\nNon-Christian friends and fans, please pardon the Christmas reference.  It''s not my intention to proselytize.  What I want to share is the sweetness of the tune, for its own sake, the Christian content aside.\r\n\r\nThe carol is sung by Jose Rubio, a wonderful baritone who used to live in the apartment right above ours, here on Milton Street in Cincinnati.  It was a joy to hear him vocalizing upstairs!  \r\n\r\nIn this recording, Jose sings the carol with such warmth and feeling that I fancy I can hear him smiling as he sings.  And I love the way rolls his ''r''s.\r\n\r\nAs befits a carol, the tune is simple and doesn''t vary through the four verses.  Instead, it’s the accompaniment that differs for each verse:  the piano is tone-painting the ideas expressed in the lyrics.  \r\n\r\nTo see how this is done, follow the words as you listen:\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morn the birds all wake and fly, cu-roo, \r\nto seek the Child with wand''ring cry, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nthe thrush, the swallow, the bluebird small, \r\nthey gather round His cradle stall, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo. \r\n\r\nThe crow and jay their raucous cries do still, cu-roo, \r\nto join the dove and whippoorwill, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nthe larks in exultation sing \r\nto glorify their newborn King, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo.     	       \r\n\r\nOn silent wings the wise-eye''d owls descend, cu-roo, \r\nthe falcon and the sweet brown wren, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nwith quail and pheasant by Mary''s side \r\nthe folk of field and glen abide, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo. \r\n\r\nThe feather''d choir its cheerful an-thems raise, cu-roo, \r\nto warm the frosty dawn with praise cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nand with the angel host above, \r\nthey greet the tiny Bird of Love, cu-roo, cu-roo.\r\n\r\nThe tune for this carol came to me in a dream in the Fall of 1978.  This has happened only three or four times.  I woke up and wrote it down, quickly!  I was afraid I''d forget it.  I always thought the tune sounded like a Christmas carol; later I added appropriate words.\r\n\r\nIn scoring the tune, I had the idea of including, in the piano part, quotations of one of the world’s most famous melodies.  Several times and especially at the end, you''ll hear the piano accompaniment quoting the opening of J.S. Bach''s most famous tune, "Jesu, Joy of Man''s Desiring." \r\n\r\nBach’s “Jesu” tune is one of the greatest melodies ever conceived, ever-fresh, always a blessing.  What gifts old Bach left for us!  \r\n\r\nJose Rubio is joined by Avedis Manoogian in the recording above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThe Golden Lamb is Ohio’s oldest inn, in operation since 1803.  My grandparents dearly loved the place and sometimes took my brother and me there for weekend stays back in the 1950’s.  I remember sleeping in the huge, carved, Victorian bed in the room that honors Charles Dickens, one of the inn’s many famous guests.\r\n\r\nUnchanged today, the Golden Lamb is a place where I can still feel the presence of my beloved grandparents.  Our own little family dines there, once a year, on Jo’s birthday.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1970’s we stayed in the inn with a group of friends we’d brought down from north central Ohio (where we lived until 1994) to attend the Boar’s Head Festival at Cincinnati’s Christ Church Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne of our party, impressed with the inn’s Christmas decorations, said, “There ought to be a Carol of the Golden Lamb.”   A few weeks later she sent me a sweet little poem she’d written.  Here it is:\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Carol of the Golden Lamb \r\n	 by K. A. (she likes to keep a low profile, unlike a certain hambone composer you know)\r\n\r\nThe frost lay light upon the slopes, \r\nThe stars were crystal thorns, \r\nWhen from the soul of earth''s weak hopes \r\nThe Shepherd Child was born.\r\n\r\nThen came all creatures great and small \r\nTo celebrate the new-born King; \r\nWith muzzled fang and sheathed claw \r\nTheir homage wild to bring. \r\n\r\nBut one small lamb, the only one \r\nOf winged and creeping folk, \r\nNew-born as well, had missed the Son \r\nWhom men of old forespoke. \r\n\r\nWell-guarded by her shepherd''s crook \r\nThe lamb grew ever strong. \r\nYet longing sunny days o''er-took \r\nAnd hushed the lambkin''s song. \r\n\r\nOne hazy dawn she slipped away \r\nTo roam the dusty streets. \r\nShe found the tiny Prince that day \r\nAnd kept her vigil sweet. \r\n\r\nShe watched Him from the open door; \r\nShe dared not enter there\r\nFor fear her hooves upon the floor \r\nWould wake the Infant fair. \r\n\r\nThe Babe awoke and crowed with glee \r\nTo see the curly lamb. \r\nHe crooned in child-like hymnody, \r\nHe waved His tiny hands. \r\n\r\nAnd as she knelt beside His cot, \r\nThe golden Day-spring sun\r\nGlowed soft and shining on her coat — \r\nOf golden ringlets spun. \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nI set this poem to music, first as a choral piece, later as a baritone solo.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Jose Rubio smilingly singing "Carol of The Golden Lamb” (I fancy I can hear his smile, especially in the final line when he rolls the “R” in “ringlets") with collaborative pianist Avedis Manoogian, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 27, 2015\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you hear a smile?\r\n\r\nListen to one of my Christmas carols sung by Jose Rubio, a wonderful baritone who used to live in the apartment above ours.  His vocalizations descended upon us like the Holy Spirit, right through our ceiling!  \r\n\r\nJose’s treatment of this carol has such warmth that I like to fancy I can hear him smiling as he sings.

A language consists of words, as a poet should know.  Nature has yet to speak a word within earshot of me. \r\n\r\nSaint Bernard of Clairvaux asserts:  \r\n	“You will find something more in the woods than in books.  Trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn from masters.” \r\n\r\nWhat is this  “something more” that we will find in the woods?  A heightened sensual awareness?  I can buy that.  A breeze passing through the trees or a stream splashing over stones certainly are “something more” than is found in books.  They are pleasant sounds and happy memories but I cannot say that I have learned anything from them.\r\n\r\n“There are three things we never tire of looking at,” asserted my philosopher friend Bill Tyree, “a flickering flame, water in motion and a baby’s face.”  True enough, but do we actually learn from looking at these manifestations of Nature.  \r\n\r\nIn “As You Like It,” Shakespeare may be satirizing the notion that Nature has it in Her power to educate us, when he puts these words into the mouth of a naive city-dweller, newly converted to the “back to the Earth” movement, upon arriving in the Forest of Arden:\r\n\r\n	“… our life, exempt from public haunt, \r\n	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, \r\n	Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”\r\n	\r\nIs he deluded or just showing off?  Tongues in trees?  Books in brooks?  Sermons in stones?  Good in EVERYTHING?  Ticks?  Mosquitos?  Poison ivy?\r\n\r\nHear how, 2000 years earlier, Socrates set straight his friend Phaedrus:  \r\n\r\n	“We cannot learn anything from trees, comfortable as it may be to converse in their shade.”\r\n\r\nNature does not instruct.  Nor does music.  They are, rather, a fathomless fount of metaphors.  Sermons are not in stones; they are in us.  Stones, regarded as metaphors, help us find varieties of wisdom within ourselves, just as music helps us find states of mind which we already possess.  \r\n\r\nSame with the holly and the ivy, the cardinal, and all the rest of Nature, even, I suppose, the ticks.\r\n\r\nWhile I doubt Nature can teach me anything I do not already know, I happily admit that She often reminds me of things too easily forgotten. \r\n\r\nFor example, Nature, here in Ohio, in January, forces us to recall the vast difference between “gray day” and “Grade A.”  \r\n\r\nA sunny day is Grade A ... a gray day is not.  \r\n\r\n(Grade A?  Gray day?  Ah!  How clever I felt when I thought of that!  Like Bottom who, admiring his own rhetorical flourishes, says, “This was lofty!” -- and makes us laugh.)\r\n\r\nConsider the holly and the ivy.  Ever green, loyal and lovable.  Like the cardinal, they see us through the long winter.\r\n\r\nI remember the sudden upsurge of happiness I''ve felt when, standing at the window early on a winter morning, snug in my woolen robe and fur-lined slippers, pressing my hot coffee mug against my chest, the fragrant steam rising to my face, I''ve glimpsed a bright red cardinal gracing the green holly and spreading English ivy in our snowy side yard.  Nature can help us recall our capacity for feeling happy.\r\n\r\nHolly speaks in quotation marks, like a character in a play, in the last line of a little poem I know, attributed by some to Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n	Green grow''th the holly, so doth the ivy, \r\n	Though winter winds blow never so high, \r\n	Green grow''th the holly. \r\n\r\n	Full gold the harvest, grain for thy labor, \r\n	With God must work for daily bread, \r\n	Else, man, thou starvest. \r\n\r\n	Fast fall the shed leaves, russet and yellow, \r\n	Resting buds are snug and safe \r\n	Where swung the dead leaves. \r\n\r\n	Green grow''th the holly, so doth the ivy, \r\n	The God of life can never die. \r\n	“Hope!” saith the holly.\r\n\r\nBless the holly, the ivy and the resting buds; they do something better than mere instruction:  they remind us to hope, something we sometimes forget to do and of which we need reminding.\r\n\r\nI invented a nice tune for that poem and scored it for baritone and piano.  It''s a carol:  a simple tune repeated without variation, with different lyrics each time.  Good tunes bear repeating; this is a good one.  \r\n\r\nI tried to use the piano to ''paint'' the ideas the words express.  When the leaves are falling fast in the third verse, the piano sketches the scene in fluttering eighth notes.  The bare branches, "where swung the dead leaves," are expressed with the chilly emptiness of octaves.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Jose Rubio singing "Green Grow’th the Holly" with collaborative pianist Avedis Manoogian, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),67);

The strings play beautifully, too:  violinists: Kris Frankenfeld and Elizabeth Steva, violist Dorotea Vismara Hoffman and cellist Ellen Shertzer.  I was fortunate to recruit such fine musicians for this recording and a first-rate recording engineer, too, in the person of John Burgess.  Cincinnati is a remarkably musical city and there are many musically gifted people here.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAn original Christmas Carol?  Would anyone welcome yet another Christmas carol?  Provided that the tune is a good one, sure!  \r\n\r\nI’m guessing that, regarding most familiar Christmas music, you feel what I feel:  weary of it.  If, one more time, while standing in line at the Family Dollar or Walmart, I am forced endure “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” or “Jingle Bell Rock,” stand back.  I may start throwing things.  \r\n\r\nDoes this render me guilty of ‘grinchedness’?\r\n\r\n(By the way, the French word for our English adjective “grumpy" is “grincheux” for a guy, “grincheuse” for a girl.  These French words must have been the origin of the name Dr. Seuss gave his famously grouchy character The Grinch.  Dr. Seuss was an original, a regular pipterino, one of my heroes.)\r\n\r\nThere are a handful of Christmas tunes that I love:  “The Holly and the Ivy,” “Good King Wenceslaus,” “In the Bleak Midwinter,” “What Wondrous Love is This?” and “A Virgin Most Pure.”\r\n\r\nStill, I wouldn’t welcome the opportunity to hear a set of variations on any of those tunes; they''re too familiar. \r\n\r\nThen again, what makes Theme & Variations a romp is not the tune; it’s the variations.   Take Mozart’s variations on “Ah, Vous Dirai-je, Maman” (the tune we know as “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star”)?  It’s tied for first place as the hackneyed-est tune of all time, right up there with “Hot Cross Buns,” “Ring Around the Rosey" and “London Bridge is Falling Down.”  \r\n\r\nBut, Jumpin’ Jehosaphat!  Mozart’s variations are astonishing!\r\n\r\nThe original carol on which I wrote these variations, scored for string trio, is entitled, “A Little Child There is Y-Born.”  It’s a setting of a traditional text the begins with those words.\r\n\r\nAfter a Vaughan-Williams-ish introduction, 17 seconds into the piece, the carol is stated in the violin while the viola and cello pluck their strings, guitar-like.  After several pleasing variations the tune, which has been in a modal minor key all along, bursts out in the parallel major at 2:05 when the violin puts forward a fugue subject based on the carol.  The instruments take up the fugue subject and give it a whirl.  The little piece ends with an uplifting coda.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a short piece, a modest affair, befitting a carol that celebrates the humble birth of You-Know-Who.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Variations on an Original Christmas Carol" for string trio beautifully performed by violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),40);

For hours at a time.  \r\n\r\nFor eight and a half years, I worked two or three days a week as a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, keeping watch over fabulous treasures displayed in large, echoing galleries.  When there were no visitors, I sometimes amused myself by trying to imagine what a painting would sound like if its subject matter were to be conveyed musically.\r\n\r\nThat little mental puzzle resulted in my two three-movement "Impressionist Suites" for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, each movement conveying the imagery and brushwork of a major French Impressionist painter.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Art Museum has only one painting by Monet, but it''s a doozie.  He renders the sombre cliffs of his native Normandy in tones of deep, dark rust and sets them in a tossing, vibrant ocean of sapphire, indigo, emerald and mint, dashed with strokes of salmon, magenta and lavender, arched by clouds like sherbet in a pink-orange sky.\r\n\r\nHow can a composer catch that in music?\r\n\r\nBy consulting his memory.  Our understanding of music is shaped by our memories of all the music we have heard.  When I ran a search through my memory for nautical-sounding music, my recollections were awash with half-remembered sea chanteys, fragments from "HMS Pinafore," "La Mer" and the stirring scores of many a swashbuckling pirate movie.   \r\n\r\nI thought of the ''colors'' of those three piquant instruments:  oboe, clarinet and bassoon.  I put those three instruments to work, playing a canon.  You''ll hear it right off in the low bassoon, then an octave higher in the clarinet, then yet another octave higher in the oboe ... and we''re away! like a ship with sails bellying into the wind! I Into the tossing, dazzling, salt-tanged seascape Monet evoked so memorably.\r\n\r\nI wrote my two Impressionist Suites in 2000 for my friend Lucien Aubert, clarinetist in Le trio d’anches Ozi.  Since these are Frenchmen playing for French audiences, I thought a suite about French Impressionist painters might please all concerned.  And it has.  This Monet movement will please you, too, hopefully. It''s played -- beautifully! -- by Mark Ostoich, Ron Aufmann and Mark Ortwein.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nJanuary 12, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWill you kindly permit me a longer-than-usual message?  \r\n\r\nHave I told you that I’m teaching French?\r\n\r\nIn the 2012-2013 school year I visited, twice, a remarkable K-12 Cincinnati school called “Leaves of Learning," a resource center where home-schooled students come for enrichment — for one or two classes or more, one, two, three or four days a week.  I was very impressed with the joyful, easy, accepting tone of the school and the students’ genuine enthusiasm for learning.  \r\n\r\nYou may know that, in addition to being a composer, I also write and publish books for young people about Ohio history, animals and folklore.  As a result, over the past thirty years, I’ve spent a day or two in more than 2,000 Ohio schools as a Visiting Author.  I became very accustomed to working with young people and have long felt very much at ease in visiting schools, albeit only as a ''One Day Wonder.’   \r\n\r\nToo, in my twenties and thirties, I had been a Scoutmaster.   I’ve always felt happy and at ease with young people.  I like them and they like me.  I had plenty of experience showing kids how to do things — in Scouts and in the schools I’d visited — but I was never a regular teacher, never committed myself to regularly recurring instruction sessions with a particular band of young souls.\r\n\r\nAfter my second day visiting Leaves of Learning, my host, a fine teacher named Terri Burch, said, “You should be teaching here!”  \r\n\r\nI baulked, scoffed.  “I’m not certified.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to be certified to teach here.  Talk to the principal, offer a course or two and if there are enough enrollees, you’ll teach.”\r\n\r\nWell, we set it up for me to start in September of 2014.  I would teach only on Wednesdays.  Two classes:  Music Theory and The Art of Storytelling.  I figured I’d give it a try, one day a week, for one school year.\r\n\r\nI told the principal that I would also be willing to substitute for the teachers of some other subjects as well … Language Arts, History, French.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the French teacher was unwell and I was soon ‘subbing’ for her quite often.  It was a little daunting at first.  My French is strong but it was rusty.  In college, I studied French intensively and did well.  But that was 45 years earlier.  I’ve visited France many times since, often staying in the homes of friends who spoke only French.  I''ve benefited greatly from their patient, humorous corrections of my gusty, improvised, somewhat surreal French.  But could I teach French?  Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you know how best to teach it!\r\n\r\nStill, as a sub, I only needed to stay a little ahead of the students in order to lead the class.\r\n\r\nI found that I loved subbing in French, imparting the mnemonic devices that have worked for me, challenging the students to create new ones, sharing stories of my adventures and blunders as an American joyfully floundering about in French. Plus stories of French history, culture and cuisine, garnered from my reading and experiences.  I am ardent about France, the land of my father’s ancestors.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the French teacher became increasingly unwell and in January of 2015 her bad health finally forced her to retire.  The principal invited me to take over the French program.  I gulped, but accepted the challenge.  Being halfway through a school year would present a particular challenge but I figured I’d survive until May and then we’d see.\r\n\r\nTeaching French the way I thought I could best teach it, free from the constraints of the lesson plans that are necessarily imposed on a substitute teacher, turned out to be a slice of Heaven.  I’ve loved every minute of it.   The school encourages creativity in both faculty and students and we make the most of it!  The students are great souls and we love to joke and ponder together as we explore the intricacies and delicacies of this beautiful, expressive, eccentric language.\r\n\r\nIn my Scout troop we had a saying:  “If it isn''t fun, it isn''t Scouting.”  If something we were doing wasn’t fun, we knew we were doing it wrong.  I apply that same approach in my classes with the happy result that we laugh together, frequently, often loudly.  \r\n\r\nWhen the school year ended and summer began, I found that I missed teaching very much.  I signed on for another year and my enthusiasm for teaching French (and Music Theory and Storytelling, which I have continued to teach) is unabated.\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect to continue teaching at Leaves of Learning for several years, into my seventies.  I tell the students, “I’m the school''s Oldest Living Teacher.”  They laugh.  \r\n\r\n“I’m the Gandalf of this school,” I tell them, “and you guys are the Hobbits!”  They laugh, but in a way, it’s true.  I’ve got the white beard.  I''m jolly but a little mysterious.  I’m very interested in them.  I’ve been “out there,” doing various things in the wide world for a long time -- France, most often -- while they''ve been growing up in the Shire.  \r\n\r\nMost of my trips to France have resulted from my music, one way or another.  I’ve been there for rehearsals, performances, recordings.  I’ve written many works for my French musician friends.  \r\n\r\nMy two “Impressionist Suites” for reed trio, for example.  Each movement attempts to evoke the spirit and character of a major French Impressionist painter.\r\n\r\nToday I’d like to share with you the final movement of the first of the suites.  It’s entitled, “Manet:  Spanish subjects.”  \r\n\r\nFrench people are fascinated by Spain; so far as I can tell, the French seem to consider the Spanish to be more spontaneous than themselves, in closer touch with the earth, with basic passions.  To the French, Spaniards seem to be more alive, more authentic, their approach to Life seeming more vivid, colorful and spicy than than theirs. Just think about “Carmen” or the Spanish subjects in the paintings of Manet.  By contrast, the French seem to view themselves as overly cultivated, too cerebral, too self-conscious, more than a little jaded.\r\n\r\nOf course, to an American like me, an outsider, these attitudes seem almost laughable, laden with stereotypes.  But delicious to discover.\r\n\r\nI hope my delight comes across in this music.  Note that it ends with all three musicians shouting, “Ole!"\r\n\r\nTo hear it played -- beautifully! -- by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 13, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my clarinetist friend Lucien Aubert, who was kindly hosting me in his Nice apartment for five days, asked if I wanted to come along to his gig on Tuesday night, I gladly accepted. \r\n\r\nCome Tuesday morning, Lucien said I should be ready to leave about 3:30 that afternoon.  This surprised me as I had assumed that the gig would take place in Nice.  No, he explained, we had to drive to a village on the far side of Avignon, a 3.5 hour trip.\r\n\r\nThe concert was to be given by Lucien’s reed trio (oboe, clarinet, bassoon) for whom I had written my two “Impressionist Suites,” six movements paying homage to celebrated Impressionist painters.  Because the musicians were French, I wrote the music in what I imagined to be a French style, after the manner of Poulenc, Milhaud, Ibert, Francaix, French composers I admire.  \r\n\r\nTo my surprise, Lucien’s trio didn’t much like the two suites.  Lucien explained that they already had plenty of French music; they had hoped I’d write something that would sound American.  Too late, but a lesson learned.  Still, worse things can be said about music than “it sounds too French.”\r\n\r\nFrom what I saw as we entered the municipality where the concert was to take place, it seemed to have perhaps 400 residents.  A mighty small place for a Tuesday night event.  We met up with the other musicians at one of two little cafè-restaurants operating side-by-side in the village’s ‘downtown.’  I don’t recall the name of the village nor what I ate for supper but I remember that the meal was inexpensive and surprisingly delicious.  I didn’t expect to dine that well in such a tiny burg.  Most of Ohio’s better restaurants are found in cities.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, we crossed the street to the community center, a spruced-up stone barn, at least three centuries old.  It was a comfortable space, with a well-lit stage, a pleasant smell, good acoustics and perhaps 200 folding chairs already in place.  Two hundred!  To fill that many seats, half the village would have to show up.  \r\n\r\nAnother surprise:  the concert was to begin at 9:00 pm.  Nine o’clock PM?  On a Tuesday night?  To hear a reed trio?  If such an event were taking place in Bellville, Ohio, pop. 1500, where I lived for twelve years, not a dozen people would consider attending.  And those who did attend would expect the show to begin at 7:30 and wrap up by 9:00 at the latest, or else.\r\n\r\nNext surprise:  8:55 pm and every seat was filled.  More chairs were set up to accommodate late-comers.  The crowd was attentive and enthusiastic and the music-making was wonderful, no surprise there.  I could sense no impatience or restiveness in the audience.  There were encores, even!  \r\n\r\nThe concert ended about half past eleven.  It was late and I was ready to head back to Nice.  But no.  We returned across the street where both cafés were not only open (two cafés in a village of 400 people!) but crowded.  Extra tables and chairs had been set up, extending out onto the street.  \r\n\r\nThe concert’s attendees, enjoying drinks after the concert, applauded again when we arrived and the three musicians visited every table, shaking hands and accepting the congratulations of every customer.  The manager had reserved a table for us and we finally sat down and ordered.  \r\n\r\nI figured we’d have a drink and then head back.  But no one was leaving.  This made me wonder, for the thousandth time while visiting France, “Do none of these people have to be at work in the morning?”\r\n\r\nAt 1:30 am the party was going strong but the musicians finally took their last bows and headed home.   At best, Lucien and I would be back in Nice by 5 am!  Lucien thought nothing of it.  “We’ll sleep until noon,” he said.\r\n\r\nBut as the miles passed, he became more and more quiet.  He seemed sleepy.  I offered to drive but he refused.  I tried to engage him in conversation to keep him awake but he had little to say.  I grew more worried when, every quarter mile or so, the car weaved a little too close to the shoulder or to the center line.  At what point does one take matters in hand?\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he shook his head and said, “Je m’endors.”  (“I’m falling asleep.”)  He asked me, “Aren’t you sleepy?”  I said, truthfully, that I was not sleepy because, for me, riding across southern France in the moonlight was an adventure.  \r\n\r\nI thought he would relent and allow me to drive, but he didn’t.  Instead, he pulled over and announced that he needed a siesta.  He positioned his seat as far back as it would go and was out like a light.  \r\n\r\nI got out of the car and walked around.  The countryside was empty and desert-y, like our Southwest.  I sat on a rock and looked at the stars, the silhouettes of the mountains and the glow of the distant lights of the Côte d’Azur to the south.  My eyelids were heavy but I couldn’t sleep on a rock.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so, Lucien tooted, I returned to the car and we finished the trip back to Nice.\r\n\r\nEverything about that evening was profoundly non-American.  An SRO crowd in a hamlet of 400 souls, gathered in a 300-year old barn to listen to a reed trio concert, starting at 9PM and then partying afterwards until who knows when -- and on a TUESDAY night, yet?  \r\n\r\nThe whole scene would NEVER happen in any village in America.  At least none that I know of.  Not even Yellow Springs, Ohio.  Not on a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nYet everyone involved -- musicians, audience, café owners -- took the whole thing entirely for granted even as they relished every minute of it.  \r\n\r\nWhat a culture.\r\n\r\nTo hear a beautiful rendering of the Renoir movement from my Impressionist Suite #1, titled "The Play of Colors," played by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),36);

As I read the book, a galloping rhythm kept running through my head, the opening phrase of this delicate piece.  \r\n\r\nI scored the music for harpsichord because the sound of that instrument is, like the unicorn myth itself, peculiar, fragile and antique (though the piece can also be played with good effect upon the piano).\r\n\r\nHarpsichordist Barbara Harbach plays it with sensitivity and flair.  It was her idea to arpeggiate many of the chords and to vary the customary twang of the instrument by using the more delicate lute stop now and again.\r\n\r\nWhen I hear this music, I picture a shy creature, smaller, more graceful than a deer, with grave, dark eyes, gamboling in the moonlight.

Completed in 1935, it was never published, probably because of the economic conditions during the Great Depression.  Editing that manuscript and eventually bringing the book into print was deeply meaningful and immensely satisfying.  \r\n\r\nI love this book and I greatly admire this writer.  His prose style resonates an iron string in me.  I like very much what he says but I admire still more the way he gets it said.\r\n\r\nHis prose comes as close to music as any prose I’ve encountered.  As a writer, his dictum was:  “Make it clear.  Make it simple.  Make it sing.”\r\n\r\nWe refer to the works of composers as “tonal” or “atonal.”  Odell Shepard was a “tonal” writer.  He reveals — in his rhythms, his alliterations and consonances, his lyric flights -- a capacity for musical composition.  He had a fine baritone singing voice, was capable of playing Bach fugues on the organ and Beethoven sonatas on the piano, but so far as I know he never wrote music.  Instead, he wrote musical prose.\r\n\r\nHis style is old-fashioned, of course, befitting the old-fashioned topics he explores.  “All of the topics in this book are old topics,” he proudly asserts.  Only an old-fashioned prose style could have served his ends.\r\n\r\nHis intense appreciation of the beauties of August could not have been rendered in the spare, starved style of Hemingway, let alone the made-for-movies, dialogue-heavy prose so fashionable among today''s best-selling authors which well-meaning friends have misled me into reading.\r\n\r\nI invite you to try to read the following paragraphs by Shepard as much with your ears as with your eyes.  You may want to read this prose aloud, as I sometimes do ... \r\n				“And lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\n				 	The beauty of thy voice."\r\n\r\nThe next six paragraphs are from "The Cabin Down the Glen” in the chapter titled ''Ripening Hours'': \r\n\r\n* * * (quoted text) * * *\r\n\r\n	Looking westward from the hill slope in the morning, I can almost see the landscape change before me while I gaze.  Certainly it is richer and more various in tone than when I stood here yesterday, and I see that if I am to watch the splendor of the year mount slowly through all its delicate gradations, I must be vigilant from hour to hour.  \r\n\r\n	Early summer’s monotony of green has given place to the tints of maturity; brown and purple, dim orange and umber are faintly discernible along the lower slopes, and there are rare touches of scarlet from the dogwood and sumac in the thicket.  Single trees that I have never distinguished before stand forth now from their backgrounds and claim a separate attention.  The cedars far and near begin to glow with their peculiar nameless hue, which is not quite olive as one sees it elsewhere but a sort of olive beatified.  Among the solid ranks of the ferns at my feet there is here and there a frond that seems to be made of beaten gold.  \r\n\r\n	Slowly, leaf by leaf, yet swiftly too, if the total volume of change is considered, the landscape is turning golden and ruddy, like an apple, beneath these August suns.\r\n\r\n	Winter in these New England hills is a long stern conflict, spring is a brief ecstasy like first love, and autumn is sheer amazement, but late summer brings us peace.  Then it is, if ever, that we pass the bounds of mere admiration for the outer show of sky and field and penetrate to understanding.  Then we can almost fancy at times that we see the hills and valleys as the hawk does, while wheeling high in the noon, and the woods as the shy doe sees them with her soft and guileless eyes.  Woods and hills and valleys have put off their strangeness and have given us back their fellowship.\r\n\r\n	Ah, to set out on a walk now, and a long one, through this ripe country of the summer hills; to loiter along lanes grass grown and spotted with shifting shade, where the goldenrod brightens the sunshine and the cardinal flower flows in the cool; to lean for hours over bridges while fancy follows the curl of the waves, and to lean on fence-rails at evening while my thoughts grow still as the corn; to ask my way of no one because one way is as good as another; to be free once more as the tiny glistening ball of thistle-tuft that slowly twirls and drifts and settles high up in the blue of noon; to find all the things I need and many that I do not deserve because I look for nothing; to lose haste and eagerness without losing intensity; to make my peace once more with the good brown earth from which I came and back to which I go; sometimes to sing because I am happy, sometimes to talk to myself because no other listener would understand, but most times to be silent because the only things worth saying are so far beyond the reach of words.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	Ah, to sink down and down into the ancient quiet that broods among the hills, seeking no man’s company -- and yet, perhaps, to meet my better self someday on a bridge or a brown hilltop or resting beside a brook in the softly breathing woods, and to have some talk with him!\r\n\r\n* * * (end of quoted text) * * *\r\n\r\nI like to think that my drowsy Pastorale for flute and strings would enhance and deepen a moment of rest "beside a brook in the softly breathing wood."\r\n\r\nTo hear Pastorale for flute and strings, played by these fine Cincinnati musicians: the softly breathing flutist Betty Douglas, violinist Marion Peraza, violist Dorotea Hoffman and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the full score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),28);

They wanted music they could play at weddings when there would be no piano available, the musical forces being only the two of them:  a flutist and a cellist.\r\n\r\nImagining what I fancied would be appropriate music for a wedding ceremony, I wrote a work in five short movements, which are entitled:\r\n\r\n	I.

And this coming December will mark the 50th anniversary of our first date.  I can hardly grasp that Jo and I have passed that many years in the close company of one another.\r\n\r\nI like what Will Durant said:  "The love we have in our youth is superficial compared to the love that an old man has for his old wife.”\r\n\r\nI know that is true but, honestly, I don’t think of myself as an old man and I don’t think of Jo as an old wife.  Heck, I’m only 67!  And she’s 66!  (Yes, I married ''a younger woman.’)\r\n\r\nStill, superficially or otherwise, a half century in love with the same lady is, well, a long time.  It’s not exactly an achievement.  It wasn’t some steep task that we were determined to accomplish against all odds.  We just kept on keeping on, day by day, sharing a great many laughs and not a few ongoing negotiations while half a century slipped by.\r\n\r\nI once told an older, long-married friend, “When it comes to women, I’ve never been adventurous, never ventured out beyond the shallow water close to shore.  No, in my whole life I really only had just the one girl friend and she became just the one wife.”\r\n\r\nMy friend looked at me closely and said, “You’ve got it exactly backwards.  You have ventured far, far beyond the shallow water close to shore.  You’ve made the epic journey, you and your wife.”\r\n\r\nI knew at once that she was right and that there was nothing more to be said.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, let’s hear some quietly joyful wedding music, the second movement from my Ceremony for Flute and Cello, written specifically to be played at weddings, beautifully played by flutist Betty Braunstein and cellist Josh Aerie.  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the sore, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	“And now comes in the sweet o’ the year!” Jack Falstaff would say if he were with us and had been rightly instructed in American foods and drinks.  Of course he would not have in mind the armies of the goldenrod, the “frosty asters like a smoke upon the hills,” the smoldering crumble of hues in the maple tree, or the bonfires burning gold and crimson on the verge of twilight.  \r\n\r\n	Sound belly-timber would be his notion of a “sweet,” and at this season that would bring salivary thoughts of brown apple betty loaded with spices, of soft cider just oozed from the press, of hard cider ennobled by age, of applejack turned into liquid fire by successive imprisonments in ice, of apple cobbler, apple turnover, applesauce served with roast pork, deep-dish apple crumble served with ice cream, and of apple pie in its glory, with a roof of crust over top.\r\n\r\n	Yet the fact that the apple is good to eat and drink seems a gross consideration when we recall that it is a big sister of the rose, delightful in shape and hue and odor, as lovely in the fruit as in the flower.  Thinking back from October to May, from the bough so laden that it has to be propped to the time when its burden was mostly bloom and numberless bees, we realize that the harvest of apples is one of the dreams that come true.\r\n\r\n	We could only dream of it back there when the orchard smelled like a wine of the gods and every flower was a tavern; but now here it is, this largess, this bounty!  No matter how hard we have toiled to bring it about, we always know, even in an off-year, that the apple harvest is better than we deserve.”		\r\n				— Odell Shepard (1885 - 1967)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is prose one can admire!  Musical, rhythmical, lively prose.  Tonal prose, conservative in the best sense.  Lyrical, pleasing, a joy to read aloud or with the inner voice we hear in our mind’s ear when silently reading to ourselves alone.\r\n\r\nShepard, author, poet, musician, to me a hero, taught English at Trinity College.  One of his former students shared with me his axiom about writing:  “Make it clear.  Make it simple.  Make it sing!”\r\n\r\nSuperb advice.  The man practiced what he preached.\r\n\r\nHow does prose SING?  In rhythmical, alliterative phrases like these:\r\n\r\n“the smoldering crumble of hues”\r\n\r\n“soft cider just oozed from the press"\r\n\r\n"its burden was mostly bloom and numberless bees”\r\n\r\nAh, I bask in prose such as that.  \r\n\r\nHe finds ‘le mot juste’, the right word:  \r\n\r\n“crumble”  “oozed”  “numberless”  and “salivary thoughts."\r\n\r\nWell said, sir!  Well said!\r\n\r\nI love his merriment, too, and his modesty, his evident joy in writing about a gloriously humble thing, the apple.\r\n\r\nWould that there was more such prose-poetry in this sorry, shaken, post-modern year.  Shepard contributed what he could, while he could.  He makes me smile.\r\n\r\nMay each of us contribute what we can, while we can.  May we prompt smiles.\r\n\r\nHere’s a brief thing I’ve done, musically, that may induce a smile.

Looks may deceive.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of my presentation on writing and creativity, I invited them to ask questions.  To my astonishment, almost every hand went up.  \r\n\r\nIf you have presented programs for teenagers you will know what astonished me.  \r\n\r\nAs an author who has written mostly for young people, I have visited more than two thousand schools, presenting assemblies and workshops.  I’ve learned what to expect from youthful audiences and to adjust my expectations according to how old they are. \r\n\r\nGive Kindergarten through second-grade kids a chance to ask questions and lots of hands go up.  Less so with fourth- through sixth-graders.  \r\n\r\nGive teenagers the opportunity and rarely will a hand be raised.  \r\n\r\nHow to break the ice?  Why is there ice in the first place?  \r\n\r\nFear.  Most teenagers are frightened of each other, scared of appearing to be too “goody-goody” in front of their peers, terrified that they will be mocked for asking the “Nice Mister Author Man” a question.  \r\n\r\nBut the teenagers I mentioned above were different.  They did not fear one another.  They liked and supported one another.  They ventured lively questions and then, after I answered, they pushed for yet more information.  I thought, “What an extraordinary group of young people.  What an extraordinary school.”\r\n\r\nOne of the students I met that first day was Ian Fisher, an ardent young reader who, I learned later, often ponders the question, “What book next?”  More about Ian anon.  \r\n\r\n“Leaves of Learning” is the school’s name.  The students, about 260 of them, aged 3 through 18, are home-schooled.  They come to LOL for enrichment, studying subjects they cannot learn at home.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of my day as a Visiting Author at Leaves of Learning — November 5, 2013, a day that changed my life -- my friend and hostess, teacher Terri Burch, who had arranged for me to visit the school, pronounced:  “You should be teaching here!”\r\n\r\nI was intrigued.  \r\n\r\nI’d never taught before and I love my leisure, but I thought teaching at such a school might be fun.  I decided to give a try, to teach just one school-year, courses in French, Music Theory and Storytelling.  \r\n\r\nCome May, the students were happy, the parents were happy, the director was happy and I, “Monsieur Sauvage” (as my Frenchies call me) was the happiest of all.  I’ve been joyfully teaching there ever since. \r\n\r\nOne of those happy students was the afore-mentioned Ian Fisher.  When he enrolled in my courses, I got in the habit of asking Ian, “What are you reading now?”  His answers fascinated me.  Most of the titles he mentioned were new to me.   Novels from Japan and Central America, histories of remote and exotic places, biographies of people as unknown to me as I would be to them.  \r\n\r\nOne day I asked him, “Ian, how do you choose what book you are going to read next?”  He thought about it.  “I don’t really know,” he confessed at last.  “I keep a stack of them around and just find my way.”\r\n\r\nEver since I was about thirteen -- Ian’s age when I first met him — I’ve wrestled with the problem of how to decide what to read next.  When Ian admitted that he didn’t know how he made his choices, I suddenly remembered that I had drafted a little book on exactly that question, years earlier.  It had seemed like a promising idea for a book, and I had enjoyed developing it, but I had never done anything more with it, never brought it into print.  \r\n\r\nNow I realized that my embryonic book might grow into a valuable resource for Ian and other readers.  \r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 2014, Ian and I tossed ideas back and forth.  That summer I tutored Ian in French, but we spent a lot of our lesson time talking about how we made our reading choices.  \r\n\r\nI read the draft I’d written and shared it with my friend Pat Marriott who delighted in it, encouraged me to publish it, and volunteered his services as an editor.  We set to work. \r\n\r\nHere’s the description that will appear on the back cover:\r\n\r\n	Every reader faces the question “What book next?”  The realm of reading choices is vast and bewildering.  In this unusual book, author/composer Rick Sowash gives an account of his adventures as a reader who, grappling with his own bewilderment, arrives at practical and inspiring insights for readers trying to decide: “What book next?” \r\n\r\nI’m still teaching at “Leaves,” where Ian Fisher is now a senior (very tall and very well-read, you may be sure!).  \r\n\r\nWhat joy it is to teach at such a place!  I get to explore my favorite subjects in the company of intelligent and delightful young people who share my enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nJust think:  I’m teaching people who are fifty years younger than I am!  \r\n\r\nI’m a professional Grandpa!\r\n\r\nLike all non-profit organizations, our school needs to raise money.  Having seen the beneficial effects the school has had on so many students, I’m launching “What Book Next?” so as to generate a little moolah for the school.  \r\n\r\n100% of my profits – royalties from commercial sales and profits from copies purchased from me by friends and fans like you -- will be donated to the school.\r\n\r\nI am proud to do this, proud to be a teacher at Leaves of Learning, proud of my students, proud to put my talents, such as they are, into the service of a good cause.\r\n\r\nThe principles and ideals that are conveyed in “What Book Next?" are  those of our school.  To wit, both the book and the school embrace the notion that each of us is responsible for our own education and that learning is life-long.  \r\n\r\nWould you like to read “What Book Next?”  You’ll get your chance!  It’s due to come out next month.  That’s when I’ll send y''all a mid-week email (not to be confused with my Sunday morning e-pistles, where nothing is ever offered for sale nor ever will be) with an order form offering the book for $9.95 plus shipping.  \r\n\r\nFriends and fans who can’t afford the purchase:   let me know and I’ll send you a free PDF instead.  \r\n\r\nWhat times we live in when such a thing is possible!\r\n\r\nNow let’s get to some music!\r\n\r\nTo hear Betty Braunstein and Josh Aerie play the Postlude from my Ceremony for flute and cello, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),65);

We need something to make us smile. \r\n\r\nLet''s make off to sunny ancient Greece and spend a little time with that lovable cuss, Diogenes!\r\n\r\nI offer you The Philosopher, the first movement of a three-movement choral work entitled: Philosophical Anecdotes.\r\n\r\nI wrote this piece in 1979 for the Kenyon College Choir.  I thought about the students who would sing it.  They study philosophy and classics; surely they''d like to sing something sublime, ancient, Greek.  But Kenyon students also have a sense of the irony of their situation, pursuing the liberal arts in Gambier, Ohio, surrounded by cornfields.\r\n\r\nI remembered Diogenes, the great curmudgeon.  An ancient Greek philosopher, yes, but a wag, a grump, a mocker of mundane values.  I thought that irreverent settings of anecdotes about a guy like Diogenes might appeal to the students.  It did!  They sang the music with gusto!\r\n\r\nThree of Diogenes'' exploits are recounted in the piece.  The first movement, The Philosopher, sets to music a prose account of the old grump’s most celebrated moment, when he snubs Alexander the Great.  The opening words of the story have a distinctive calypso rhythm.  Recite them yourself:  "The philosopher Diogenes lived in a tub!"  Snap your fingers as you half-speak/half-sing those words.  Accent the important syllables and, bingo, you''ve got the opening of my setting, and thus the mood for the whole piece, an improbable combination of ancient Athens and calypso music!\r\n\r\nI love to write rounds.  Choirs learn them quickly and easily.  Singing a round, a choir can sound terrific after only a few minutes of rehearsal.  My setting of those words about Diogenes just happened to make a couple of mighty fine rounds!  You''ll hear them sung first in unison, then in parts.\r\n\r\nThe second movement recounts Diogenes'' famous search, with a lantern, in broad daylight, for an honest man, the third his contemptuous quip upon visiting a country fair, "Lord, how many things there are in the world of which Diogenes hath no need!"  Those movements are funny, too, but let''s hear them for some other time.\r\n\r\nFor now, you''re cordially invited to pass three minutes in the company of Diogenes.  Don''t expect much from him!  Alexander the Great would have done anything for Diogenes, but the philosopher''s only request of the most powerful man in the world was that he get out of his light. \r\n\r\nHa!  You have to love the old rascal!\r\n\r\nPhilosophical Anecdotes is performed here by The Gregg Smith Singers.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nJanuary 26, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWeary of dreary February?  Let’s make off to sunny Greece and spend a little time in the company of that lovable sourpuss, Diogenes!\r\n\r\nI offer you The Search, the second movement of a three-movement choral work entitled Philosophical Anecdotes which I wrote in 1979 for the Kenyon College Choir.  \r\n\r\nDiogenes is philosophy''s great curmudgeon, the Grecian Groucho.  A wag, a scold, a mocker of mundane values.  I thought that settings of anecdotes about the irreverent Mr. Diogenes might appeal to the Kenyon students.  I was right!  They sang it lustily!\r\n\r\nThree of Diogenes'' exploits are recounted in the piece.  The first movement sets to music an account of the old grump’s celebrated snub of Alexander the Great, no less.  The last movement recounts Diogenes’ visit to a country fair where he snorts at all the frivolous “finnimbruns” offered for sale.\r\n\r\nIn the second movement, Diogenes does ‘street theatre,’ carrying a lit lantern through Athens, mid-day, begging the question, “What are you doing, Diogenes?”  He has his answer ready:  “Looking for an honest man."\r\n\r\nHa!  You have to love the old rascal!\r\n\r\nIf you want to follow the lyrics as you listen to my setting, here they are:\r\n\r\n“Diogenes’ Lanthorne” by Samuel Rowlands, 1628\r\n\r\n"Athens I seek for honest men,\r\nBut I shall find them God knows when.\r\nI’ll search the city, where I can see\r\nOne honest man, he shall go home with me."\r\n\r\nAn odd day’s work Diogenes once made\r\nAnd ’twas to seek an honest man, he sayed.\r\nThrough Athens with a lantern he did go\r\nWhen people saw no cause he should do so\r\nFor it was mid-day and the sun did shine,\r\nYet he unto a humor did incline.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Athens I seek … etc."\r\n\r\nHe spake as free to Alexander’s face\r\nAs if the meanest plowman were in his place.\r\n’Twas no men’s persons that he did respect,\r\nNo matter where he looked, vice he did detect.\r\n\r\nImagine you see him walking your streets\r\nAnd everyone’s a knave with whom he meets.\r\nNote their descriptions, which good censure craves,\r\nThen judge if he rightly might count them all knaves.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Athens I seek … etc."   \r\n\r\nTo hear the Gregg Smith Singers performing The Search from Philosophical Anecdotes, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 26, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),94);

What times we live in, when such things are possible!\r\n\r\nWhat makes it "An Appalachian Lord''s Prayer?  The words and the melody.  \r\n\r\nI adapted the traditional Lord''s Prayer, adding some Appalachian imagery.  Here is the text:\r\n\r\n	Beloved God, beyond the mountains, hallowed be Thy name, \r\n	Thy kin-dom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. \r\n	Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts \r\n	as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation. \r\n	Deliver us, we pray, from evil, for Thine is the kin-dom, \r\n	the power of morning, the sunset glory, now and forever more.

It''s not Bluegrass. \r\n\r\nInstead, the tune recalls those beautiful pentatonic Southern folk hymns, such as "The Lone Wild Bird," My Shepherd Will Supply My Need" and "Jerusalem, My Happy Home."\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOctober, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	(The Lord’s Prayer is a Christian text and many of you are not Christian.  I''m sharing this message NOT to proselytize but only because I think you might enjoy discovering the thinking behind the composing and, even more, hearing the music, beautifully sung by the Harvard University Choir.)  \r\n\r\nI love The Lord’s Prayer.  I recite it silently every morning in the bathtub.  Don’t laugh!  For me, my big, beautiful, clawfoot bathtub is a "thin place.”  \r\n\r\nI love asking that daily bread be given to US, not just to ME.  “Give me this day my daily bread” is laughable until we remember how many people seem to watch out only for themselves and how many are without bread.\r\n\r\nI love the humility and simplicity of bread.  Only bread is requested.  Mere bread.  No St. André cheese, no Provençal olives, no pesto.  No mention of a robust Côtes du Rhône.  Those would be mighty nice, but that is not the point.\r\n\r\nI love how the word “daily” acknowledges that we are fleshy beings, not wispy spirits, that our tummies will hunger for food for as long as our lungs hunger for air.\r\n\r\nThe Lord’s Prayer cannot be improved.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps some insights can be gleaned by considering what it might mean when uttered in contexts different than those of our customary lives.\r\n\r\nWhat would the prayer mean if we were starving or if we had superfluous wealth?  What would it mean if our livelihood depended upon criminal activity or if we were truly saintly?  How does its meaning vary when uttered in a desert, in a jungle, in a poverty-stricken inner city, alone at sea or in a space station slowly circling the globe?\r\n\r\nHow does The Lord’s Prayer mean in the Appalachian regions of our country, of Ohio?\r\n\r\nI tried to imagine answers for that last question when I set to music The Lord’s Prayer, entitling my setting "An Appalachian Lord''s Prayer." \r\n\r\nI made bold to adapt the words, lacing the verses with elements of the natural world that come to mind when thinking of the Appalachians.  \r\n\r\nInstead of “Our Father who art in Heaven...” my version begins, "Beloved God, beyond the mountains…” \r\n\r\nI augmented the traditional Protestant ending (not found in the Bible) so as to be sung, "the power of morning, the sunset glory.” \r\n\r\nI substituted "kin-dom" for "Kingdom" because it seems closer to what Jesus taught:  that we are each other''s kinfolk and must look out for one another, that we must ‘have our neighbor’s back,’ that we are all God’s kin-folk, that the relationship is that of a child and a loving parent.  \r\n\r\n“Kin-folk” and “kin-dom” are concepts every Appalachian understands.  “Kingdom,” on the other hand, seems alien, ancient, European.  Our country began by throwing off a monarchy.  Begging for a “kingdom” to “come” seems counter-intuitive to us.  “Kin,” on the other hand, feels right.\r\n\r\nHere is my “Appalachian” adaptation of the text:\r\n\r\n		Beloved God, beyond the mountains, hallowed be Thy name, \r\n		Thy kin-dom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. \r\n		Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts \r\n		as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation. \r\n		Deliver us, we pray, from evil, for Thine is the kin-dom, \r\n		the power of morning, the sunset glory, now and forever more. \r\n\r\nMy tune is intended to recall those beautiful pentatonic Southern folk hymns, such as "The Lone Wild Bird," "My Shepherd Will Supply My Need,“ “Dunlap Creek” and "Jerusalem, My Happy Home."\r\n\r\nTo hear An Appalachian Lord''s Prayer sung by the Harvard University Choir, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),14);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(11,replace(replace('Today I''m thinking about heroes, what makes a hero, and how to express heroism musically.\r\n\r\nI''ve known some heroes.  My father, Colonel Richard Sowash, US Army Reserves, was a decorated hero of WWII.  My Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," written in 2000, is dedicated to his memory.  \r\n\r\nMy Scoutmaster, Frank Culp, was a hero to me and to many other young men who came through Troop 152 in Lexington, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nMy grandfather, John Hoff, whose influence was the most important in my life, about whom I wrote lovingly in my otherwise comical autobiography, The Boy Who Would Be Famous, entertained and inspired me, as a boy, with splendid stories of heroes from American history.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago I wrote a book for older elementary school children entitled, "Heroes of Ohio:  23 True Tales of Courage and Character," dedicated to that same grandfather.   For that book, my definition of a hero was:  someone who volunteers to do something challenging to help other people.  Simple!\r\n\r\nExpressing heroism musically is not so simple.  \r\n\r\nComposers have expressed heroism:  Beethoven''s Eroica Symphony, Wagner''s Gotterdammerung, Strauss'' Ein Heldenleben.\r\n\r\nBut they lived long ago and far away and their heroic music, great as it may be, feels remote, perhaps too lofty, as an expression of heroism in the "here and now" of our own time.\r\n\r\nToo, those are orchestral works.  When I set out to express heroism, I was writing for just three instruments:  violin, cello and piano.  Quite a different thing!  No brass, no timpani, no string and wind sections sawing and tooting, triple forte.\r\n\r\nMost of the heroic music that genuinely moves me reached my ears via film scores for great Hollywood westerns like The Magnificent Seven, How The West Was Won, The Big Country. Also the TV westerns I grew up watching:  Wagon Train, Bonanza.  To me, that is what the music of heroism sounds like.\r\n\r\nYet not exactly, not entirely.  After all, I am not a composer writing scores for Hollywood westerns.  My peculiar career has been as far removed from Hollywood as it has been from Academe or the New York avant garde.  My challenge was to find a way to incorporate the galloping excitement, the expansive textures and the sense of adventure found in the best western film scores into a work of serious, contemporary chamber music.\r\n\r\nThe result is this Presto, the final movement from my Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," in which a feeling of heroism is intended to prevail over the darker, troubled music of the earlier movements.\r\n\r\nDoes this final movement sound "too Hollywood?"  I don''t think so.  You''d never hear music like this in a western film score.  Does it genuinely express heroism, in a way that transcends the Hollywood influences?  See what you think.\r\n\r\nThe Presto from my Eroica trio is beautifully performed by violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nFeb. 23, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThe terrifying events of September 11, 2001, brought sudden death to innocent people, called forth great heroism and sacrifice in the community of public servants who stand ready to try to rescue the imperiled, consigned many more to deep mourning in the months and years that followed, stirred dark urges for vengeance, precipitated our mad plunge into war with Iraq which in turn brought ceaseless chaos to the Middle East, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and displacing millions more.\r\n\r\nThe president chose Cincinnati’s Museum Center as the venue to announce that America was going to war with Iraq.  With a couple hundred other Cincinnatians, I stood in the street outside, a pathetic figure, an obscure composer holding a home-made cardboard sign, protesting.  We knew it was futile.  Polls at the time indicated that fully 90% of Americans were strongly in favor of invading Iraq.  Now almost all Americans say it was a mistake.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anything could have stopped it.  What if John Paul II, the popular but enfeebled pope, would have come to Washington D.C., knelt on the steps of our Capital building?  What if, with the press crowding round, he had loudly prayed, begging God to sway America from this bad idea?  Come to think of it, why didn’t he do that?  I’m not Catholic but it seems like the sort of thing the pope and other major religious leaders ought to do.  Where were they?  I wonder if the current pope would do such a thing. \r\n\r\nWhen you screw up, you find out who your friends are:  they''re the ones who tell you that you are screwing up.  \r\n\r\nFrance, our oldest ally, the only major world power against whom America has never gone to war, without whose support our own Revolution would have failed, sternly warned us against invading Iraq.  Americans bitterly decried France for speaking up.  Many demanded to know if the Frenchies had forgotten D-Day and how, at great cost to ourselves, we had liberated them from the Nazis.\r\n\r\nCincinnatians and Americans everywhere ceased patronizing French restaurants.  The makers of French’s mustard ran TV ads, assuring viewers that French''s mustard wasn’t actually French; it was "just a family name."  In a bold gesture, our sagacious Congress forbade the serving of “French fries” in the Congressional cafeteria; the popular potato product was instead to be termed, “Freedom fries.”  That showed ‘em!   Absurd! \r\n\r\n“Nine Eleven” was fifteen years ago today but the miseries it precipitated continue to be suffered by ever greater numbers of people and in ever widening geographical circles.  Almost every day brings staggering news of terrorist attacks and heartbreaking stories of refugees, news that is nearly unbearable to hear and see.  Our war in Afghanistan is the longest in our history.  The Syrian Civil War has no end in sight.  Other countries in the region are on the brink of war.  Who knows when and how it will end?\r\n\r\nOur pastor knew how it could end.  The Sunday after the 9/11 attack, he said, “Terrorist attacks against America will cease only when we have befriended our enemies.”  It sounds like something a pastor would say.  Or Jesus.  Or Gandhi.  \r\n\r\nYou hear that, you nod your head in agreement, it makes sense ... and then it hits you:  “How can we ever befriend such crazy people?”  How indeed.  That’s the question that the best among us must continue to ponder.  I don’t know the answer but I am certain that it’s the right question to ask.  \r\n\r\nIt begs another question.  Are we currently doing anything to befriend our enemies?  It appears to me that our actions, since 9/11, have only served to make our enemies hate us all the more.  Sigh.\r\n\r\nAll this darkness reposed, unguessable, in the not-so-distant future when, in 2000, I wrote my fifth piano trio and subtitled it “Eroica.”  My fiftieth birthday arrived shortly after the millennium.  With those two major milestones in mind — 50 and 2000 -- I felt prompted to try to do something lofty and grand, to write as “great” a piece of music as I could.  Something Beethovenian, if possible.  \r\n\r\nI chose to try to express heroism.  “Eroica” is the Latin word for “heroic” and I subtitled the trio with this word, deliberately echoing Beethoven’s choice of that moniker for his great Third Symphony.\r\n\r\nWhen I was writing my Eroica trio I could not have foreseen that it would turn out to be a piece I’d want to share on what would become a tragic anniversary, September 11.\r\n\r\nWell, here we are, September 11, 2016 and I find myself asking you to listen to a piece of music, though I know that mere listening is a scant and shallow consolation.  \r\n\r\nConfronted with such Evil, what good comes of hearing music?  Yet how can we acknowledge or express what we feel about this dark anniversary?  How shall we shape our lives in response to it, today and in the days to come? \r\n\r\nAs most of us are not artists, we turn to the arts, in the hope of finding expressions on our behalf.  We know what we feel but we cannot find the words, the paint or the tunes; we cannot say it for ourselves.  \r\n\r\nWe can remember that we are not the first to confront a foundering, floundering world. We can ponder anew the wise counsel of those who have faced such a prospect before us.  Their words may console us more effectively than paintings or pieces of music.\r\n\r\nIn 1935 when the world''s economy had collapsed and fascism was on the rise, Odell Shepard, an America author whose writing I admire very much, wrote these words in his forgotten little book, The Cabin Down the Glen… \r\n\r\n	"At such a time in the world’s affairs, what can a man do to help -- a man who feels, as I feel it, his incalculable debt and obligation to mankind?  Shall he add his voice to the shouters?  Shall he too rush here and there?  Shall he get himself elected, or wealthy, or famous, so that he may increase his “influence?”  Or might he do perhaps as well if he should strive not so much to do as to be something?  … Better and more persuasive than anything he could say would be the example of a life lived quietly with the First Things, a life resting down upon the things found true, a life delving under and soaring over the wreck of the present to the things that everlastingly endure.”\r\n\r\nOn this September 11, I hope you find these words as comforting and inspiring as I do.  \r\n\r\nWhile Shepard’s words are still ringing in your consciousness, I invite you to listen to the opening movement of my Eroica trio, performed with passion and grace by my friends violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong.

"It’s entitled Eroica which is the Latin word for ‘heroic.''  Beethoven copped it for his Symphony #3 and I pulled the same stunt for my Piano Trio #5, which is the title work on that CD.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he said, putting down the CD and beating a hasty retreat before I could discern whether he was disappointed or relieved.\r\n\r\nYes, I have done time as a street vendor, hustling my product line to whomever sauntered by.\r\n\r\nFor several years, aspiring to be a fully engaged participant in this greatest of capitalist democracies, I strategically positioned myself, every Saturday morning, at Cincinnati’s historic Findlay Market.  I manfully took my place, cheek by jowl, with aproned butchers, cheese-mongers, fish-vendors and any number of other merchants, purveyors of vegetables, honeys, hand-made candles, soaps and myriad other finnimbruns.   \r\n\r\nI set up a card table and arranged my CDs in an appealing display, offering them for the inspection of all and sundry, smoothing the path for the possibility of a purchase by the likes of John Q. Public, Jane Doe, and Joe Sixpack.  \r\n\r\nI would embrace Free Enterprise!  Disdainer of arts council grants and/or the shelter of an academic niche, I felt I needs must stand toe-to-toe with my public; I would clasp ‘the invisible hand of the marketplace;’ I would swap the fruits of my artistic endeavors for filthy lucre!\r\n\r\nIt was fun.  Friends, spotting my stand at the market, asked me what I was up to.  “Hawking my wares!” was my riposte.  “Like the Pie-man whom Simple Simon met, going to the Fair.”  \r\n\r\nI chaffed with strangers, too, humanoids as new to me as I was to them, enchanting one and all with my bright smile and merry sallies.  I tickled such fancies as were within earshot by rendering well-known ditties on my recorder.  I brought along the wooden blocks my father made for me when I was a lad and built little castles and towers to attract the attention of passersby.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while I even sold a CD, though not to the gentleman who had misread the title of the CD, Eroica.  \r\n\r\nAfter a while, I thought I’d branch out.\r\n\r\nOne Monday morning, I set up my card table on the sidewalk in front of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, figuring music students might be curious to discover the work of a classical composer with the verve and chutzpah to offer his best efforts in the above-described manner.  Fully 75 minutes passed before a uniformed officer in the employ of Campus Security, safeguarding the purity of our academic institutions from the besmirching effects of commerce, ran me off.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, I thought, what if I had resisted?  What if I had drawn myself up, looked the officer in the eye and refused to leave?  What would he have done?  Called for back up.  Then what?  What if the students had used their cell phones to film what would happen next, to wit, the police overturning my table, frisking me, handcuffing me and pushing me into the paddy wagon? \r\n\r\nHeck, a youtube like that might have ‘gone viral.’  I might have become famous overnight.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it would have generated an unusual news story.  “Local classical composer arrested for attempting to sell CDs of his music in front of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music.  Details at Eleven.”  \r\n\r\nYou can’t buy that kind of publicity!  \r\n\r\nI would probably have had to pay a fine and spend a restless night in The Slammer.  It might have been worth every penny.  It might have been worth a night of tossing and turning on a hard cot in a noisy cell block, trying to "knit up the raveled sleave of care."\r\n\r\nI’ll never know because, in fact, I did not seize the opportunity.  It shames me to admit it, but without so much as a murmur, I complied with the officer’s request.  I put my card table and CDs in the trunk of my car and drove home.\r\n\r\nFor several years thereafter, I contented myself with vending at Findlay Market, ceasing  only when I became an art guard, a gig which required me to be present and accounted for at the Cincinnati Art Museum on Saturday mornings.\r\n\r\nMy point is that peddling one''s artistry is bewildering.  Remember the Native American described by Thoreau in Walden?  He was astonished to discover that it was not enough merely to weave beautiful baskets; now he must also entice people to buy them!\r\n\r\nI hear you saying, "So what, Sowash?  What else is new?” \r\n\r\nQuite right, too.  I don’t know what your life is like, but pretty much everything about mine is confusing.  Not least of all, words.  \r\n\r\nAfter all, the word “eroica" is just one “t" short of “erotica.”  So near and yet so far!\r\n\r\nWhen I see “art heist,” I always think, “atheist.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I see “miniseries,” I always think, “miseries.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I see “facsimile,” I always think, “sick family.”  \r\n\r\nMusic, on the other hand, never confuses me.  Not like Life.  Music is what it is.  As with  everything in the natural world, music means only itself, nothing more, nothing less.  That’s one reason we love it.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Adagio movement of my Piano Trio #5, subtitled “Eroica,” performed superbly well by my friends violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 23, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rode the bike trail to Terrace Park and back, again, yesterday.  Beautiful!\r\n\r\nAs I tooled along, I thought, “What music for bicycling?"\r\n\r\nMusic that gallops.  Bicycles don’t gallop; they glide.  But music that gallops comes close to expressing the exhilaration, the excitement of the experience.\r\n\r\nMost of the galloping music that has excited me reached my ears via film scores for great Hollywood westerns like The Magnificent Seven, How The West Was Won, The Big Country.  Also the TV westerns I grew up watching:  Wagon Train, Bonanza.  To me, that is what the music of heroic galloping sounds like.\r\n\r\nI never scored a Hollywood western.  My peculiar career has been as far removed from Hollywood as it has been from Academe.  But in the finale of my Piano Trio #5, my challenge was to find a way to incorporate the galloping excitement, the expansive textures and the adventurous spirit of the best western film scores into a work of serious, contemporary chamber music.\r\n\r\nThe result is this Presto, the final movement from my Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," in which a feeling of heroism prevails over the darker, troubled music of the earlier movements.\r\n\r\nDoes this final movement sound "too Hollywood?"  You''d never hear chamber music in a western film.  Does it express a galloping heroism, in a way that transcends Hollywood influences?  See what you think.\r\n\r\nBefore you give this music a listen I’ve a tidge more to say about bike trails.  \r\n\r\nOn nice days like yesterday in Cincinnati, The Little Miami Trail, part of the network of trails threading from the Ohio River to Lake Erie.  It''s a mere 90-second bike ride from my house.  I value that!   \r\n\r\nToday, “pert near” everybody loves bike trails.  \r\n\r\n’Twas not always so.  There was a time when the notion of converting abandoned railways to trailways was new.  For many Ohioans proposed bike trails were such stuff as nightmares are made on.\r\n\r\nBack in the mid-80’s, when I was a County Commissioner in Richland County, way up in north central Ohio, I had to fight tooth and nail to get the area’s first bike trail approved.  In public hearings the citizenry — some of whom were parents of boys who had been scouts in my troop when I was a Scoutmaster — expressed their First Amendment rights by all but spitting in my face.  They were outraged, furious.  They yelled and glaring at me with a  hatred I had never experienced … because I made bold to say that I thought a bike trail was a good idea.\r\n\r\nThey said that bicyclers would descend upon properties near the trail, not only littering, but breaking-and-entering, perpetrating burglary and rape and murder …  No one asleep in their bedroom in a house near the trail would ever sleep well again.  \r\n\r\nEven the bikers who did not go in for violent crimes would sell drugs … they would trespass … they would vandalize, spray-painting four-letter words on the sides of barns and sheds near the trail.\r\n\r\nEven the bikers who steered clear of torts and misdemeanors would poop and pee along the trail, wherever they happened to be when the urge came upon them.\r\n\r\nProperty values would plummet!  “Who would ever want to live near a bike trail?”\r\n\r\nPlus, they said, NOBODY would use it!\r\n\r\nAt one hearing, an elderly man waved his fist and shouted, to thunderous applause, “This is just like what they do in ROOSHIE, them Communists, pushin’ things down people’s throats!”\r\n\r\nThe County Auditor, an elected official mind you, owned a large property across which the trail was to pass.  He dramatized his opposition to the bike trail by hiring a construction company to bulldoze huge piles of dirt and gravel onto the abandoned railroad track where the proposed bike trail was to be.  \r\n\r\nI stuck it out and gradually Vox Populi changed its tune.  Today …. well, you can guess.\r\n\r\nI can’t take all the credit.  The Richland County bike trail would eventually have come into existence without my pushing for it.  Somebody, sooner or later, would have taken the heat and made it happen.  But I had the chance and I seized it.  I’m glad I did.  When I ride the bike trail near our present-day home, though I had nothing to do with its creation, I feel it’s a privilege I’ve earned.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the Presto from my “Eroica" trio, beautifully performed by violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),37);

Auburn Presbyterian, will put on its annual Shrove Tuesday Pancake Supper and a certain composer you know is the chef de cuisine!  A team of flapjack flippers will serve up home-made cornmeal-buttermilk pancakes alongside the best sausage to be had in Cincinnati, a city famous for its sausage.  What''s more, a Dixieland band will have us stompin'' and struttin'', throughout the evening.  We''re expecting about 200 to attend.  It''s a blast and I wish you and all my other friends and fans could be there.\r\n\r\nOne of the tunes the band will play, along with traditional New Orleans standards, will be a tune of mine, entitled "Beignets and Gelato."  It''s an homage to the Crescent City where we''ve enjoyed three week-long visits over the last four years.  We do love it so!  We long to return. Such a fun-loving, lovable city!\r\n\r\nI want you to hear my only foray into Dixieland -- in its original orchestral setting.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, the Heartland Symphony Orchestra (a spirited community orchestra serving Brainerd and Little Falls, Minnesota) commissioned me to write an orchestral suite in honor of the orchestra''s 35th anniversary.  I wrote a half-hour piece called North Country Suite which they premiered in April of 2012.  \r\n\r\nSince the Mississippi originates in northern Minnesota I decided to portray that great, vast, storied river in the suite''s third movement, entitled "Father of Waters" -- that''s what the word "Mississippi" once meant in a Native American language. \r\n\r\nThe movement begins almost inaudibly;  you won''t hear much in the first few seconds.\r\n\r\nThen come tentative, trickling fragments of tunes, an evocation of the bubbling of springs and the coalescing of little streams and creeks, already with a few jazzy "Blue" notes.  These come together in a broad, rolling theme with a distinctively American, Western feel and then, just when the movement seems to end (about three and a half minutes through), comes a surprise:  the music goes Dixieland! ... because, of course, the Mississippi culminates in "N''awlins!"  \r\n\r\nThe Dixieland music is familiar-sounding because I deliberately wrote it in a very familiar style -- but the tune is original, I assure you -- that''s my tune, "Beignets and Gelato."\r\n\r\nI even included a banjo part, hoping the orchestra could locate a banjo player.   Sure enough, at the premiere, the concert mistress'' banjo-playing father was featured, his first performance before a crowd, and looking very trim and handsome, in his tuxedo!\r\n\r\nJosh Aerie conducts the Heartland Symphony Orchestra''s  in the live, premiere performance of the "Father of Waters" movement from my North Country Suite.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nMarch 2, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAmerican place-names!  Now there’s a subject.  A careful examination of the map of Ohio — my life-long stomping ground — reveals crossroads, hamlets and villages with peculiar names.  Glandorf, Peebles, Burgoon, Overpeck, Deunquat, Pancoastburg, Tipp City, Mingo Junction, Mogadore, Fitchville, Chuckery.\r\n\r\nSome cue laughter:  Coolville, Reminderville, Outville, Celeryville, Getaway, Nellie, Big Bottom, Round Bottom, Fly, Flushing and -- best of all! -- Knockemstiff.  \r\n\r\nKnowing that such names are spread across the Buckeye State, the thoughtful Ohioan daresn''t disdain the perplexing place-names found in other states.  We must keep a straight face when our consciousness is penetrated by the likes of Gnawbone, IN, Wahoo, NE, Dimebox, TX, Rabbit Hash, KY or Podunk, CT.\r\n\r\nSome are downright oxymoronic.  Remembering Brilliant, OH, we Buckeyes must needs soft-pedal our natural astonishment when we come upon Liberal, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThere are stories behind these monikers.  In 1872, a good-hearted fellow by the name of S. S. Rogers built the first house in what would become Liberal, KS.  Rogers became famous in the region for dispensing water to weary travelers.  The commodity was precious but the generous Mr. Rogers liberally ladled the stuff of life to the longing lips of thirsty pioneers.  Expressing their thanks, grateful recipients would say, “That’s mighty liberal of you, Mr. Rogers.”  \r\n\r\nNinety-Five years before public television, Liberality was the salient feature in this particular Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThink of it!  There was a time when the word “liberal” had positive connotations.  Then, along came Eugene V. Debs, William Jennings Bryan, Dorothy Day, T.R., F.D.R., William O. Douglas, M.L. King, George McGovern, Bernie Sanders, et al.  For better or worse, they changed the connotation of the word.  Today, very few public figures dare to embrace the adjective.  Many a Conservative has gotten elected chiefly by pointing at an opponent and yelling, “Liberal!  Liberal!  Liberal!"   Especially in places like Kansas.  A recent book title rightly raised the question, “What’s the Matter with Kansas?"\r\n\r\nFor me, genuine astonishment lingers in connection with Liberal, but not because of the improbability of coming upon such a place-name in a state determinedly red as Kansas. Twenty-five years ago, having landed a gig in Liberal, I flew into Wichita, rented a car and undertook the five-hour, west-bound drive on a highway as unwaveringly straight as a Kansas politician.  \r\n\r\nParts of Ohio may seem flat.  Tain’t so.  You don’t know flatness until you drive across Kansas.  The flatness of Kansas puts the lie to all other flatnesses.  Kansas is as flat as the Earth is round.  Flat, but not without color.  The sky is a depthless blue, the endless corn is Kelly green, broken only when white grain elevators become visible, a distant fleck at first, fully five miles away, seeming to grow as approached, finally towering ten stories high.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I noticed a strange, dark smudge, just above the horizon, far, far ahead.  Like the grain elevators, it seemed to rise, slowly, as I drew nearer but it also spread, slowly, to the south and north of my ‘Westward, ho!'' highway.  \r\n\r\nInexplicably, it rippled in gentle waves, rising and falling like a long, limpid, silken scarf, unimaginably vast, undulating unnaturally in a weirdly lugubrious wind.  I could form no theory to explain what I was seeing.  Was it some bizarre phenomenon of the weather?  A meteorological secret, unique to south-central Kansas?  Could clouds execute such a vast, slow-motion dance-step?  Was I watching the birth-throes of a tornado?\r\n\r\nNo.  It was birds.  Millions upon millions of birds, migrating.  The largest throng of birds I have ever seen or will ever see, winding across the sky in silent majesty.  Silent from a distance, that is.  At length, when I was underneath them, their cries were maddeningly raucous.  The extraordinary sound, which I will never hear again, climaxed as I passed through, then faded as I passed beyond the shifting shadows cast by a quarter billion birds.  \r\n\r\nSilent once more, the undulation came into sight in my rear view mirror, falling further and further behind until becoming, again, only a strange, dark smudge ... receding, fading, shriveling, diminishing at last to the merest wisp on the horizon.  Perhaps an hour after I had first sighted it, the spectacle fell from my sight.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing.  An immense wonder, unfolding with neither prompt nor direction from human beings, simply happening, once again, as it has for thousands and thousands of years, out there in the middle of the continent, a gigantic, living, non-human event taking place, all on its own, high above the prairie.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I ever saw that could compare with it was the Northern Lights.  Like that migrating column of birds, it is something I’ve seen only once.  When I was about seven years old, my parents awakened me one midnight and carried their little, sleepy boy, wrapped in a blanket, outside, to see the Northern Lights.  Like the migration, it was another immense, unfolding wonder, happening entirely on its own, utterly indifferent to us, the little Sowash family, and thus, awe-inspiring.  Faces upturned, mouths open, hushed, we cast our eyes skyward, feeling tenderly toward one another, vulnerable and small.\r\n\r\nAt such moments, the distinctions that seem so important in common hours -- the nuanced distinctions we make between Liberal and Conservative, say -- surrender all significance.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, the Heartland Symphony Orchestra, a spirited community orchestra serving Brainerd and Little Falls, Minnesota — two more good, old, American-sounding place-names — commissioned me to write an orchestral suite in honor of the orchestra''s 35th anniversary.  I wrote a five-movement piece called North Country Suite which they premiered in April of 2012.  \r\n\r\nThe second movement, entitled “Northern Lights,” strives to express the bewildered reverence we feel at those rare moments when we confront the essential truth that only Nature can teach us:  that our brief, tiny lives are acted out upon an unutterably tremendous, unthinkably ancient, imponderably mysterious and almost inconceivably beautiful stage that is not of our making.\r\n\r\nTo hear Josh Aerie conducting the Heartland Symphony Orchestra''s premiere performance of "Northern Lights" from North Country Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 20, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nBefore I set to work, I conferred closely with Josh Aerie.  He apprised me that the orchestra was blessed with a particularly strong trumpeter, oboist, a great French horn section and an exuberant virtuoso timpanist.  Wanting the suite to begin with a bang, I wrote a first movement that prominently features those instruments.\r\n\r\nI opened with a vigorous, almost swashbuckling theme in 7/4, a meter that renders the music a little breathless, a bit off balance, like an enthusiastic amateur snow-shoer.   The music is in G minor, a key that is at once dark and joyful.\r\n\r\nThen things settle down, making way for a contrast.  A hymn-like tune is sounded, varied and developed.  The valiant opening tune returns and, voilà, the two musics are combined, the opposites reconciled.\r\n\r\nMy model for this movement was Sibelius’ Finlandia.  Sibelius being a Finn, that piece, too, has a Northern spirit, with an aggressively rhythmical figure balanced by an ardent Nordic hymn, the two contrasting musics reconciled.  \r\n\r\nSibelius is the 20th-century composer I most admire.  After years of careful listening, I remain astounded by his symphonies and tone poems.  His was a great soul and he managed to express it musically.  And in a remarkable diary entry that gives us an intimate glimpse into the spirituality of a Master.  He wrote:\r\n\r\n"In the evening, working on the symphony … which strangely enchants me.  As if God had thrown down pieces of a mosaic from the floor of heaven and asked me to work out the pattern.  Perhaps a good definition of composing.”\r\n\r\nThese words thrill me almost as much as his music.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Spirit of the North” performed by the Heartland Symphony Orchestra in their premiere performance of North Country Suite, conducted by Josh Aerie, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 9, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne advantage of growing up in Ohio is that you learn about the Moundbuilders, the ancient peoples who built Ohio''s "Indian mounds," as we used to call them.  Ohio history is taught in the fourth grader;  Ohio children  are aware that there were people here long ago.  They know American history didn''t start in 1776 or 1620 or even 1492.\r\n\r\nMay I recommend a book that opened my eyes to the astonishing breadth and depth of this subject?  \r\n\r\n1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles C. Mann. Fascinating!\r\n\r\nAt the time I read it I was writing an orchestral piece, my five-movement North Country Suite, commissioned by Minnesota''s Heartland Symphony.  It prompted me to make the fourth movement an elegy for the ancient forest that once covered all the land from what is now Minnesota to Maine.  It was the greatest hardwood forest that ever was, an unimaginably vast, living giant, all gone except for a few nail trimmings, spared only on hillsides the settlers deemed too steep for farming.  I wanted to evoke that forest and the ancient, vanished cultures that flourished in its shade.\r\n\r\nHow to express such a thing?  A query like that one sparks my creativity.\r\n\r\nThe Moundbuilders, like people everywhere, sang songs and fashioned musical instruments.  We don''t know what their music sounded like; there was no help for me from that source.  I might have studied Native American music of more recent times but that music has no connection with my experience and scant connections with the music of peoples so long forgotten.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to steer clear of the most obvious cliches: the repeated low brass "Heap Big Injun" chords and the menacing tom-toms I heard in the film scores of "Cowboy and Indian" movies I saw in my 1950''s boyhood.  (I loved them at the time!)  I seized on one cliche from those films:  parallel fifths.  You''ll hear them at the beginning and the end of this movement.  I hope I used them in a fresh way.\r\n\r\nI tried to fashion music that, for me at least, draws forth mental images of a vast, ancient, solemn forest, implicitly honoring the forgotten peoples who made it their home for thousands of years. \r\n\r\nYou can hear the movement entitled "Boreal Forest" from my North Country Suite as recorded before an audience of northern Minnesotans (please excuse an occasional cough) in its premiere performance under the baton of Josh Aerie, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a score of the movement by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 8, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when we were young and foolish, Jo and I passed a happy week in Green Lake, Wisconsin, as guests of the Green Lake Festival of Music.  I sat in on rehearsals of my music, introduced the pieces in concert and took a bow after they were played.  We were hosted by the Boismenues, a lovely couple who had a grand, old, tree-shaded lakefront home.  They had a dock … and a canoe!\r\n\r\nWe canoed every day.  Wonderful!  I’m an old hand with canoes, a master of the craft since my Boy Scouting days.  Paddle in hand, I’m confident.  Heck, I taught canoeing at Scout camp.\r\n\r\nThe idyllic week passed.  It was morning, the day of our departure.  We were to catch the 12:10 train at nearby Ripon.  The Boismenues breakfasted us amply and by mid-morning we were packed, teeth brushed, tummies full, nothing much to do.  We traded a glance:  “One more canoe outing!"\r\n\r\nAs we shoved away from the dock, the waves seemed a little higher than they had before, spouting pretty little sprays of foam.  We set out, gently nudged along by the pleasant breeze behind us.  \r\n\r\nWe quickly reached in the middle of the lake.  Beautiful!  Then we judged it was about time to head back to the Boismenues, who were to drive us to Ripon.\r\n\r\nI executed the Reverse Sweep, a classic canoe stroke, and found that I had made a 360-degree turn instead of the 180 I had intended.  Yikes!  I tried again, more cautiously.  As soon as the prow was pointed toward the Boismenue’s dock, the wind, which had picked more than a little, pushed us off course.\r\n\r\nI tried every maneuver in the Canoeing merit badge pamphlet but I could not keep that canoe pointed in the direction we wanted to go.  The wind stiffened; the sky went gray; it became downright cold.  We paddled as hard as we could, grim and silent, to no avail.  We were losing ground.  Or rather water.  We were no longer in the middle of the lake.  We were being blown to the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe wind made me think of Tall Tales.  People walking sideways so as to keep from flyin’.  Ducks winging backwards to keep from gettin’ sand in their eyes.  The county line blown ten miles east -- the county engineer had to go out and gather it up again on cable spools, bring it back and tamp it down good, so’s it wouldn’t be blown away again.\r\n\r\nIt felt like a Tall Tale but it wasn’t funny.  We were going to miss our train!.\r\n\r\nJust when all hope seemed lost (isn’t that always the way?), an angel appeared unto us.  \r\n\r\nWe did not at first realize that he was an angel because he was cleverly disguised as a pot-bellied, sunburned geezer ensconced on the poop deck of a little motor boat, one hand on the tiller, the other clasping a can of beer.  \r\n\r\nHe was, however, an angel sure enough.  He had grasped our desperate situation.  He threw us a rope and towed us back to the Boismenues, bless him.  We shouted our thanks, jumped into the waiting Boismenue’s car and caught our train with hardly a minute to spare.\r\n\r\nI remembered that little adventure when I wrote the last movement of my North Country Suite for the Heartland Symphony in north central Minnesota.  Folks up there know a thing or two about canoeing "into the wind” on Minnesota’s fabled “ten thousand lakes.”  \r\n\r\nAs you listen, imagine paddling with all your might through waves and wind, our frightened exhilaration and our lucky arrival at the Boismenue’s dock, and in the nick of time, too!

Today, the word is considered derogatory because it was assigned by non-Inuit people and was said to mean ''eater of raw meat.''  President Obama signed legislation that replaced the term with "Alaska Native" in federal laws.\r\n\r\nI don’t wish to offend, but since the re-evaluation of the label was still in the future at the time my story unfolds, please allow me to use the word here.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1950’s, the Eskimos who populated my world were made of soft gray molding clay.  I passed many happy hours fashioning them myself.  I wrapped each little Eskimo’s ball-of-clay right hand around a sewing needle so that they would look like they were holding a spear.  I rolled a lump of clay into a sausage shape with pointy ends to make a kayak, poking a hole in the middle in which an Eskimo could sit.  I rolled the clay into a sphere and sliced it in half to make two igloos.  \r\n\r\nI tried to make polar bears and walruses but, try as I might, the creatures I made looked too human, which was creepy.  Too much clay was required to make a whale so I stuffed a t-shirt inside a gray woolen stocking to serve as my Moby.  \r\n\r\n"Moby Sock!”  All it took was a little imagination!\r\n\r\nI loved Eskimos but I hated TV dinners.  I had to eat TV dinners when my parents went out for the evening, leaving me behind, baby-sat by my cousin Barbie, whom they instructed to heat a TV dinner in the oven and serve it to me for supper.  Turkey and dressing with peas in an aluminum tray.  Yuck.  \r\n\r\nI resented my parents’ excursions mainly because, though I liked Barbie, it was insulting to be left in the care of a baby sitter.  I gave vent to my resentment by railing against the TV dinners. \r\n\r\nThen one afternoon my father explained to me that he and my mother would be dining out that evening but that, this time, my cousin Barbie was going to prepare a very special TV dinner for me:  whale meat and tundra.\r\n\r\n“Tundra?” I asked.  “What’s tundra?”\r\n\r\n“It’s what Eskimos eat, alongside whale meat and peas,” my father explained.\r\n\r\nCool!  I was fascinated and, for once, very eager to eat a TV dinner.  When Barbie placed the flimsy aluminum tray of hot food in front of me, I examined the contents, carefully and appreciatively.  \r\n\r\nTrue, it looked exactly the same as the other TV dinners I had eaten.  The meat had the same pale gray-beige color as sliced turkey and the tundra looked just like the bland dressing to which I was accustomed.  As for the peas, well, peas are peas.  No difference there.\r\n\r\nThe whale meat tasted just like turkey.  Who knew?  My friend Larry Palmer claimed to have eaten fried rattlesnake.  He said it tasted like chicken.  So I wasn’t surprised to find that whale meat tasted like turkey.  It made sense.   And the tundra tasted just like dressing!  No matter.  It was Eskimo food!  I loved it!\r\n\r\nFrom then on, when I learned my parents were going out, I eagerly anticipated another ‘Whale Meat & Tundra with Peas’ TV dinner.  I took it to be a standard item in the Swanson’s line.\r\n\r\nThen came 7th grade and Mr. Beale’s Geography class.  We were studying the Arctic.  Mr. Beale described ‘the tundra.’  He said it was a vast, flat, treeless region where the soil is permanently frozen. \r\n\r\nI raised my hand.\r\n\r\n“You know,” I ventured, “you can eat that tundra.  The Eskimos serve it alongside whale meat and peas.  It’s not bad.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beale was taken aback.  He scrutinized my face, trying to determine my motive in making this unexpected announcement.  He saw that I was in earnest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, is that right?” he said, tenuously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” I replied.  “I’ve had it lots of times.”\r\n\r\n“So I suppose you’ve eaten whale meat, too, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.  It tastes a lot like turkey.  It’s one of Swanson’s TV dinners.”\r\n\r\nSome of my classmates permitted themselves a cautious chuckle.  Mr. Beale, frozen by my assertion, blinked his eyes several times, then smirked. \r\n\r\n“This is,” he said in a doubtful tone, “something of which I have not heard.  Be that as it may …”  And he continued the lesson.\r\n\r\nI was indignant.  When I got home I demanded that my mother make haste to the nearest Kroger’s and purchase said TV dinner so that I could take it to class in triumph and deliver my chuckling classmates and the skeptical Mr. Beale their comeuppance.\r\n\r\nShe had to explain.  They had only meant to make it a little more fun for me to eat the turkey and dressing TV dinners when they were out.  She said she was sorry they hadn’t gotten round to telling me the truth of the matter.\r\n\r\nThis information induced several emotions in me.  Not least was my disappointment that I would never again eat turkey and dressing under the false impression that it was whale meat and tundra.  It had been a culinary adventure.  I had relished it.\r\n\r\nOh, well.  It was one of the costs of growing up.\r\n\r\nWith the Antipodal regions fresh in our minds, let’s listen to “Spirit of the North,” the first movement of my North Country Suite, commissioned by the Heartland Symphony Orchestra of Brainerd, MN.  \r\n\r\nThe tunes have a Nordic character but what I like best is the timpani part and how the timpanist makes the most of the opportunities I gave her.  She really takes charge and means business, like one of my clay Eskimos in a clay kayak, armed with a sewing needle, on the hunt for "Moby Sock."\r\n\r\nTo hear their premiere performance, under the direction of Maestro Josh Aerie, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),137);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(13,replace(replace('My Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano was written in 2003 for les Gavottes, French musicians who have played and recorded my music with great sensitivity and enthusiasm.  \r\n\r\nOriginally, I subtitled this trio "Nous Chantions, Nous Dansions" which translates as "We Used to Sing, We Used to Dance."  That''s a little awkward in English, so I simplified it to: "We Sang, We Danced."  But it doesn''t mean quite the same thing.  "We used to sing, we used to dance" is a little wistful, something we might say with a sad smile and a sigh for the good old days ... that is what the trio’s Tango movement attempts to express. \r\n\r\nIt is, however, a fiction.  The truth is, I''ve never danced a Tango in my life.  I am not and will never be a person who can look back on the days when I used to go Tango dancing.  Sigh. Such a beautiful thing, the Tango, a little sentimental, a little over the top.  In the end, the piece is about my imagining what it might be like to look back and remember having sung and danced the night away, back in the long-lost days of our Youth.\r\n\r\nI must admit, however, that even as I write those words, they seem faintly ridiculous.  Well, so is this Tango, I admit.  Occasionally, I''ve attempted to write music that hovers on the very line that separates an homage from a parody.  This Tango is one such instance.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear this Tango, I wonder what you''ll think?  Will you hear it as a loving homage to a marvelous genre? or will you think that I''m parodying the Tango?  Is it possible for music to be both an homage and a parody?\r\n\r\nSee what you think.  \r\n\r\nI have never heard this trio performed live.  Les Gavottes dis-assembled before they were able to perform it.  It has only been performed in public twice and I was not able to attend either concert.  The mp3 that is ''linked'' below features the premiere, recorded at a home concert in the Manhattan apartment of my clarinetist friend Joe Rosen, sixty floors above Broadway, playing with his friends Adiel Shmit on cello and Taisiya Pushkar, piano.  The technical quality is only adequate, but I think you''ll find that the enthusiasm of the musicians more than compensates.\r\n\r\nTo hear the "Tango" movement from my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, performed by Joe Rosen and friends, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nMarch 9, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nBefore Thomas Hart Benton put paint to canvas, he rendered in clay the scene he planned to depict, sculpting the figures, the hills, even the trees and the clouds.  He began to paint only when the clay diorama was complete, using it as a three-dimensional model, noting how the shadows fell.  When the painting was finished, he destroyed the model, reusing the clay in preparation for his next painting.\r\n\r\nKnowing his approach gives us a peek into his studio; it partially explains the peculiar muscularity of his figures, his oddly anthropomorphic trees, his sinuous clouds.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, I have often employed a similar technique though less deliberately, less systematically. \r\n\r\nI will set a poem to music, expressing the poet''s words and images musically, matching the contour and rhythms of the melody to the rise and fall, the rhythms and the meanings of the words, transforming the poem from something read on a page into something to be sung.  \r\n\r\nThen, sometimes years later, the song grows into a larger instrumental work.  Though the words are removed, the rise and fall, the rhythms, the wisdom or whimsy of the poem remain, rendered non-specific, left undefined.\r\n\r\nMusicians and listeners often comment on the ‘lyrical’ quality of my instrumental works, little guessing that the music began life as a song with lyrics, just as Benton’s paintings were realized from a model he first sculpted in clay.  \r\n\r\nThe first movement of my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “We Sang, We Danced,” began as a setting of a poem entitled “The Picture” by Frederick Sylvester.\r\n\r\nThe Picture -- by Frederick Sylvester\r\n\r\n			“There’s a pool in the ancient forest,”\r\n				The painter-poet said,\r\n			“That is violet-blue and emerald\r\n				From the face of the sky o’erhead.”\r\n\r\n			So far in the ancient forest,\r\n				To the heart of the wood went I,\r\n			But found no pool of emerald,\r\n				No violet-blue for sky.\r\n\r\n			“There’s a pool in the ancient forest,”\r\n				Said the painter-poet still.\r\n			“That is violet-blue and emerald,\r\n				Near the breast of a rose-green hill.”\r\n\r\n			And the heart of the ancient forest\r\n				The painter-poet drew,\r\n			And painted a pool of emerald\r\n				That thrilled me through and through.\r\n	\r\n			Then back to the ancient forest\r\n				I went with a strange, wild thrill,\r\n			And I found the pool of emerald\r\n				Near the breast of a rose-green hill.\r\n\r\nI’m not quite sure what the poem means.  Maybe it''s a parable about the power of the arts to enhance our perception.  \r\n\r\nI set it to music for soprano and piano, later expanding it and re-scoring it for clarinet, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nThe movement begins with the cello alone, arpeggiating lovely chords.  When the clarinet finally enters it is “singing” the first line of the poem and, though the rest of the piece strays from the poem, you’ll hear its rhythm and feel its mysterious energy throughout.\r\n\r\nVery few have heard this music; the work is rarely performed and does not appear on my CDs.  The only recording features my friend, the NYC clarinetist, Joe Rosen playing it with his friends in his living room on the 60th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper.\r\n\r\nTake a peek into that living room and watch Amy Gurowitz’ short film, “Sowash on the 60th Floor,” featuring Joe and friends performing the last movement of the work, my only tango, by copying and pasting the next line into your browser.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ-D1TVnnMc&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nTo hear the opening movement, “Prelude," from my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “We Sang, We Danced,” performed by clarinetist Joe Rosen, cellist Adiel Shmit and pianist Taisiya Pushkar, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOnce again, right now, if you can spare 2-and-a-half minutes, you can hear music that almost no one has heard.\r\n\r\nThe only people who have heard this music are the twenty friends of clarinetist Joe Rosen who gathered in his Manhattan apartment for “a home concert” where Joe featured and recorded my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “We Sang, We Danced.”\r\n\r\nToday, I’m inviting you to listen to the third movement, which sings.  \r\n\r\nConsider:  music leans in one of two directions:  toward singing or toward dancing.  Singing music puts the emphasis on the melody, the tune.  Dancing music puts the emphasis on the rhythm, the beat.\r\n\r\nThe design of this four-movement work is:  the first and last movements dance, the inner movements sing. \r\n\r\nIn the third movement, the clarinet and cello do the singing.  The piano is assigned a strange role; she is the interrupter.  She interrupts the singing with strange, short, stinging gestures that slash incisively, surgically, into the melody played by the other two instruments.  \r\n\r\nThe movement opens with that slashing piano gesture.  Let’s look at it, closely.  Consider four notes of a rising chromatic scale; that’s musical jargon for a series of notes rising by half-steps, followed by those same four notes played in reverse.  So it’s up-and-back, one time, very quickly, with the last note being allowed to “sound,” i.e., to keep ringing even as it fades, as only a piano can do.\r\n\r\nNow consider that alternating notes among those four notes are displaced an octave distant from one another.  The gesture is to be played as rapidly as possible, marked secco in the score, meaning “dry”, making a dissonant, almost avant garde sound, very rarely heard in my conservative music.  (I’m politically liberal, musically conservative.)\r\n\r\nThis strange piano gesture is immediately followed by the lovely singing of the other two instruments.\r\n\r\nWhat’s going on here?  Contrast.\r\n\r\nThink of the piano’s gesture as the seasoning, the salt, pepper, herbs and spice that we set out on the counter as we prepare a creamy soup.  \r\n\r\nAfter the piano interrupts the singing clarinet and cello with this same gesture five times, you start to accept it.  You categorize it as something alien, something thrown into the mix, something opposed and un-blendable with what the other instruments are doing.  \r\n\r\nBut listen!  When the piano plays the gesture for the sixth time it plays slightly more slowly than before, the seventh time more slowly yet.  And the notes, the eighth time, are no longer chromatic but rather diatonic, rising by half and whole steps within the B flat major scale in which the other two have been playing.  \r\n\r\nThe last time the piano makes this gesture, at the very end of the movement, it is played slowly, and the notes all arise from the tonic chord, a B flat major chord with an added 6th to make the soup creamier yet.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened?  The salt, pepper, herbs and spice have blended, after all, into the creamy soup the clarinet and cello have been simmering for us.  As the piece unfolded, the piano, at first as far removed as possible from the other two instrument, gradually advanced toward them and finally joined them, you see?  \r\n\r\nDissonant, dry and rapid through the first two-thirds of the movement, seeming permanently aloof, the piano gradually transforms, blends, as if accepting an invitation to befriend the other instruments, to learn to speak their language, to commingle like seasoning in a soup.\r\n\r\nThus, the movement ends satisfyingly.  A metaphor, if you like, for seasoning a soup, for a reconciliation of opposites, for interaction among humans.  \r\n\r\nOr, if you prefer, you can think of it as “just” music.\r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement, “A Pretty Air," from my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, “We Sang, We Danced,” performed by clarinetist Joe Rosen, cellist Adiel Shmit and pianist Taisiya Pushkar, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n"Trio # ELEVEN?” you gasp.  “R.S. wrote ELEVEN trios for clarinet, cello and piano?”\r\n\r\nYes.  In fact, I wrote THIRTEEN, numbered, multi-movement works for that marvelous combination of instruments, plus two more that are not numbered (one is the single-movement “View from Carew” and the other is a version of my cello concerto scored for just those three instruments).\r\n\r\nWhy?  I was inspired by the interest the French trio ''les Gavottes'' had shown in discovering my work.  I wrote almost all my works for that combination under the impression that, sooner or later, ‘les Gavottes'' would perform and possibly record them.  They did perform and record the first three, and very beautifully.  But not long after, the trio ‘divorced’ and went their separate ways.\r\n\r\nSome of the trios I wrote for ‘les Gavottes’ have since been professionally recorded by other musicians but numbers #11, 12 and 13 exist, as yet, only in ‘living room’ recordings.  Who knows?  Maybe they’ll be recorded some day.  Maybe not.  I don’t worry about it.  It’s in God’s hands, a way of saying that it’s not in MY hands.  \r\n\r\n(When you stop to think about, very little is ‘in OUR hands.’  Nothing at all, really.  What would it even be?  Whether or not to reheat my coffee in the microwave?  Who knows?  I might drop dead of a heart attack halfway between my easy chair and the kitchen.)\r\n\r\nThe movement from Trio #11 I hope you will permit me to share with you today began, as has been the case with so much of my instrumental music, as a song, a setting to music of words for voice and piano.\r\n\r\nThe text is a poem from the Irish-born writer James Joyce’s early work, “Chamber Music.”  (That will be the only reference to Irish culture in this message.  I am well aware that today is St. Patrick’s Day and I give it a hearty nod.  But I’m just not Irish.  You don''t hear much about the O’Sowashes.)\r\n\r\nHere’s the poem:\r\n\r\nFrom dewy dreams, my soul, arise,\r\nFrom love''s deep slumber and from death,\r\nFor lo! the trees are full of sighs\r\nWhose leaves the morn admonisheth.\r\n \r\nEastward the gradual dawn prevails\r\nWhere softly-burning fires appear,\r\nMaking to tremble all those veils\r\nOf grey and golden gossamer.\r\n \r\nWhile sweetly, gently, secretly,\r\nThe flowery bells of morn are stirred\r\nAnd the wise choirs of faery\r\nBegin (innumerous!) to be heard.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, yes.  Explicit, no.  What is it about?  Dawn.  That much is clear.  But what is “love’s deep slumber?”  A lovely phrase, but what does it mean?  Are those grey and golden veils clouds or foliage or both?  Are the “bells of morn” bird calls?  What are we to make of “the wise choirs of faery”?  Again, a gorgeous phrase, but ….\r\n\r\nThis poem, for me, “means” in much the same way that music “means.”  It’s a vague incantation, not a recipe or a road map.  The feeling of the poem is important, not the logic, and the words are merely a way of evoking a particular feeling, just as notes of music, beautifully played, can do.\r\n\r\nIn this movement the clarinet and the cello entwine intimately, tenderly, like impassioned lovers embracing in a hushed, secret, shadowy place.  The piano is NOT one of the lovers here;  it is merely the setting in which the two lovers find themselves.  That is why the instrument is given relatively little to do.  If this were a love scene in a play, the piano would be the canvas backdrop behind the intertwined actors.\r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement, “Bells of Morn," from my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, subitled “We Sang, We Danced,” beautifully performed by clarinetist Joe Rosen, cellist Adiel Shmit and pianist Taisiya Pushkar, as recorded in Joe’s living room, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nA tango by Rick Sowash?  Why not?\r\n\r\nWritten for French musician friends, my Trio #11 for Clarinet, Cello & Piano is subtitled, "Nous Chantions, Nous Dansions.”  \r\n\r\nTranslation: "We Used to Sing, We Used to Dance.”  \r\n\r\nThat''s a little awkward in English, so I simplified it to: "We Sang, We Danced."  But it doesn''t mean quite the same thing.  When we say "We used to do something,” we sound wistful, heaving a sigh or two for the good old days … that is what this music attempts to convey. \r\n\r\nIt is, however, a fiction.  The truth is, I''ve never danced a Tango in my life.  I am not and will never be a person who can look back on an earlier time when Tango dancing was part of my life.  Sigh.  Such a beautiful thing, a little sentimental, a little over the top.  But not for the likes of me.  \r\n\r\nI once had a friend who went salsa dancing most Friday nights and not with her husband.  The undersigned would never do such a thing.  I was always “a good boy.”  To a fault, perhaps.  I can’t help it.  It’s my nature.  We are who we are.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the piece is an imagining of what it would be like to be able to look back and remember having danced and sung the night away.\r\n\r\nI must admit, however, that even as I write those words, they seem faintly ridiculous.  Well, so is this Tango; I admit that as well.  Occasionally, I''ve attempted to write music that hovers on the very line that separates an homage from a parody.

Mary’s lively and gracious manner, her delightful sense of humor and her ardent love of classical music has inspired everyone who crosses her path.  \r\n\r\nIn 1979, Mary took ill and was absent from work for six weeks.  I wrote this piece for her as a musical “get-well card."  I engaged some musicians from the Ohio State University Music Dept. to record the work; we then broadcast it on WOSU-FM while Mary listened at home.   \r\n\r\nThe opening movement is brisk and flirtatious, a breath of fresh air for an invalid.\r\n\r\nListen for the wonderfully agile and expressive playing of clarinetist Michelle Gingras and flutist Betty Douglas and the other musicians -- all Cincinnatians -- violinists: Kris Frankenfeld and Elizabeth Steva, violist Dorotea Vismara Hoffman and cellist Ellen Shertzer.  I was fortunate to have enlisted such fine players to make this recording and to have the skillful assistance of John Burgess, Cincinnati''s finest recording engineer.\r\n\r\nWe recorded it in the chapel of Hyde Park United Methodist Church which is ensconced on the church''s wooded campus, a park-like setting.  Before the recording session, I helped John Burgess unload his equipment, making several trips back and forth, from his van to the chapel, with my arms full of microphone stands, headphones, control panels, etc.  \r\n\r\nThen, returning to the van for yet another load, I found him handing me two pots.  \r\n\r\n"Are you going to heat up some soup?" I asked, puzzled.  \r\n\r\n"No," he replied, "those are for the birds."  \r\n\r\n"Birds?"  \r\n\r\n"Yes.  The chapel is surrounded by trees and birds perch in them.  The microphones pick up their tweets, so they have to be chased away.  It''s no use yelling at them or throwing stones. The only thing that drives them away is for someone to go out under the trees bang pots together, real loud."\r\n\r\nWell, you see what’s coming.  An hour later the musicians were seated in front of their music stands, sawing away, and John was sitting in the back, headphones on, tweaking knobs. Suddenly, "Tweet!  tweet!"  Can''t have tweets on a recording!  \r\n\r\nWhose job was it, do you suppose, to run around the chapel, banging pots together?  Mine, of course.  Such is the glamorous life of a composer who produces his own recordings. \r\n\r\nTo hear the "Overture" from my Serenade for Mary, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nChief Composer and Pot-Banger\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nMarch 30, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nMary has been among y’all, the recipients of my weekly emails, beginning with the first one I sent to a handful of friends and fans back in October of 2013.  \r\n\r\nTwo months ago she sent us a Christmas card in which she kindly expressed her appreciation for these e-pistles, expressing herself with a writer’s flair.  She wrote, \r\n\r\n	"You pique my interest, pluck my heart strings and please my ear every Sunday morning.”\r\n\r\nWell said, Mary!  And thank you, from the heart, for the sincere interest you’ve long shown in my curious career and life’s work.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Lullaby from Serenade for Mary played with wit and verve by clarinetist Michelle Gingras, flutist Betty Douglas, violinists Kris Frankenfeld and Elizabeth Steva, violist Dorotea Vismara Hoffman and cellist Ellen Shertzer, (the musicians who recorded it on my CD entitled “Serenade”), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nMy five-movement “Serenade for Mary,” is an affectionate homage to my friend, mentor and erstwhile boss, Mary Hoffman.  She was the Music Director at WOSU-FM, Columbus’ classical music radio station, when I was a broadcaster there in the late 1970’s.\r\n\r\nFour of the five movements portray Mary Hoffman’s personality but the fourth movement, “Spiritus Maria,” is about that other Mary, the Mary of all Marys, the First of the Faithful, the mother of Jesus.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up Lutheran and having been an active member of Cincinnati’s Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church for the past twenty years, I can attest that Protestants are pretty much at liberty to draw their own conclusions about Mary.  Free of the weight of dogma, we Protestants consider ourselves to be free to choose whether or not and, if so, how to welcome the spirit of Mary, the “Spiritus Maria."\r\n\r\nFor me and, I suspect, for many progressive Christians, Mary brings pathos to the Jesus tale, personifying a nurturing femininity and a sense of what is sacred, a reminder of our very real and very fragile Mother Earth, taking her rightful place alongside the Trinity.\r\n\r\nBecause the Gospels provide so few details about her, we are at liberty to try to imagine what the mother of Jesus would have felt as the events of his short life unfolded and to try to imagine what we would feel, or to remember what we have felt, when the circumstances of our lives might be, or have already been, similar to those of Mary''s life.\r\n\r\nHistorian Will Durant wrote that, next to Jesus, Mary is the most touching figure in the New Testament.  We imagine her rearing her first-born "through all the painful joys of motherhood, proud of his youthful learning, wondering later at his doctrines and his claims, wishing to withdraw him from the exciting throng of his followers and bring him back to the healing quiet of his home . . . helplessly witnessing his crucifixion, and receiving his body into her arms . . .”\r\n\r\nWhat music for such a figure?  Across the span of five decades of writing music, the act of asking questions like that one has prompted inspiration, eventually leading to a finished piece of music.\r\n\r\nThe movement I titled “Spiritus Maria" begins with hushed strings and a French horn intoning chord progressions that arch upward like stained glass windows in a Gothic cathedral.  This is intended to be sacred music, to evoke what we feel when we regard that which is holy.  \r\n\r\n58 seconds into the movement, the oboe enters with a lilting tune, like a soothing lullaby, offering comfort, charming us with its earnest innocence, its purity of intent.  \r\n\r\nAt 2:13 the hushed chord progression that opened the movement returns,  signaling that the movement carries its message via the simplest of musical forms:  A - B - A.   It is a simplicity that befits Mary.  Or so it seemed to me, when I wrote this music almost forty years ago.\r\n\r\nTo hear Spiritus Maria, the fourth movement from my Serenade for Mary, performed by the Clermont Philharmonic under the direction of Jaime Morales, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),41);

Listen the opening movement of my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano.  It’s the second of thirteen trios I wrote for three French musicians who call themselves "les Gavottes."  I entitled the trio "Enchantement d''avril" (Enchantment of April) because the movements are expansions of songs I had written earlier, setting to music a scene from Elizabeth von Arnim''s novel, "The Enchanted April."  \r\n\r\nYou probably haven''t read the novel;  it''s not very well known; but you may remember the 1993 film Enchanted April, based on the novel.  It''s one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nIf you haven''t read the book or seen the film, well, you certainly know what April is about.\r\n\r\nApril is majestic and miraculous, a kingly re-birth, a meteorological High Renaissance. Accordingly, the movement begins (and ends) with a majestic fanfare; then a rising, trilling clarinet bridges us to a livelier music, though contemplative and pastoral.  Think of this music as a painting, a landscape; soft sheets of gray rain slant across the greening, breeze-tossed branches of trees; clusters of daffodils, gloriously white and yellow, dapple the foreground.\r\n\r\nThe music is in B flat major.  How could it not be?  Such a bright and brassy yellow key!  \r\nwith glimmering highlights of purest white.  At least that''s how B flat major seems to me.  \r\n\r\nYes, I''m one of those for whom keys have colors -- except for C major, which is colorless, clear. F major is pale green.  G major is Kelly green.  E major is bright red.  A major is pale orange while F sharp minor is a gnarled brown.  E flat major is bright blue while E flat minor is deep indigo.  A flat major is purple, F minor even moreso.  And so on ....\r\n\r\nHere then is my April music, cast in B flat major.\r\n\r\nTo hear "les Gavottes" play the opening movement of Trio #2 “Enchantment of April,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 6, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nListen to the closing movement of my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Enchantment of April.”  \r\n\r\nWritten specifically for three French musicians who call themselves "les Gavottes,” the music was intended to have a French inflection.  I think it could serve as the film score for one of those sweet, little French movies, shot in Paris, about shy people falling in love.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, les Gavottes took to this music because, they told me, it sounded so American!  I remember Lucien, the clarinetist, saying, as we listened to their recording of the work, “This part always makes me think of the American West!”, pantomiming a galloping cowboy, reins in one hand, waving an imaginary hat with the other.  I laughed with him, but what I hear is the French influence.  I guess the music is best described as Franco-American.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with the French language when I was 20, the result of an intense, summer-long affair — a ten-week immersion course at Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nLike any twenty-something, I yearned to visit Paris.  But as the years passed, other priorities forestalled the dream.  College, career, children, mortgage payments, the usual stuff.\r\n\r\nThen one day (as storytellers say), I received a letter from a Parisian clarinetist, Jean-Noel Martin, requesting the sheet music for works he’d heard on a CD recording of my music which he’d found at a Paris record store.  Remember record stores?\r\n\r\nI sent him the scores for free and we became pen-pals.  I''d write to him in French; he''d reply in English, both of us practicing our second languages.  This was before e-mail.  Remember letters?\r\n\r\nAfter two years he invited me to come over.  I was thrilled!  Jean-Noel met me at Charles DeGaulle airport and squired me back to his tiny apartment to show me how things worked there.  He moved out, lodged with a friend during my eleven-day visit, letting me use his flat.  All for free.  Un vrai ami!\r\n\r\nHis apartment was tiny; the bed occupied two-thirds of the floor space.  It was on the fifth floor of one of those classic old Parisian apartment buildings.  There was no elevator.  The toilet-closet was down the hall, shared with the floor’s other tenants.  The hallway light switch was timed to turn itself off after 90 seconds;  unless you could find a light switch again, you made the return journey from the toilet-closet in pitch darkness.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment had a tiny sink, a two-burner hot plate, a refrigerator the size of a waste-basket, a tiny desk, and book shelves on every inch of the walls.  Its one window, viewless, looked out only upon the building’s opposite wing.  I loved everything about it! \r\n\r\nI didn’t see much of Jean-Noel after the first day;  he had his job, lessons to teach, rehearsals to attend.  In two or three brief rendezvous, he gave me written lists of suggested activities and sites to visit with directions, things to seek out, notice, appreciate.\r\n\r\nEvery day, I walked and walked and walked, exploring as many neighborhoods as possible.  I was 41 by that time, but in good shape.  Even so, there were afternoons when my tired legs forced me back to the apartment, just to put up my feet and rest, poring over guide books the while.\r\n\r\nParis was marvelous, exhilarating.  The architecture, cafés, parks, museums, monuments, people, the Métro, the beautiful language.  Things ‘clicked’ for me, dozens of times, every day.  I stumbled upon a street named the Rue Nicot.  A little sign explained that it was named for Jean Nicot who introduced tobacco to the French, presenting it to the queen mother, Catherine de Medici, a cure for her migraines.  Fashionable people took up the practice and Nicot became a celebrity.  Thus originated the word ... “nicotine.”\r\n\r\nI’ve always hated smoking, but this was fascinating.  it’s one example of how my understanding of things large and small was expanded by a myriad of minute discoveries made daily in Paris.\r\n\r\nI became obsessed with a desire to return … and I’ve managed to get back to France seven times since that first visit in 1991.  Sometimes alone, sometimes with wife and children, sometimes with friends.  \r\n\r\nLa Belle France has enriched my life, immensely.  And inspired me, too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my affection and gratitude is expressed in this Franco-American music.

Upon waking, I remember little about them but I know that they have done their work.  They have re-knitted my consciousness, presented my waking mind with a refreshed perspective.  They have assured me that I am loved, that there is a Force at work that cares about me, keeps me balanced.\r\n\r\nOften, I dream of rain.  The kids are little again and we''re back in our house in Gambier, where we lived from 1988 to 1994, the happiest period of our lives (though our present life is a close second).  It’s very good to be there but it is raining and water is coming through the ceiling of a room I rarely visit.  (it’s not a real room; it exists only in my dream; it was not an actual room in our Gambier house.)  \r\n\r\nThe room contains thousands of books on shelves and on display, as in a public library or bookstore.  They are books which I seem to own but which have not yet read.  I look at the covers, the titles, the authors’ names and I am intrigued.  I want to read these books!  \r\n\r\nI am anxious to know if the books are being damaged by the incoming rain water.  Perhaps they are, perhaps they are not.  It’s never clear.  Then I awake, unsure whether it was a good dream or a bad dream, but relieved to know that, either way, that “it was all just a dream.”\r\n\r\nSomething of the spirit of this recurring dream is captured in Walter de la Mare’s lovely, mysterious poem, “Rain.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI woke in the swimming dark\r\nAnd heard, now sweet, now shrill,\r\nThe voice of the rain-water,\r\n	Cold and still,\r\n\r\nEndlessly sing; now faint,\r\nIn the distance borne away;\r\nNow in the air float near,\r\n	But nowhere stay;\r\n\r\nSinging I know not what,\r\nEchoing on and on;\r\nFollowing me in sleep,	\r\n	Till night was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nI set these lovely words to music for mezzo Diane Haslam plus a flute and a piano.  She sang it so beautifully; alas, we never recorded her rendition.\r\n\r\nTo hear another fine mezzo, Susan Olson, singing “Rain" from Silvery Songs (I regret I did not note the names of the flutist or pianist who performed with her and so cannot acknowledge them), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nLater, I expanded this song into the opening movement of my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Enchanted April."\r\n\r\nTo hear "les Gavottes" play the opening movement of Trio #2 “Enchantment of April,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nAt long last ...

What would she see out of her window?  A shining world, or a world of rain?  But it would be beautiful; whatever it was would be beautiful.\r\n\r\n	She lay putting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off opening a precious letter, gloating over it.  She had no idea what time it was.  No sounds were to be heard in the house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she had slept a long while -- so completely rested, so perfectly content.  She lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she was, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile.  In bed by herself -- adorable condition.  The cool roominess of it, the freedom of one’s movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving the blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more comfortable!  It was like the discovery of an entirely new joy.\r\n\r\n	Mrs. Wilkins longed to get up and open the shutters, but where she was was really so very delicious.  She gave a sigh of contentment, and went on lying there looking round her, taking in everything in her room, her own little room, her very own to arrange just as she pleased.    \r\n\r\n	Well, this was delicious, to lie there thinking how happy she was, but outside those shutters it was more delicious still.  She jumped up, pulled on her slippers, ran to the windows and threw open the shutters.\r\n\r\n	“Oh!” cried Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n	All the radiance of April in Italy lay gathered together at her feet.  The sun poured in on her.  The sea lay asleep in it, hardly stirring.  Across the bay the lovely mountains, exquisitely different in color, were asleep too in the light, and underneath her window, the bottom of the flower-starred grass slope, from which the wall of the castle sprung up, was a great cypress, cutting through the delicate blues and violets and rose colors of the mountains and the sea.\r\n\r\n	She stared.  Such beauty and she there to see it.  Such beauty and she alive to feel it.  Her face was bathed in light.  How beautiful, how beautiful.  Not to have died before this.  To have been allowed to see, breathe, feel this.  She stared, her lips parted. Happy?  Poor, ordinary, everyday word.  But what could she say, how could one describe it?  It was as though she could hardly stay inside herself, it was as though she were too small to hold so much of joy, it was as though she were washed through with light.”\r\n\r\nI set to music the words of that last paragraph, making them into a song for mezzo Diane Haslam to sing.  And did she ever.  Gorgeous!  She melted our hearts.  I sigh, remembering that performance.\r\n\r\nLater, I expanded the song into the slow movement of my second clarinet/cello/piano trio, written for my French musician friends Lucien Aubert, Francois Adloff and Jean Tatu, who called their trio “les Gavottes."\r\n\r\nThis music expresses, I think, a little of the quiet, subdued wonder of awakening in a new and beautiful place.  It’s neo-Romantic and the most beautiful music ever to flow from who-knows-where through me and onto the page.\r\n\r\nAs you listen, follow the words of the last of the paragraphs I quoted from the novel, the one beginning, “She stared.”  You''ll hear the clarinet “singing” and ornamenting the text.  \r\n\r\n“She stared … Such beauty … and she there to see it …” \r\n\r\nTo hear les Gavottes’ exquisite performance of the 2nd movement from my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano:  “Enchantment of April,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 5, 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nI fell in love with French when I was 20.  \r\n\r\nIt was an intense, summer-long affair.  \r\n\r\nDon’t get me wrong!  \r\n\r\nI refer to a ten-week summer course at Ohio State University into which I threw myself, heart and soul.

Right away, I knew it was a keeper -- simple and heartfelt, like the best old American hymn tunes.\r\n\r\nWhen I sang it for Jo that evening, she said, "That''s in your Grandma Moses style."\r\n\r\nShe was referring to a music critic who had recently quipped:  "Sowash has a unique style which I can only describe by saying that if Grandma Moses composed music, I think this is what it would sound like."\r\n\r\nWe laugh about it though I''ve never been sure if he intended the comparison as a compliment or a jibe.\r\n\r\nI like Grandma Moses'' paintings just fine.  I might have preferred a comparison to Grant Wood or Thomas Hart Benton, but Grandma Moses was true to her vision and possessed an instantly recognizable American style.  I hope the same might be said of my best work.\r\n\r\nFor my own amusement, I wrote a set of variations on the tune, easy enough for me to play on the recorder, titling it "Variations on a Tune by Grandma Moses."  The tune being hymn-like, I set up my music stand in the center aisle of my church one Sunday morning and played the piece as an Offertory.\r\n\r\nThen I thought I should find some words to sing with this tune so that it could serve as a hymn. I found a versified setting of Psalm 23 that fell into place with the music.  Then I expanded the hymn into an anthem for four-part choir and piano titled, "Emerald Fields."\r\n\r\nIn the process, I cooked up a few more variations and re-scored the Grandma Moses Variations, first for solo clarinet and then for that noblest of instruments, the cello.  Because I can''t play any stringed instruments, I always send my cello scores to my old friend Terry King, requesting his suggestions.  He always delivers.  With Terry''s help, I soon had a fine set of cello variations, ready to share with any cellist who might be interested.  But Terry said, "You shouldn''t call this piece ''Grandma Moses Variations.''  Your music may have some traits in common with her work, but she was a primitive and you are not."\r\n\r\nTerry is always right.  Thinking about the hymn setting and the anthem and my having played the tune on my recorder during a worship service, I re-named the expanded piece, "Sunday Morning Variations."  Then I sent a PDF of the score to all my cellist friends.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Suzanne Mueller, kindly included her rendition of the piece on her CD, Solitaire. She sent the CD to America''s classical music radio stations and I''ll bet they are broadcasting it on Sunday mornings!\r\n\r\nTo hear Suzanne playing my Sunday Morning Variations, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 13, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morning, something different.\r\n\r\nFor reasons explained below, I’m inviting you to view a 4-minute clip from “Old Gringo,” one of Gregory Peck’s last films.\r\n\r\nHis manner and look, his speech and delivery are wonderful.   Oddly, the film, as a whole, fails and I can''t recommend it.  But this one scene … ah!  I’ve viewed it a hundred times. Copy and paste this link into your browser:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXHiDsQYt6E&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nIt moves me.  Peck seems to be speaking for himself as an actor and on behalf of all “Elder artists” … such as myself.\r\n\r\n	When his character says, “I promised I would do something grand, something really grand!” … \r\n\r\n	When he says, “I would write the most beautiful poem … that would make people cry with happiness, love with desperation, make them feel they understood the meaning of their existence on this earth” … \r\n\r\n	When he says, “… and since I was little more than a child and every hour seemed filled with, with limitless possibilities, I told her, ‘Just for a short while” … \r\n\r\n	And finally, when he says,  “For fifty years, I wrote!  I wrote!  I wrote while my youth drifted by…” \r\n\r\nHe could just as well be speaking for himself, saying “For fifty years, I acted!  I acted!”  \r\n\r\nHe could just as well be speaking for me, saying, “For fifty years, I composed!  I composed music!”\r\n\r\nThe scene ends with a kiss, shared as the sun is setting behind the mountains.  Lee Holdridge''s film score, though barely audible, is perfect.  I love Peck’s smile, in the last shot we see of him.  He glows with affection.  \r\n\r\nGregory Peck, I miss you.\r\n\r\nI have arrived at the moment Peck evokes in this scene.  An Elder artist, my life’s work almost behind me, still ready, all the same, to share a kiss and a smile as the sun sets behind the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhat kiss?  I still kiss my dear wife, yes, but the kiss I mean to share, in the larger sense, is the giving away of my life’s work … to you, dear email recipient, and to anyone who expresses an interest in discovering it.\r\n\r\nI put down my composing pen eight years ago, produced my 17th and final CD three years ago, and published what will most likely be my final book a month ago.\r\n\r\nWhat remains is to get my life’s work ‘out there’ where folks can access it, free of charge.  Else, what was the point of fifty years of effort “while my youth drifted by...”?\r\n\r\nThat’s how it is, too, with this new, last book, “Was That Your Piece?”, a collection of my humorous writings.   Ask me and I’ll send you a hard copy, free.  If you want to send a contribution in turn, fine.  My address is below.  All the profits will go to the scholarship fund at the school where I teach.  But no contribution is necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t want another book taking up space in your home, ask me to send you a free PDF of it instead.    \r\n\r\nRegarding W.T.Y.P.?, one of you wrote:  “Thank you for a thoroughly delightful book and for bringing joy to my soul.  My husband said he has never heard me laugh so much while reading a book.”  \r\n\r\nAnother wrote:  “I read it twice and loved it.  I want another copy to give to my best friend.”\r\n\r\nNow, don’t worry about me.  I’m happier than I have been since I was ten years old.  The draining stresses of mid-life are behind me and I’m still plenty creative in my teaching and in the formulation of our plans for the gardens and landscaping that will surround what will most likely be our last home. \r\n\r\nThese Sunday morning emails, which you kindly permit me to send are yet another venue for creativity.  \r\n\r\nThere’s something about Sunday morning that makes it feel like the right time for this manner of sharing.\r\n\r\nThere’s something of Sunday morning, too, in my solo cello piece  titled “Sunday Morning Variations.”  See if you agree.

But, as with all performing arts during this dull time, that activity is on hold.  In the meantime, the symphony expresses it gratitude for the continued support of its audience by offering videos featuring solos by various members of the orchestra. \r\n\r\nFor her part in this series, Sherill chose to play my “Sunday Morning Variations” for solo cello in a video she made in her home.  She introduces herself, the symphony and the piece, speaking to viewers directly, as if we are right in front of her.  \r\n\r\nWhat’s more -- and this is clever -- she introduces each of the variations by sharing the humorous indications I put in the score describing the character of each variation.  \r\n\r\nAudiences are not usually aware of these; they are “an inside joke” between the composer and the performer.  Sherill shares them -- and plays the music -- with the flair of a storyteller.  Watching her face as she plays is a treat.  It’s as if she is entertaining a small child and loving every minute of it.\r\n\r\nI have never experienced music in this way.  Perhaps this is one of the few ‘up-sides’ or ‘silver linings’ that comes with the necessity of living so much of our lives ‘on-line’ nowadays.  In normal times, we would not meet Sherill now watch and listen to her playing and sharing in this way.\r\n\r\nSherill (which is pronounced the same as “Cheryl,”) mispronounces my name.  It should be SO-wahsh.  The first syllable is heavily accented and the second syllable should be pronounced as in the verb “to wash.”  Instead, she rhymes it with “ash.”  An innocent error and one that has often been made by classical music radio broadcasters.  Still, I wanted to set the record straight.\r\n\r\nSome of you may recognize the tune and some of the variations from your having heard or played my “Variations on a Theme by Grandma Moses” for solo clarinet.  The explanation is that I wrote this music first as a set of clarinet variations but then rescored and expanded it into the piece for cello you’ll hear shortly.\r\n\r\nTo see and hear the youtube featuring Sherill Roberts playing my “Sunday Morning Variations,” copy and paste this link into your browser:  \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWIDUxGhIE&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),143);

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(19,replace(replace('Of my own works, my song cycle Bright April is among my half dozen favorites.  \r\n\r\nIt was inspired by John Jacob Niles, a remarkable American composer and collector of folk songs.  He is credited with "Black is the Color of My True Love''s Hair," "I Wonder as I Wander," and "Go ''Way from My Window" ... three of our most beautiful American folk songs.  I saw him at one of his last performances, around 1978.  He was 85 and spell-binding.  He sang in a sweet falsetto, accompanying himself on a giant dulcimer, the size of a cello.\r\n\r\nI was very moved by his performance and I wrote this piece in 1980 as a response and tribute, a cycle of songs for soprano accompanied only by a cello, reminiscent of Nile''s falsetto accompanied only by that giant dulcimer.  It is a setting of six beautiful, pure, simple poems by Sarah Teasdale, about a woman''s responses to love.  \r\n\r\nToo, I wrote the piece as a performance vehicle for married friends -- a soprano and a cellist.  They were a lovely pair in those days and the piece expressed the lovely quality everyone saw in their relationship, though it did not last.  Strangely, the poems touch on the transience of love, too, though I did not think about that at the time.  I’ll include the poems below.\r\n\r\nOne time in Paris, I played this piece for a French soprano, trying to play the cello part on the piano and singing the songs as best I could, roughly translating into French as I went along.  That was a challenge!  When I finished, she asked me to play it again.  Midway through, she suddenly made a strange choking sound.  I thought she was laughing.  I looked around to find that she had burst into tears.  It was a little unsettling for us both, but one of the best compliments ever given to my music.  \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago the cycle was recorded by Susan Olson, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on my vocal music.  The only people who have heard this piece have been those in attendance, here and there, when it has been performed live.  Sharing music with you through these mpFrees has allowed works like this to come to the ears of friends and fans who would never hear it otherwise.  I am deeply grateful to have this technology and to have an audience for it in the form of the recipients of these mpFree messages.\r\n\r\nAt 12 min., 15 seconds, the piece is a little longer than those I usually send but I hope you will take the time to listen to it all the way through.  The loveliest moments are toward the end, as sadness overtakes the love story, though for a composer the most poignant line is certainly the first one:  A little while when I am gone my life will live in music after me....\r\n\r\n4/27/14  To hear mezzo Susan Olson sing Bright April, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 27, 2014\r\n\r\nBelow is the text for Bright April for lyric soprano and cello (1980) \r\nThe poems are by Sarah Teasdale.\r\n	1.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(20,replace(replace('Sage''s Ravine is the third movement of a large work I wrote in 1992 entitled, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail for violin, French horn, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nThe four places are depicted in the order in which a northern bound thru-hiker would encounter them:\r\n\r\nI.  Amicalola Falls - a 400-foot cascade in northern Georgia\r\nII.  Dragon’s Tooth – an outcropping in Virginia, shaped like a giant canine tooth\r\nIII.  Sage’s Ravine – a darkly shaded slice on the border of Connecticut and Massachusetts\r\nIV.  Katahdin – the northern terminus of the trail in Maine\r\n\r\nI have hiked through Sage''s Ravine.  I didn''t encounter any sages there, but I like to fancy that it''s a place where sages might be encountered -- New England sages, modern day Emerson’s and Thoreau’s. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is a sage?  What makes someone a sage? What do sages do?\r\n\r\nIn the words of Odell Shepard, a latter-day New England sage whose writings I admire, a sage "thinks freely --  not as the member of any party, organization, institution, religion, caste, class, nation, or club, not as one having a reputation to gain or support, but simply as one man with his center inside himself, answerable to nothing but the truth ... such thinking as this [is] the hardest work and the finest sport in the world.”\r\n\r\nWhat do they think about, these sages?  They ponder the reconciliation of opposites:  joy and sorrow, good and evil, the sacred and the profane. They strive to perceive the larger whole that contains those opposites.\r\n\r\nFrom birth we are confronted with opposites:  wake and sleep, day and night, hungry and full, mother and father.  Later, we devise mental constructs to help us grapple with more complex opposites:  young and old, past and future, boy and girl, right and wrong.  We cannot unite into a larger whole any of the opposites we encounter in life; we can only try to arrange them into an order that makes some sense.\r\n\r\nFor Western societies, the reconciliation of opposites is a theological problem.  How can an omnipotent, loving God allow the existence of evil?  If God does not create evil, then is it self-creating? implying that God is not omnipotent after all?  \r\n\r\nThe believer must simultaneously accept two contradicting ideas:  the goodness of God and the existence of Evil.  For many people, including a few whom I love, this is impossible.  For them, the existence of Evil obviates the existence of God.  \r\n\r\nThey ask, "If God is God, then how can Evil be?  How can we thank God when good things happen but exculpate God when bad things happen?"\r\n\r\nTheologians posit various responses.  But most believers -- I am one -- only shrug and say, "We just do, that''s all."\r\n\r\nGod is good, yet Evil exists.  These two opposing assertions create a strain in all of us, believers and non-believers alike.  It affects everything, including the way our artists shape their work and the way we respond to their work.\r\n\r\nThe stress of our inability to reconcile these opposites resonates when we encounter a work of art that succeeds in reconciling opposites into a coherent and pleasing pattern, be it a painting, a play or a musical composition.  It seems to me that Western art, when it achieves this, is at its very best.  Indeed, it seems to be the principal difference between the relatively few artistic  expressions that touch my heart and the many other expressions to which I am indifferent.\r\n\r\nTo cite the most famous example:  think of Mona Lisa''s smile emerging from that dreary landscape.  There are myriad others:  remember how skillfully and satisfyingly Cezanne''s greens reconcile his opposing blues and oranges?  and the way his forms are depicted simultaneously from differing points of view?  those apparently twisted tables, tilting teapots, floating apples and oranges?  \r\n\r\nOpposites are everywhere in Western music;  the works of Bach and Beethoven are replete with them:  jerky vs. smooth, energetic vs. plaintive, loud vs. soft, fast vs. slow, major vs. minor, the opposing tonic and dominant keys of a fugue or the sonata-allegro form.  \r\n\r\nThe most salient characteristics of Shakespeare''s characters are their ambiguities -- those wise fools, those flawed heroes, those villains who, maddeningly, mouth such good advice --  they are believable precisely because they are contradictory!  And we love the Bard for having gifted us with them. \r\n\r\nHere at least, we feel, here at last -- if rarely in Life -- we find opposites reconciled and we rejoice in it!.  \r\n\r\n(Contrariwise, the absence of opposites in a work of art renders it boring.  We quickly tire of a flawless hero, a relentlessly villainous villain, a merely foolish fool, a painter who cannot take us beyond a narrow spectrum of form and color, a repetitive pop song with a never-varying beat, a cramped melodic range and the same, tired chords  --  boring!) \r\n\r\nIn Sage''s Ravine, I tried to depict sagacity by attempting to reconcile two opposing musics -- the music of sorrow and the music of joy.  First comes the sorrowful music -- slow, mournful, in a minor key.  Then comes a quietly joyous music, a tune that conjoins elements of Jesu, Joy of Man''s Desiring with the American folksong Shenandoah.  The opposites are established, repeated, and finally reconciled in what I hope is a coherent and pleasing pattern.\r\n\r\nTo hear Sages Ravine, beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2012, public radio station WMRA of Harrisonburg, VA broadcast an interview with me about my Four Places on the Appalachian Trail on a program called "The Spark."  I want to thank producer Martha Woodroof and host Bob Satterwhite for permission to share this interview with my friends and fans.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the interview, go to this page:  \r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/vistas.html\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 4, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nDragon’s Tooth!  That’s the name of a dramatic upthrust of rock, atop a remote mountain ridge in southwestern Virginia.  Its topmost tip offers a 360-degree view, one of very few on the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nYou don’t casually stroll up there for a look-see.  Dragon’s Tooth is very hard to get to, a long, steep, upward clamber, especially difficult when carrying, as I did, a 45-pound backpack full of gear and food for an eight-day, 80-mile hike.  I made that hike with a group of friends when I was in my mid-thirties, trim and fit.  Even so, it just about did me in.  That 80-mile hike was the most physically challenging thing I’ve done.\r\n\r\nDragon’s Tooth is all about energy.  Energy to get up there.  And the immense energy of the Dragon, asleep under the mountain, his one, huge, ruthless tooth protruding.  When he awakes, Lord help us!\r\n\r\nThe music I wrote about the place has a lot of energy, too.  It’s the second movement of my Suite for violin, French horn, cello and piano, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the oldest myths of Western Civilization:  a dragon guarding a great prize, be it a beautiful princess or a treasure of gems, jewelry and gold.  It’s a static situation; the energy is kinetic.  What’s needed is a hero to slay the dragon, fructify the princess and/or redistribute the hoard.  Sure enough, a hero always arrives, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nAs with all great myths, it’s happening right now in the most intimate of human relations as well as the most public.\r\n\r\nMost likely, you know or have known instances of it.  I have.  I was once the close friend of a beautiful, childless princess/treasure/woman whose dragon/husband was selfish, sarcastic and neglectful.  I’m not in the business of rescuing princesses, but it wasn’t long before a suitable hero came along.  He rescued the princess and the two of them have been together now for about fifteen years.  The relationship has been, so I hear, fruitful and rewarding for both of them.\r\n\r\nThe Dragon myth speaks to public life as well.  It offers a dark warning to The One Percent.  Sooner or later, your hoarded treasure will be forcibly released from your grasp.  Your gated communities will not avail you.  The only question is whether your wealth will be redistributed peacefully (by means of taxation) or violently (by means of riots, revolution, the guillotine).  It''s the tax or the ax.  One or the other.  Only a matter of time.  Me, I''d advocate the peaceful means, but it’s not up to me to decide!  Who listens to a composer’s thoughts on such matters?  It’s just as well.  I don''t want the responsibility.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear evocations of the Dragon-Princess/Treasure-Hero myth in this music … the fierce energy of the dragon, the allure of the princess/treasure, the valor of the hero, the inexorability of Fate.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Dragon’s Tooth,”  beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 17, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAt this moment, while I’m sitting here, writing, and you’re sitting there, reading, some two thousand backpackers are in the first days and weeks of what they hope will be a ’thru-hike’ of the fabled Appalachian Trail.  Early spring is when hikers head north from the southern terminus of the trail, in Georgia’s Amicalola Falls State Park.\r\n\r\nTheir friends or families drive them there, spend one last day together, take in the sights of the park; many dine and sleep in the park’s lodge.  Next morning, they see their loved ones off with a good luck wish, a last embrace, a wave of farewell.\r\n\r\nI imagine the feelings of the soon-to-be hiker, family and friends, gathered at the foot of Amicalola Falls, gazing upward at the tallest cascade in southeastern America, more than four times higher than Niagara.  The hiker, perhaps a young son or daughter, a middle-aged adventurer or a newly retired grandpa or grandma, is excited, happy, eager to begin the trek they’ve long planned and dreamed.  The well-wishers are wistful and a little anxious, especially if they are parents.  How well I know that feeling.\r\n\r\nI tried to express this range of feelings in “Amicalola Falls," the opening movement of my suite for French horn, violin, cello and piano entitled, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nI’ve been to Amicalola Falls, scrambled up the ever-wet, slippery stairs, surrendered my eyes to the fascination of the plunging cascades.  “There’s three things you never get tired of watching,” a wise friend once said.  “A flickering flame, water in motion and a baby’s face."\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, I''ve heard the A.T.’s ‘clarion call of adventure.’  Shortly, you’ll hear it, too; there are lots of "horn calls" in the opening movement.  I never heard it more clearly than at Amicalola Falls where so many would-be thru-hikers set out with high hopes of reaching Katahdin, the trail’s northern terminus, 2100 miles distant, way up in Maine.  \r\n\r\nHiking the entire A.T. was a dream I once cherished; now I know I never will.  "It’s all good,” as young people say.  I''ve hiked various segments of the trail in GA, NC, VA, CT, MA and VT, about 250 miles in all.  I served as a trail-worker for two ten-day stints at Konnarock, the A.T. volunteer basecamp in Virginia.  I produced a CD, “Music for the Appalachian Trail,” donating a portion of the profits to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the group that oversees and protects the trail.  And I wrote this suite.\r\n\r\nWriting the suite took about as long as a thru-hike — four months — and I fancied, as I was writing it, that I was making the journey, vicariously.  The four places are depicted in the order thru-hikers encounter them:  Amicalola Falls in GA, where the trail begins,  the rock outcropping named ''Dragon’s Tooth'' in VA, Sage’s Ravine on the border of CT and MA and finally, the goal from the start, Katahdin.\r\n\r\nGrand vistas are suggested often in this music, the big views the hiker comes upon, a relief from the long tunnels of green.  I also included many quieter, more intimate, delicate passages, to express those moments when a hiker stops to gaze in wonder at the saffron-colored lichen on the rocks, a glistening spider''s web or fern fronds dripping dew in the buttery morning light.  \r\n\r\nThe musical motive representing Katahdin is heard in the opening bar of the first movement; only it''s sort of upside down and backwards.  To my way of thinking, it makes sense that the southern end of the trail and the beginning of the suite would consist of the same notes that will be heard in a reverse or retro form at the end of the piece, when the music depicts the northern end of the trail.\r\n\r\nFurther, to emphacize the opposite ends of the trail and the piece, the waterfall is evoked in descending, cascading figures, while the Katahdin motive, when it finally emerges at the beginning of the last movement, is a jagged, rising figure .  But the two musical gestures are, in fact, the same — the trail is perceived from opposite termini and from two places in between.  \r\n\r\nListen for the ''moonlight'' section in the first movement, in a rapid 5/4 time, beginning at 2:28.  It has a  floating, almost meter-less character, a contrast to the rugged, rocky, four-square music on either side of it.  \r\n\r\nTo hear “Amicalola Falls” from Four Places on the Appalachian Trail played by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 26, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Dragon Myth is] Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea serpent.  It’s Bilbo burglarizing the dragon’s trove.  It’s Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty” when the queen turns into a dragon.  It’s Han Solo freeing Princess Leia from the clutches of Darth Vader.  The tale has been told since time immemorial.  \r\n\r\nAs with all great myths, it’s unfolding right now in the most public of our doings as well as the most private...\r\n\r\nThe wealthy, dimly conscious of the situation, always extract a promise from the powerful:  the wealth will be guarded -- ‘protected’ from ‘taxes on the rich’ and inheritance taxes.  \r\n\r\n	“Now as then [in 1936] the profound inequities of American life are the result of laws written at the behest of the wealthy.”  \r\n		-- from yesterday’s column by the NYTimes editorial board. \r\n\r\n‘Twas ever thus.  Cleverly dodging taxation, the rich unknowingly hasten the day when their wealth will be taken from them by means a good deal more unpleasant than paying taxes.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander the Great marched east, his armies came upon temples filled with gold.  For twenty centuries, the treasure had slept there, sterile, unspent, guarded by priests and soldiers.  Alex killed ‘em all and his men got the money.  They spent it on wine and women.  The women and the winesellers spent it, in turn, to feed and clothe their families, fix the roof and install cable tv.  \r\n\r\nOh, but that was then and this is now.  Can’t happen here?  It happens daily as taxes are paid and thieves (white collar and otherwise) break in, figuratively or literally, one way or another.\r\n\r\nThe tale spells it out:  if you have money, spend it, give it away, get rid of it.  If you don’t, it will be taken from you.  It’s only a matter of how and when.  \r\n\r\nMoral:  Don’t be a dragon...\r\n\r\nTo hear “Dragon’s Tooth,”  beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“Moby Dick” has to be a long, thick, heavy book.  It’s about a whale.\r\n\r\nToday’s email has to be oversized, too.  It’s about mountains.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in the Midwest, I had no conception of mountains.  \r\n\r\nI was seventeen years old when I first set eyes on the Rockies.  I arrived in Ft. Collins, Colorado, to attend a conclave of Explorer Scouts from all over the country.  I was met at the airport by the organizers of the event who shuttled me to the campus of Colorado State University.  As we rolled along, I looked out the window of the van and there they were, the Rockies.  \r\n\r\nI stared and stared.\r\n\r\nWhen we met up with a student guide, assigned to showing us around the campus, I remarked, “I’d like to hike over to those mountains some afternoon.”  He gave me a look.  “How far away do you think those mountains are?”  I could tell by the tone of his voice that they were further away than I had imagined, so I doubled the distance I had been about to posit.  “Oh, about a dozen miles, give or take.”  He laughed.  “Those mountains are seventy-five miles away!”  \r\n\r\nI could hardly believe it.  They were as far away from Ft. Collins as Cleveland was from Mansfield, Ohio, where I had grown up.  It was as if I could stand on the courthouse square in downtown Mansfield and view Cleveland’s Terminal Tower, seventy five miles away.\r\n\r\nI was, and have remained, amazed by and drawn to mountains.\r\n\r\nSheltering in place for who-knows-how-long, I won’t be in the proximity of mountains anytime soon though I often think about them.  There’s a little something I do several times a day that keeps me in touch.  I recommend it to you:  look at the webcam images for Glacier National Park.\r\n\r\nYou will see ‘still’ shots, updated every quarter hour.  You can watch the hourly changes of the light and the weather throughout a day, a month or a season.  I watch the snow deepen as Winter comes in and I watch it retreat with the greening of Spring. \r\n\r\nTo view what’s happening right now in front of the Glacier webcams, go to:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm\r\n\r\n‘Bookmark it,’ as we internet adepts say, so that you can return easily and often.\r\n\r\nBe sure to ‘scroll down’ (another pixel of techno-jargon) to see the views atop Apgar Mountain and Logan Pass, the topmost stretch of the celebrated Going-to-the-Sun Highway.  The pass has only just opened, after the road was finally cleared of snow.  Spring comes very late to Glacier. \r\n\r\nAnd here’s another way to visit a vista vicariously … \r\n\r\nListen to “Katahdin,” the final movement from my 1992 suite for French horn, violin, cello and piano entitled, “Four Places on the Appalachian Trail.”\r\n\r\nI tried to find musical gestures that would evoke my feelings about Katahdin, “The Greatest Mountain.” \r\n\r\nMind you, I’ve never climbed it and, having had both knees replaced and finding myself short of breath after climbing a mere flight of steps, I know I never will.  \r\n\r\nTen years ago, Jo and I climbed Old Rag in our beloved Shenandoah National Park.  It just about did us in.  And Old Rag ain’t nothin’, a geological pimple compared to Katahdin.  Our stamina has not improved since.  Some things slip beyond one’s reach.  Many.  Most.  It’s “all good,” as young people say.  Be at peace and enjoy thinking about them.  For me, Katahdin emblematizes -- beautifully and nobly! -- The Unattainable.\r\n\r\nGrand vistas are suggested in this music, the magnificent overlooks a hiker comes upon.  But I also included quieter, more intimate passages, to express those moments when a hiker is stopped in his tracks by saffron-colored lichen on the rocks, a salamander crossing the trail, a dew-bedizened spider''s web or a host of ferns, fragile yet strong, their fronded wealth a-gleam in the buttery, slanting morning light.  \r\n\r\nI’ve seen these things, up close, hiking on the A.T. and in national parks, but I have viewed Katahdin only from afar.  Accordingly, I tried to present Katahdin as a distant ideal and, simultaneously, as “the rough and rugged rock” round which the proverbial "ragged rascals ran.”\r\n\r\nThe music is meant to sound steep, rocky and harsh at times.  Parts of it have a weight and solidity that reminds me of bus-sized boulders.  Not boulders tumbling in an avalanche; I mean boulders just sitting there, “active” in their unique, inert way of boulders.\r\n\r\n	“From stones and poets you may know,\r\n	 Nothing more active is than that which least seems so.”\r\n\r\nI think you’ll find moments of beauty and reverence in this music.  The music reconciles those opposites -- harshness and beauty -- the way mountains do.\r\n\r\nTo hear an impassioned and rambunctious performance of “Katahdin” by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose I asked you:  “What music expresses joy?”  \r\n\r\nAfter a quick dip into your memory, you’d likely answer:  Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” and / or Bach’s “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring.”\r\n\r\nThose two tunes express very particular kinds of joy.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s tune, which is -- have you noticed? -- similar to “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” feels so simple and inevitable that almost anyone can sing it or recognize it.  Rightly so, because the joy it expresses arises from a realization of shared humanity, that we are all brothers and sisters, even those long dead or as yet unborn.  It’s the joy we feel when we know ourselves to be a part of all that is good about human beings.\r\n\r\nBach’s tune very specifically rejoices in the joy of knowing the incarnate God:  sweet, gentle, loving and forgiving Jesus.  This is plainly heard in the tune itself, even as the lyrics provide the verbal assurance.\r\n\r\nMemory shapes composing, too.  When I posed myself the challenge of creating a joyful tune, I pondered those two masterworks.  Supreme as they are, neither addressed the particular kind of joy I had in mind.  I wanted to express a joy separate from egalitarianism or theology, the joy of feeling close to Nature when she is at her most beautiful.\r\n\r\nHow does a composer come to find himself in need of such a tune?\r\n\r\nI needed a tune for Joy and a tune for Sorrow and I needed to reconcile the two, the way a sage does, -- sagaciously! -- as a way of summoning “Sage’s Ravine,” a section of the Appalachian Trail on the border of Connecticut and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSage''s Ravine is the third movement of a large work I wrote in 1992 titled Four Places on the Appalachian Trail for violin, French horn, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nAlthough I didn''t encounter any sages when I hiked through Sage''s Ravine in 1982, I like to fancy that it''s a place where sages might be encountered -- New England sages, modern day Emersons and Thoreaus. \r\n\r\nWhat is a sage? \r\n\r\nIn the words of Odell Shepard, a latter-day New England sage I admire, a sage is someone who …\r\n\r\n	 "thinks freely -- not as the member of any party, organization, institution, religion, caste, class, nation, or club, not as one having a reputation to gain or support, but simply as one man with his center inside himself, answerable to nothing but the truth.”\r\n\r\nSages reconcile opposites:  joy and sorrow, good and evil, the sacred and the profane.  They perceive the larger whole behind and beyond all opposites.  They employ their perception to arrange opposites in a way that makes sense, that feels right, satisfying our need for order.\r\n\r\nFor Western societies, the reconciliation of opposites is the essential theological problem.  How can an omnipotent, loving God allow the existence of evil?  If God does not create evil, then is it self-creating? Then is God not omnipotent after all?  \r\n\r\nThe believer must simultaneously accept two contradicting ideas:  the goodness of God and the existence of Evil.  For many people, including a two or three I love, this is impossible.  For them, Evil obviates the existence of God.  \r\n\r\nThey ask, "If God is good, then how can Evil be?  How can we thank God when good things happen yet exculpate God when bad things happen?"\r\n\r\nTheologians posit various responses.  I have not studied the subject.  It’s above my pay grade.  Like most believers -- I am one -- I shrug and say, "We just do, that''s all."\r\n\r\nGod is good, yet Evil exists.  These two opposing assertions create a strain in all who inherit Western civilization, believers and non-believers alike.  It affects everything, perhaps especially the ways our artists shape their work and the way we respond to their works.  I am not a theologian but I am an artist.\r\n\r\nThe stress of our inability to reconcile these opposites informs our encounters with works of art that succeed in reconciling opposites.  We are pleased by the coherence and pleasing patterns of such an art object, be it a painting, a play, a poem, a novel or a musical composition.  \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Western art, when it achieves such a reconciliation, is at its very best.  Indeed, it seems to be the principal difference between the expressions that touch my heart and expressions which leave me feeling indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe most famous example is Mona Lisa''s smile emerging from that dreary landscape.  There are myriad others:  remember how satisfyingly Cezanne''s greens reconcile his opposing blues and oranges?  and the way his forms are depicted simultaneously from differing points of view?  His apparently twisting tables and tilting teapots do the work of reconciling, before our very eyes.  \r\n\r\nOpposites are everywhere in Western music;  the works of Bach and Beethoven are replete with musical opposites: high-low, loud-soft, fast-slow, jerky-smooth, major-minor, the opposing tonic and dominant keys of a fugue or the first and second themes of the sonata-allegro form.  \r\n\r\nThe most salient characteristics of Shakespeare''s characters are their ambiguities -- those wise fools, those flawed heroes, those villains who, maddeningly, mouth such good advice --  we love the Bard for having gifted us with them, each a reconciliation of opposites.  Think of Hamlet, Feste or Iago.\r\n\r\nHere, in the presence of the greatest art we find, at least and at last -- if rarely in Life -- opposites reconciled.  In that reconciliation we find delight.  \r\n\r\n(Contrariwise, we are quickly bored by the absence of opposites in a failed work of art.  How quickly we tire of a flawless hero, a relentlessly evil villain, a merely foolish fool, a painter who cannot take us beyond a narrow spectrum of form and color, a repetitive pop song with a never-varying beat, a cramped melodic range and hackneyed chords  --  boring!) \r\n\r\nThus, in writing Sage''s Ravine, I tried to depict sagacity by attempting to reconcile two opposing musical metaphors -- the music of sorrow and the music of joy.  \r\n\r\nThe movement begins with the music of Sorrow -- slow, mournful, in the key of D minor.  \r\n\r\nThen comes -- at 1:35 in the recording, measure 38 in the score -- the quiet of joy we find in Nature.  It is scored in D major, the key of Beethoven’s Ode, and cast in 9/8, the meter of Bach’s Jesu. \r\n\r\nWanting to evoke the joy of our encounters with Nature at her most beautiful, I conceived a tune that has the same first nine pitches as the American folksong Shenandoah (excluding the pick-up pitch).  I changed only the durations of the notes.  That folksong has powerful associations for me, remembering hikes and happy times in the Shenandoah National Park, and our daughter, whose name is Shenandoah.  \r\n\r\nI wish I could sit down at a piano with you beside me to demonstrate this transformation.  I doubt my verbal description above will be clear to all of you.  You may listen for “Shenandoah” and not recognize it because the durations are so different.  That’s OK.  Very few listeners, hearing my tune, would perceive its origin in the folksong.  The allusion is there but it will be perceived semi-consciously, tapping into dim memories of “Shenandoah” as well as the Bach and the Beethoven tunes  “My” tune is an amalgamation of all three. \r\n\r\nThe opposites -- sorrow and joy -- are established, repeated, developed in the movement and finally reconciled in what I hope is a coherent and pleasing pattern.

It''s one of the most delightful pieces to have come through me. \r\n\r\nBellville is the village in north central Ohio where I met my future wife, fell in love with her, courted, married and lived for twelve years.  Our two children were born there.  I loved Bellville during those years.\r\n\r\nI was 27 years old in 1977 and it was one of the best years of my life.  I had no regular job and was painting houses, off and on, for most of that happy year;  I had plenty of spare time.  I wrote some of the best music of my career.  I earnestly tried to create a musical style that would express my immediate environs:  Bellvillle, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nThe challenge of figuring out how to express my immediate location inspired me.  I thought that music composed in an Ohio village ought to sound subtly different than music written in, say, Nebraska or Vermont.  I undertook to become a Regionalist composer.  No one had ever attempted such a thing in Bellville, Ohio!  I was a pioneer!\r\n	\r\nRegionalism has been a major force in American literature and painting, and also in American music.  Charles Ives’ programmatic pieces express his New England, just as Gershwin’s jagged, sky-line melodies and Bernstein’s big-city rhythms express New York City; Oklahoman Roy Harris’ Third Symphony captures the massive spaciousness of the Great Plains; Ferde Grofe’s dear, old, Western-sounding Grand Canyon Suite conjurs that landscape perfectly;  Aaron Copland caught the Midwest in The Tender Land, the West in Rodeo and Billy the Kid, New England in his Suite from Our Town and the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachian Spring (oh, I know he didn''t name that piece until after it was completed but listeners everywhere envision the Appalachians when they hear that music).\r\n\r\nEach of these composers evoked particular American landscapes.  Their best-loved regionalist works have found a place in the hearts of music-loving audiences all over the world.  \r\n\r\nI studied these works and took a lesson from them.  My piano trio, Four Seasons in Bellville, was the best result.  The tunes are lyrical and abundant, the harmonies lush and rich, like the fabled soil of Richland County, Ohio, where Bellville is located.  Richland County’s topsoil is sometimes eight feet deep!  The best vegetable garden we ever had was in our backyard in Bellville.\r\n	\r\nThis trio is a four-movement work, of course, one for each season.  Music about Spring must suggest color, movement, growth and romantic love.  Think of wild flowers, refreshing rains, filmy, yellow-y, breeze-tossed branches and burgeoning streams.  \r\n\r\nTo hear "Spring" from Four Seasons in Bellville, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 11, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nSummer in rural Ohio is a robust time for the plants; gardens grow like crazy, the leaves on the trees are a bright Kelly green.  It’s an energetic season for humans, too:  picnicking, hiking, boating and fishing, baseball, summer camps, Fourth of July fireworks, county fairs, long, bright days.\r\n\r\nI ought to know because I lived in rural, north central Ohio for forty-four years before moving to Cincinnati in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn my twenties and early thirties I aimed to express my immediate environs in my music, to wit, Bellville, Ohio, the village where we lived.  How I loved Bellville in those days!  It was where I met my future wife, where she had grown up, where we fell in love, courted, married and lived for twelve years.  It was the village to which we brought home from the Mansfield hospital our two newborns. \r\n\r\nMusic written in and about an Ohio village ought to sound different, I thought, from music written in and about villages in, say, Oregon, Nebraska or Vermont.  I sought to imbue my music with the lush verdure of rural Ohio and the sense of abundance that arises from the fertility of topsoil that''s eight feet deep!  I wanted my music to convey vigorous good health and the feelings that arose from the rolling land around us, a quilt of thick forests and fields of corn, the green leaves and yellow tassels glistening in the sun between frequent and delicious rains.\r\n\r\nI thought I’d live a long life there, then die and be buried in the Bellville cemetery.  But in time we came to feel that we’d exhausted the resources of the place.  Twenty-one years ago we moved to Cincinnati so that our children could attend the School for the Creative and Performing Arts.  We’ll never exhaust the resources of the Queen City, a richly blessed and generously endowed cultural center which has been very good to me, to us.\r\n\r\nMy Piano Trio #1 is touchstone, a reminder of who we were and where we were in the summer of 1977.\r\n\r\nTo hear the exuberant Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) superbly playing the “Summer” movement from my Piano Trio #1 “Four Seasons in Bellville,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 26, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Mansfield, Ohio; I attended Jr. and Sr. High School in nearby Lexington, Ohio.\r\n\r\nBellville, ten miles south of Mansfield, six miles east of Lexington, is the village where, 50 years ago next month, I met Jo Anna Ackerman, my future wife.  We fell in love, courted, and married in a 7:30 a.m. ceremony on the front porch of her family''s Bellville home, the only home Jo had ever known.  \r\n\r\nOur falling for one another was in the stars; our respective maternal grandfathers had been the closest of friends, decades before we were even born.  \r\n\r\nJo and I lived in Bellville for twelve years.  It''s where our two children were born and passed their toddler years.  \r\n\r\nOne of the best of those years was 1977.  I was 27, blissfully between jobs and writing some of the best music I ever wrote.  My ''higher education'' was three years behind me and I was at last discovering my own voice as a composer and discovering what it was that I had to say.\r\n\r\nI felt inspired to try to create a musical style that would express my immediate environs, a great point of departure for any young artist.  I felt that music written in and about an Ohio village ought to sound subtly different from music that might be written in and about a village in Vermont, Nebraska or Hawaii, to say nothing of villages in India, Paraguay or Lithuania.  \r\n\r\nBut how, exactly?  How should Bellville, Ohio be expressed, musically?  What intervals, chords and rhythms should be used?  What contour should the melodies have?  \r\n\r\nI would be the first composer to address such questions about Bellville, Ohio.  I would be a pioneer.  \r\n\r\nMusic lovers are curious to hear works that express a particular part of the world.  Thus, the success of nationalist composers like Grieg, Dvorak, Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and our own Copland and Gershwin.  Those composers had a lot to say about the parts of the world from which they hailed and we relish their works to this day.\r\n\r\nToo, musicians in other parts of the world expect an American composer to sound American.   When I wrote French-sounding music for my French musician friends, they objected:  "We already have French-sounding music,” they said.  "Give us music that sounds American."\r\n\r\nI absorbed that lesson early on and Four Seasons in Bellville was one of the best results.  \r\n\r\nBellville is in Richland County, Ohio where the soil is famously fertile; our vegetable garden was a wonder.  I felt that the music of Bellville must express this.  Such music must be, I thought, lyrical and lush, rich and abundant, tonal and, above all, generously tuneful.  \r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the least edgy or sketchy about Bellville.  No hipster has ever dwelt there, nor ever will.  No avant garde music could express that village.  Music  about Bellville must be conservative, i.e., tonal and melodic. \r\n\r\nWhat music for autumn in Bellville?  It must evoke the colors of October.  The melodies must descend, gently, like falling leaves.  It must be radiant though imbued with a feeling of fond farewell.  If I have my way, the Autumn movement from my Four Seasons in Bellville will be played at my funeral.\r\n\r\nAutumn in an American village is a commonplace, a cliché for gift calendars and magazine covers, an enticement for the ‘leaf peepers.''  Trite?  Perhaps.  But if we cannot relish the near-at-hand, the obvious, the commonplace, then what is left will be, by definition, only the far-off, the remote, the inaccessible, the blandly international.  About that time, I read Thornton Wilder’s last novel, "Theophilus North," in which is to be found this caution: "If we shrink from platitudes, platitudes will shrink from us."  \r\n\r\nThornton Wilder also said, “Literature is the orchestration of platitudes.”  Let’s orchestrate the obvious, as beautifully as we can.  Let''s bloom where we''re planted.  Let''s rejoice in who we are, where we come from and what is right in front of us.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the incomparable Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) play, with deep feeling, the "Autumn" movement from Four Seasons in Bellville, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nI am eager for you to see our newly finished backyard garden.  I can’t invite you to come in person, so I made a slide show of its development, put my music to it and made it available for you to view with a click on the link below.\r\n\r\nBut first, this:\r\n\r\n	Year that trembled and reel''d beneath me!\r\n	Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,\r\n	A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken''d me,\r\n	Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,\r\n	Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?\r\n	And sullen hymns of defeat?\r\n\r\nThus wrote, of all people, America’s great optimist, our dear, sweet, gay, old Walt Whitman,.  You don’t expect Uncle Walt ever to be downcast.  In this poem, he is.  \r\n\r\nAll of us are struggling through just such a year.  \r\n\r\nHow shall we respond, hour by hour, day by day?  Shall we chant the ‘sullen hymns of defeat’?\r\n\r\nNot me.  Not yet, anyhow.  We must resist the grief, shock, stress and depression as best we can.  As you find ways to do this, share them with others.   What are your tricks?  How do you dodge despair?  I’d like to know.\r\n\r\nHere are some of my practices:  \r\n	Each morning I read the NYTimes. \r\n	I phone elected officials three or four times a week.  \r\n	I paint toy soldiers (I’m working on a really cool set of Robin Hood figures right now).  \r\n	Almost every day, Jo and I ride the bike trail to Terrace Park, sit on a bench on the village green, eat a peach, and then bike home.  We’ll miss that very much when the cold weather comes.  \r\n	We undertake challenging jigsaw puzzles.\r\n	I plan the meals, order groceries, cook and clean up while Jo does political phone bank work.\r\n	We watch too much news but also good TV when we can find something that interests or amuses both of us.  (That is difficult, as our tastes are quite different.)\r\n\r\nAnother positive thing I do is write these emails to y’all -- about 650 ‘friends and fans’ who have asked to be recipients.  \r\n\r\nI sometimes feel a little embarrassed when I send y’all a cheery email, like last week’s trumpet duet.  I’d feel the same way if I were distributing M & M’s to fellow passengers on a sinking ship.  But a friend corrected me:  “You’re not passing out M & M’s,” she wrote.  “You’re passing out life jackets.”  That was a pleasing reassurance.  In any case, I persist.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is our garden, a small but splendid thing that took shape as these past six months “trembl’d and reel’d beneath” us.\r\n\r\nThroughout this difficult span of time -- March through September, 2020 -- we often reminded ourselves, “At least our garden is coming along.”  It was a comfort and the finished garden is a delight.  I’m sitting in the Greek revival pavilion right now, touching up this week’s message.  The fountain is burbling, the crickets are screaking.\r\n\r\nTo see a 5-minute slide show of how the garden took shape between last March and last week, accompanied by the Mirecourt Trio’s recording of the “Summer” movement from my Piano Trio #1 “Four Seasons in Bellville,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),71);

Those are journey forms:  you''re here, you depart, you come back.  That simple.  \r\n\r\nSimpler yet:  theme & variations.  A tune gets repeated, each time differently.  Instead of journeying, you stay in the same place and watch things change.  Simple.\r\n\r\nThe forms are easy to explain.  Employing the forms effectively is tricky.  \r\n\r\nIt''s like chess.  Explaining how chess is played takes only a few minutes.  But playing the game well?  Hoo boy.\r\n\r\nTunes come easily to me.  Figuring out what to do with them, how to make them function in a larger form, that''s where the work is.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI''ve tinkered with musical forms for fifty years.  I''ve particularly relished my attempts at theme and variations.\r\n\r\nThere are a handful of helpful tricks to be learned from the Great Ones who mastered this form. Use a simple tune.  Vary the meter.  Ornament the tune with grace notes.  Put at least one variation in a minor key.  Alternate the character of the variations  between poignant and humorous, dramatic and understated.  Structure the whole piece so that the variations seem to be going somewhere, heading for a destination.  We can tolerate repetition in music, as in life, only so long as we sense that there is a larger purpose being served, a direction unfolding.\r\n\r\nMost of my music is programmatic;  which is to say that it is ostensibly "about" something non-musical. \r\n\r\nBut the piece I want to share today is not about anything;  it is only about itself.  I think that when you listen to it you will sense that it is moving from a charming innocence at the beginning to a radiant resignation at the end.  \r\n\r\nRobert Frost said, "A poem should begin in delight and end in wisdom."

Presenting such gifts, we don''t expect cash or a barter item in return.  The mention of cash or a hinted expectation of receiving a bartered item in return would be insulting.  A gift is a gift.\r\n\r\nYet gifts do return to us.  A certain old book promises as much:  "Cast your bread upon the waters and after many days it shall return to you."  What goes around, comes around.\r\n\r\nI''m writing these words in early June while staying in our friends'' home on a quiet backroad in the mountains of northwest Connecticut.  When they travel, we house-sit for them.  We''ve done this for years.  We keep an eye on things, pull a few weeds, do a little house-painting, nothing much.  House-sitting here is their gift to us, our gift to them.\r\n\r\nI could recount many other instances of our participation in The Gift Economy, both as givers and receivers.  With us, it''s a way of life.\r\n\r\nWhen our kids were little, a friend was part owner of an historic hotel in Cape May, NJ, which allowed him three weeks of free lodging each year.  Like most rich people, he was too busy and never took advantage of the opporunity.  He kindly offered the free lodging to our family.  We joyfully accepted!   Each summer for seven years we passed three idyllic weeks in beautiful, quaint, historic, Victorian Cape May.\r\n\r\nWe had some of the best times of our lives there, strolling streets lined with lovingly restored homes, enjoying the gardens, picnicking at the Cape May Point Lighthouse, looking for Cape May ''diamonds,'' semi-precious gems that wash up on the beach.  I bought a bag of plastic toy pirate coins and tossed them, one by one, in the sand just ahead of our little son, when he wasn''t looking; he had the fun of finding them.\r\n\r\nEach morning, I''d get up very early (I''ve always been an early riser), slip out to a bakery, buy almond croissants for the family, return to our room to leave them on the dresser, then stroll the beach at my leisure, noticing things, humming to myself and thinking about music as the dawn gave way to day.\r\n\r\nThat was the origin of "Morning at Seaside," the opening movement of my four-movement Cape May Suite.  The cello opens with five notes depicting a wave hovering and then crashing, followed by a longer, rising phrase suggesting a larger heave of water behind it, also making a rising, hovering, then crashing motion.  The other instruments soon enter, developing that opening ''hovering-then-crashing'' motive.\r\n\r\nIt''s scored for only four instruments -- oboe, violin, cello and piano -- but the combination sounds surprisingly orchestral.  \r\n\r\nI wrote my Cape May Suite -- for free -- for the West End Chamber Ensemble, musicians who played those instruments.   In turn, they premiered and recorded it -- for free.   Now I''m sharing it with you -- for free.  \r\n\r\nThat is how the Gift Economy works!

He’s going to yammer on about movements when the Nation is wrenched with grisly news of murder and mayhem and the vitally important issues of racism and the containment of violence demand our attention?”  Yes, I am.  Why?  Because one appropriate and healthy way of responding to horror, racism and violence is to affirm the value of the good things we all cherish — among which are music, friendship and community. ]\r\n\r\nA movement is a section of a larger work.  A short silence separates it from preceding and following movements.  A movement is a completed expression and can stand alone. But the logic of its existence is stronger when it is heard in its place, among the other movements in the larger work of which it is a part.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of movements in a multi-movement work is not random.  The sequence is devised to provide contrasts in tempo and character as the listener journeys through the entire work.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the first movement of a concerto is usually moderately fast and expansive in character;  the second movement is usually slow, sensitive, introspective;  the third movement is usually fast and rousing, a shameless bid for a big round of applause after the last note is sounded.  (Most concertos have three movements, most symphonies four.)\r\n\r\nThe differing character of the movements is not random either.  The movements must be diverse, but not too diverse.  Unless the composer is going for humor or irony, a funeral march ought not to be followed by a polka.  Different as the movements may be from one another, they still need to be in some way unified, a sum greater than its parts.  \r\nComposers are fascinated by things like this.  But I have noticed that the eyes of non-composers glaze over pretty quickly when the conversation turns to musical structure.\r\n\r\nPeople need a metaphor to which they can relate.  Understandable!\r\n\r\nHere’s one:  think of a multi-movement piece of music as a series of related paintings by the same artist, displayed together.  The wall space between the paintings corresponds to the brief silences between the movements.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve hung paintings, you know that there is an art to it.  It’s a tricky business, balancing several paintings so as to please the eye.  There is a mysterious tension between the paintings, arising from their size and content.  \r\n\r\nIt’s the same with movements.  Composing is not only a matter of coming up with good tunes.  Songwriters do that and hats off to them.  But composers are concerned with the ways in which music compels and rewards careful listening over an extended period of time.  That is achieved partly through the distribution of contrasting movements.\r\n\r\nThere are four movements in my Cape May Suite for oboe, violin, cello and piano.  The first and last, entitled “Morning at Seaside” and “Ghostly Waltzes at Congress Hall,” are long, about eight minutes, and scored for all four instruments.  The music in those movements has an expansive, public character.  \r\n\r\nBy contrast the two inner movements, entitled “Dinner at Louisa’s” and “Couple in a Victorian Garden,” are short, two or three minutes long.  Both are scored for just two instruments and have a quiet, private character.  “Dinner at Louisa’s,” depicting a couple dining in a small, intimate restaurant, is scored for cello and piano.  “Couple in a Victorian Garden” is scored for the other two instruments:  oboe and violin.\r\n\r\nReturning to the analogy of paintings on a wall, the outer movements are like two large paintings while the inner movements are like two small paintings.  Think how you might arrange two large paintings and two small paintings, hanging all four on the same wall.  \r\n\r\nThat was part of what I was thinking about when I assembled my Cape May Suite.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, our daughter, Shenandoah, who was 11 years old when I wrote this music, was captivated by the “Couple in a Victorian Garden” movement.  She listened to the recording of it many times and often told me, “Papa, that is the most beautiful music you ever wrote.”   Mind you, at that time she had heard relatively few of my 400 works but she was, typically for her, completely confident in making this pronouncement.  That’s our girl!\r\n\r\nSee what you think.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Couple in a Victorian Garden" from my Cape May Suite played by oboist Robert Franz and violinist Brendan Christensen, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 10, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	One time when I was a boy, I opened my bedroom door and there was Johnson.  He passed through me with a low moan, and went out the window.\r\n\r\n	It set me back a bit.  I was just a boy and had never seen a ghost before.\r\n\r\n	Next morning, I mentioned it to my Dad.\r\n\r\n	“Oh yes,” he answered.  “That’s Johnson.”  And he told me his story -- and how we’d gotten the house for twenty thousand less because of him.\r\n\r\n	Johnson, it seems, when he was alive, had loved a girl by the name of Emily who used to live in our house.  He was too poor to marry her so he kissed her goodbye and set off for the California Gold Rush.\r\n\r\n	Twenty years later he returned, only to find the house silent and deserted.  Emily and her folks had disappeared one foggy night and no one had seen or heard of them since, although the landlord and most of the local merchants had made serious inquiries.\r\n\r\n	Poor Johnson sought his lost love all over the world for years after, but never found her.  He finally returned to this very house, where he had visited the girl so long before.  He wandered about the rooms, weeping and calling her name, and when the fellow died, why, naturally enough, his ghost retained the habit.\r\n\r\n	After that it seemed we were always meeting Johnson.  At first, we walked around him or stood aside to let him pass, but after a while there didn’t seem much point to such courtesies, since he could walk right through us.  \r\n\r\n	You couldn’t say he was ever in the way.\r\n\r\n	He was a gentle, harmless old ghost and we all felt sorry for him.\r\n\r\n	But, after a while, he got to be a pain.  He was so darned gloomy all the time.  And all that moaning and sighing -- you could hardly sleep.\r\n\r\n	“I’ve had about enough of this,” my Dad said one evening.\r\n\r\n	“Well,” said my mother, “you won’t see the last of him until he’s found Emily’s grave.  That’s what he’s after.”\r\n\r\n	Now this seemed reasonable, but none of us knew the location of the grave.  We thought of palming off some other Emily on him, but though we searched up and down every aisle of the local cemetery, there were no Emilies to be found.  I never saw a cemetery so destitute of dead Emilies.\r\n\r\n	“How ‘bout if we fake him out?” my brother finally suggested.  He put up a little mound out back of the house with a slab of wood sticking out of it, on which he scribbled, “Here Lies Emily.  Her last words were:  Tell Johnson I love him.”\r\n\r\n	“That oughta fetch him,” my brother said.\r\n\r\n	Sure enough, Johnson showed up that very night.  The way he flung himself on that mound and wept was one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever seen.  We all had tears in our eyes, I can tell you.\r\n\r\n	He never troubled us in the house again after that.  He spent every night sobbing over the grave and seemed quite happy and content.\r\n\r\n	Is he still there?  Sure he is.  I could take you round to see him.\r\n\r\n	10 p.m to midnight are his usual hours.  10 to 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.\r\n\r\n					- - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nThe above is my re-telling of a story by Jerome K.

Just so you know, our family is well, so far, though very concerned and extremely cautious.  We don’t enter Kroger’s; our groceries are brought out to our car.  Church and school are shut down indefinitely; both have a lingering presence on-line and I keep in touch.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we’re riding the bike trail, doing jigsaw puzzles, watching shows on Netflix & Acorn.  \r\n\r\nI’m catching up on my daydreaming, rediscovering the deliciousness of an afternoon nap, and indulging in long swings in the hammock I stretched between two mighty pines in the far rear corner of our property.\r\n\r\nMy psyche is buoyed by something beautiful that is growing and developing in defiance of the numbing news of disease, death and economic collapse that press upon us.  I want to tell you about it.\r\n\r\nIt''s a major landscaping project we began last Fall and which we hope to see it through by this summer’s end.  \r\n\r\nWe commissioned the design and construction of a 12’ by 12’ pavilion in the center of our back yard.  It looks like a simplified Greek temple.  In keeping with the Greek Revival style of our house, the ‘temple’ replicates the white pillars and cornices that grace our front porch.  \r\n\r\nLike many ancient Greek structures, it is simply a square topped by a triangle.  The tin roof will form a shallow pyramid and will be painted the same forest green color as the shutters and window boxes on our house, the house''s roof, the picket fence, the park benches, the cellar door, the shutters and window boxes, etc.  The pavilion is pure white.  Inside, we’ll look up at a tongue-and-groove cedar ceiling.  It’s an American expression, in wood, of what the ancients did in stone.  I am eager to sit out there when I can listen to raindrops tapping on the tin roof.\r\n\r\nThe back yard will be reconfigured into a lower and upper garden, separated by a low stone wall with a small fountain in the center.  We’re planting many shrubs, perennials, Emerald arbor vitae and Green Giant pines at the front and sides of our property.\r\n\r\nThe final touch will be double French doors opening out to the pavilion from the rear of the house, where there is now only a blank wall.  \r\n\r\nAt present the backyard looks much more like a construction site than a garden.  Still, It is satisfying to see it coming into being, to see a dream realized.\r\n\r\nUnlike my books and music, our garden is being created for a minuscule audience:  just Jo and me and the rare guest or family member who might eventually join us in our ‘Greek temple.’   But that’s OK.  Some art is intended for a tiny audience.  \r\n\r\nThis is almost certainly the last dwelling place that we two will fashion for ourselves and we want it to be a nourishing environment, inside and out..  \r\n\r\nJo and I haven’t much minded hunkering down these past ten weeks because that is pretty much our style in any case.  We never went out much.  We love our home and we like being together so, though I’m almost ashamed to admit it, considering how many are suffering so egregiously, the two of us are not only well but pretty happy most of the time.\r\n\r\nI grieve the loss of the world as it was — no more church, in effect, no more school — and I grieve and pray for all who are suffering — but I try not to wallow.\r\n\r\nI don’t know — who does? — what the future holds for my many friends who are actors, musicians, choir directors.  We are all groping to find ways to share our art in this time.  In one sense, that’s nothing new.  I groped for years before I discovered the potential that lies in sharing these emails about my writings and music.\r\n\r\nThese emails you kindly permit me to send are a modest attempt to offer a bit of … what?  … not escape, exactly …. a regularly recurring reminder that there are other realms of interest besides the dreary dirge of bad news.\r\n\r\nThough it wasn’t what I intended when I began sending these emails six years ago, that act has evolved into a sort of service I can offer, a ministry of sorts.  At least that is what it feels like to me now.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Couple in a Victorian Garden" from my Cape May Suite played by oboist Robert Franz and violinist Brendan Christensen, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),60);

"I''ll help you."  (He called me Stoogahtz; I never knew why.)\r\n\r\nBetween my 7th and 12th grades, those two teachers taught me 90% of what a composer needs to know.  That''s how strong the music program was in the 1960''s in the public school system of Lexington, Ohio (pop. 4,000).\r\n\r\nMr. Evans was a composer, too, though with a very narrowly defined style.  He wrote short, modal choral works that drew on the musical legacy of his Welsh ancestors.  He instructed me at length, often after school on his own time, teaching me music history, music theory, counterpoint, harmony, orchestration.  Mr. Dunlap did, too.  \r\n\r\nA young man needs an older man, who is outside his family, to affirm him, to let him know that he has value, that he has gifts to bring to the world.  Those two teachers, along with my Scoutmaster Frank Culp and a few others, did that for me.  In turn, I’ve tried to do the same for many younger men in the course of my life.  Indeed, I continue to do this at the school where I teach.    \r\nI learned so much from those two music teachers that in my senior year I was able to write a melodramatic tone poem and to conduct our high school orchestra in the first (and only, thank goodness!) performance.  Looking back, I realize that it wasn’t a very good piece of music but the act of writing it and conducting it was a very big step for me.\r\n\r\nThere was one issue on which Mr. Evans and I could never agree.  We had long, good-natured arguments about musical style.  Mr. Evans felt that a composer should find his one, true style and stick with it.  I disagreed passionately.  What fun would that be?  \r\n\r\n"What if I feel like writing something in the style of Wagner or Gershwin or Mozart?"\r\n\r\n"Why would you want to do that?"\r\n\r\n"Because it''s fun, that''s why!"\r\n\r\n"But you''re not Wagner or Gershwin or Mozart.  You''re Rick Sowash.  Figure out what Rick Sowash''s music ought to sound like and then write that."\r\n\r\nWorking within a narrow style suited Mr. Evans; for me, that would have been suffocating, a self-imposed prison sentence.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, I’ve never fussed about my “style.”  When ideas sought me out I brought them to reality as best I could, never considering whether or not I was being consistent with my style, whatever that might be.  \r\n\r\nFrankly, I don''t think I have a compositional style.  Yet friends tell me that when they hear my music on the radio, they know it''s mine -- because they recognize my style!  Go figure.\r\n\r\nIt''s a strange thing to step back and consider one''s own life''s work.  For a long time, your life’s work something that is ahead of you.  Then it’s something you’re in the middle of.  At length, it becomes pretty much a done deal, a thing that is mostly behind you.\r\n\r\nWhat''s to be said about my life''s work? this stuff I''ve birthed into being?  It''s often fun; it often makes people smile, humorously or poignantly.  It always sounds American, that''s for sure.  No surprises there.  Making people smile gives me joy and, having lived my whole life in mid-America, my music is bound to sound American.  \r\n\r\nWhat about my ethnic heritage?  If Mr. Evans'' music grew out of his Welsh heritage, then out of what heritages did my music grow?\r\n\r\nMy father''s ancestors were French; I speak and teach French and I adore France; some of my work sounds a little French-y.  My mother''s parents were Austro-Hungarians, from the region that is called Serbia today, though they considered themselves Germans, not Serbs.   Sure enough, an Eastern European sound sometimes pops up in my music as well.  \r\n\r\nListen to this, for instance:  a short, bluesy cello cadenza is followed by a "Galop" that blends my American and Eastern European musical DNAs.  It''s the second movement of my Piano Trio #2 "Orientale and Galop," as recorded by the incomparable Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) for whom it was composed and to whom it is dedicated.  \r\n\r\nI don''t know how to categorize the style of this music but, true to form, it sounds American and it’s a whole lot of fun.

Recommendations from friends.  \r\n\r\nThe NYTimes’ reviewers knows more movies, but my friends know ME. \r\n\r\nI’d to love to have your suggestions.  What are some movies or series which you’ve liked and which you think we might like?\r\n\r\nI’ll return the favor in advance, right now.  Here are some of mine.\r\n\r\nFilms I liked enough to watch several times:\r\n\r\n“Millions” -- Two pre-teen English brothers discover a duffel bag containing a fortune in cash.  One, guided by the saints who appear to him, wants to give the money to the poor, the other wants to invest it in real estate.  It’s touching and very funny.\r\n\r\n“Downfall” -- The last days of Hitler, a compelling and timely drama of Shakespearean intensity and acting so gripping that I found myself inadvertently holding my breath at times.\r\n\r\n“Raiders” -- In this documentary, we meet three adolescent boys who re-shoot, frame by frame, the entire film, “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”  Spielberg did the original on a budget of $20 million, but their only resources are their allowances, their imaginations and the willingness of their friends to be cast as extras.  Twenty years later, they rally to finish the final sequence, win attention from film buffs in a presitigious festival and even get to meet Spielberg himself.  Funny, touching, inspiring.\r\n\r\n“Marvellous”  -- Spelled with two “L’s”, “Marvellous” features the marvelous Toby Jones as Neil Baldwin, an eccentric man sustained by his faith in God and the goodness of others.  Quirkily, the actual Neil Baldwin often appears alongside Jones in the film.  You see both the original Neil and Jones’ portrait of him, side by side, consulting with one another in a good-natured competition for our affection.\r\n\r\n“Shakespeare Retold” offers re-imaginings of four Shakespeare plays.  The best are “Much Ado About Nothing” and “The Taming of the Shrew.”  Both  are adorable; I’ve watched them at least five times.  Shirley Henderson’s shrewish “Kate” defies description. \r\n\r\nMiniseries:\r\n\r\nJeremy Brett’s “Sherlock Holmes” -- About forty programs comprise this incomparable series.  True to Doyle’s original text and spirit, these are the definitive treatment of the great detective’s adventures.  Made nearly forty years ago, they are timeless.  The main title theme, heard at the beginning of each episode, never fails to induce a goosebumps.  Which is weird.  Why does music, aimed at our ears, sometimes shiver our forearms, making “each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine”?\r\n \r\n“A Touch of Cloth” -- A hilarious send-up of British murder mysteries and cinematic clichés.  This series had me laughing out loud more often, than anything else I’ve seen in recent years.\r\n \r\n“The Detectorists” -- Toby Jones again as half of a Laurel & Hardy-like team that uses metal detectors to search for buried treasure.  Hapless, they fail at almost everything, as do L. & H., but their passionate commitment to their calling as “Detectorists” and their L. & H.-like friendship buoys them up and sees them through.  It’s funny but somehow inspiring, too.\r\n \r\n“Call My Agent” -- In French with subtitles, the series follows a band of intriguing misfits who just manage to run a Paris talent agency.\r\n \r\n“Foyle''s War” -- Michael Kitchen’s ‘finest hour’ as an aging detective solving crimes in coastal England during World War II.  It offers glimpses of an England we never hear about:  traitors and collaborators who were sure the Nazis were going to win and engaged in treachery.  \r\n\r\nNow let’s turn to the Mirecourt Trio’s video.  The late Ken Goldsmith (he passed this year, aged 82) introduces the piece, referring to “a young composer from Bellville, Ohio.”  I haven’t heard that phrase for a long time!\r\n\r\nHe explains that they will play the 2nd and 3rd movements of my Trio #2, originally a three-movement work.  I subsequently dropped what had been the first movement, incorporating it into another work.  At Ken’s suggestion, I then subtitled the Trio #2 “Orientale & Galop.”  \r\n\r\nThis is the superb Mirecourt Trio at the top of their game.  No musicians played my music better than they nor did as much for my growth as an artist.  Cellist Terry King in particular taught me so much and greatly improved my capacity to write well for his noble instrument.\r\n\r\nThe opening four notes are identical to those of the theme of Jeremy Brett’s Sherlock Holmes series (the one that gives me goodbumps) and in both pieces, these notes are played by a solo violin.  It’s pure coincidence.  When I wrote this music, the Sherlock series had not yet been broadcast in this country; I could not have heard the theme.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the Holmes series, I exclaimed, whimsically, “They stole my tune!”  Such coincidences happen sometimes.  There are only so many musical shapes that can be constructed from of a handful of notes.  As doctors say, “It’s perfectly normal and nothing to worry about.”\r\n\r\nTo see and hear violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen -- what a blessing they were in my life! -- playing my Piano Trio #2 “Orientale & Galop,” click on the link above.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/P_O-GZQwJYM\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the Orientale, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the Galop, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),72);

It''s said that when friends entered Brahms'' apartment after he died, they found Scott Joplin''s "Maple Leaf Rag" on the Master''s piano.  Brahms must have been intrigued by this new American music!\r\n\r\nEleven and a half decades later, the popularity of Ragtime has not faded.  It''s a musical perennial.\r\n\r\nMy woodwind quintet, Three American Perennials (1974), contributes to three musical genres of which Americans have never tired:  folk dances, sea chanteys and ragtime.  \r\n\r\nRags are usually scored for solo piano but part of the fun of this piece is hearing a rag played, improbably, by the five ill-matched instruments, each very different from the rest, that comprise the woodwind quintet.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of original tunes comes, at the very end, "Jolly Redwing," played by the French horn in counterpoint to everything else that''s going on.  It''s a tribute to my Grandpa Sowash who loved to play that tune on the banjo and said it was his favorite.\r\n\r\nTake three and a half minutes and give a listen to HarmoniaV, a Connecticut-based wind quintet, giving a spirited and extraordinarily precise rendition -- these guys are really good! -- of the Ragtime movement by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 6, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIn the 1958 film “The Last Hurrah,” Spencer Tracy, as Mayor Frank Skeffington, poses a question to Jeffrey Hunter, who plays the Mayor''s nephew.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me this.  What would you consider to be the greatest spectator sport in the country today?  Would you say it’s basketball?  baseball?  football?  It’s politics. That’s right, politics.  Millions and millions of people, following it every day … They know the names and the numbers of all the players.”\r\n\r\nHe’s right!  What a spectacle!  Never boring.  And so much more at stake than with mere ball games.  Of what consequence is a sports victory, after all?  How will our lives be any different, win or lose, after “the big game?”  Contrariwise, the consequences of American elections are global.\r\n\r\nThe perennial presidential election process is a dizzying whirl of sweeping promises, comic blunders, shrewd calculations, stupid ideas that “seemed good at the time,” the bartering of cash for influence.  Every time, we hear the boast: “I don’t need their cash!”  Don’t you believe it!  Then there’s the sign-making, flag-waving, door-to-dooring, ringing endorsements, bombastic trumpeting, the glorification of buffoonery.  \r\n\r\nEvery election cycle we are assured that, this time, it’s “a battle for the very heart and soul of the country.”  Oh yes, it''s a stark choice between the abyss if their candidate wins and paradise-on-earth if our candidate wins.  Afterwards, neither is realized.  They must now be RE-elected because:  “We’ve come a long way, but we have a long way to go!”  \r\n\r\nThink of it!  The thing steams on for almost two years before the actual vote, picking up momentum, accelerando e crescendo poco a poco.  \r\n\r\nSporting matches, by contrast, last a couple of hours, tops.\r\n\r\nThe zaniness of American political life springs from — what else? — the frenetic energy of our intense, outspoken, multiloquent populace.   \r\n\r\nWe the People bubble and rumble with joy and disgust, hope and despair, laughter and bitterness.  What sports fan emotes as deeply as the impassioned politico?\r\n\r\nAmerican political life would be insufferable if it weren’t so fascinating, so entertaining.\r\n\r\nHow to express, musically, this tumble-jumble, this rannygazoo of immense assurances and petty connivance?   \r\n\r\nWay back in 1974, during the doomed presidency of Richard Nixon, I took a shot at expressing precisely that tumble-jumble in the first of my Three American Perennials for woodwind quintet, a salmagundi of original folk-like tunes set alongside authentic American folk-tunes including “Old Dan Tucker,” “Camptown Races” and, at the very end, ironically, “Simple Gifts.”\r\n\r\nWhy do I say ironically?  That strong and simple Shaker tune gets touted as being somehow emblematic of America.  In a way it is, sure.  We love that tune and what Aaron Copland did with it in his “Appalachian Spring.”  \r\n\r\nBut while this American life — particularly our political life -- gifts us with constant, peppery, dangerous entertainment, it is anything but simple.  \r\n\r\nOnce only in my composing career, in writing this exuberant, chaotic first movement, have I tried to convey an aural image of political complexity energized to the edge of insanity.  Accordingly, the music is acrid, almost sinister, a little harsh but somehow good-hearted.  Then and now, especially during presidential campaigns, that''s how American society seems to me.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the end, at 3:33, you’ll hear the French horn ripping out six glissandos. Think of those as the trumpetings of the Republican elephant.  Are they a shrill heralding of victory?  or shrieks of despair at the realization that, for the coming term, while the losing side is mired in the Slough of Despond, the victors will hold the office that was so hotly contested?  I couldn’t say.  Music itself has no party affiliation.\r\n\r\nRight after the last horn glissando the movement abruptly ends with a snatch of “Simple Gifts.”   \r\n\r\nSimple?  America?  "AS IF!"   \r\n\r\nGive a listen to HarmoniaV, a Connecticut wind quintet, giving a spirited, witty and extraordinarily precise rendition -- these guys are really good! -- of the first movement by clicking on the link above. \r\n\r\nYou can also click on the link above to see a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 28, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHenry Thoreau observed that a blackberry, plucked off the bush and popped into the mouth, is a different thing than that same blackberry, plucked off the bush and plopped in a box to be sold at market.  \r\n\r\nThe glisten and savor of the blackberry remain.  The meaning of the blackberry is what changes.  When any thing or service is proffered for money, its significance dwindles, its salience fades. \r\n\r\nFive years ago, I began giving away my music to anyone who is interested in discovering it.  Musical blackberries!  Ripe for plucking!\r\n\r\nWould you enjoy CDs of my music?  Let me know, provide your mailing address and I’ll send you a box of ‘em, for free.  \r\n\r\nWould you like the sheet music for any of my works?  Let me know which and I’ll send you PDFs of the score and parts.  Print ‘em out, pass ‘em around and play ‘em, for free.\r\n\r\nThus, like Thoreau''s blackberry, plucked and promptly partaken, the salience and savor of the music is retained.\r\n\r\nA new CD of my music, entitled “Seasonal Breezes,” will be out next summer, featuring three works for cello & piano, a clarinet-cello duo, and a suite entitled “Seasonal Breezes” for flute, cello & piano.  It is costing about $7500 to produce.  I will press a free copy into your hands next time I see you, at church, at school or wherever.  \r\n\r\nIf you are not one of my local friends and fans, I’ll email you a ‘birth announcement’ about the new CD, offering to snail-mail it to you, if you want it.  My gift.\r\n\r\nHow about that?\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy?” I hear some of you asking.  “Or rich?  Or both?”\r\n\r\nOf course I’m crazy; I''m a composer!  That goes without saying.  (If I had any sense, I’d be managing a hedge fund.)\r\n\r\nRich?  A rich friend told me, “Rich is relative.”   At the top of the hill on which I live are million dollar properties with expansive views of the city and the Ohio Valley.  At the bottom of the hill are Section Eight housing, grim apartment buildings with no view.  \r\n\r\nAnd the Sowashes?  Our building is located about a quarter of the way up from the bottom..\r\n\r\nDon’t worry.  Early next year, I will invite my friends and fans, far and near, to help me offset some of the expense by tossing some ‘happy cabbage’ my way by sending me a check in the mail or transferring some of your hard-earned coin to me via Paypal.  \r\n\r\nEverybody will be offered a free CD, mind you.  My gift.  For those who toss me some ‘happy cabbage,’ the CD will be an exchange of gifts.  For those who demur, the flow of gifts will be One Way.  \r\n\r\nEither way, it’ll be great. \r\n\r\nToo, as I have done with the other 16 CDs I’ve produced, I’ll send it, free, to about 160 American classical music radio stations who, hopefully, will broadcast it, gifting the ears of thousands of listeners.  All for free.  An expression of my gratitude.\r\n\r\nGiving away one’s life work is stress-free and joyful.  Accepting what gifts may flow back is equally so.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of stress and joy … three days a week I drive to a school called “Leaves of Learning” where I joyfully teach courses in French, Music Theory and Storytelling.  The school is ten miles from downtown Cincinnati, where I live.  \r\n\r\nUsing the interstate highway, I can drive to school in about 18 high-stress minutes.    Few observe the speed limit.  Tailgating is constant and relentless.  Sociopaths go blinding past my little car at 90 m.p.h.  Eighteen-wheelers burgeon, boom and galumph.  I hated driving the interstate to school and back.\r\n\r\nThen I found an alternate route that is almost stress-free:  i take the lovely, winding, little-used Victory Parkway from Eden Park to the other side of Xavier University, cut over to Norwood on quiet Sherman Avenue, then head north on Montgomery.  It requires about ten more minutes than the interstate route.  The drive is pleasant, scenic, relaxing and far safer.\r\n\r\nToo, my snug little Honda Fit burns less gas at 35 mph than it does at 65 mph.\r\n\r\nDodging stress is all well and good.  Even better is to make headway in the opposite direction of stress, toward serenity, toward joy.\r\n\r\nHow?  One way is to listen to music.  Another is to contemplate something bigger and older than our brief lives, our little selves.  If possible, do both at once.\r\n\r\nFor example, listen to Debussy’s “La Mer” and contemplate the ocean, a thing very much bigger and older than ourselves.  (“La Mer” is French for “The Sea.”)\r\n\r\nMy piece, “Sea Chanty,” the second of my “Three American Perennials” for woodwind quintet, opens with a quotation from Debussy''s “La Mer.”  The Master’s little nautical tune peeps around the corner of my own tunes in this “Sea Chanty," right to the end.\r\n\r\nTo hear this particular ''musical blackberry'' performed by Harmonia V, a superb, Connecticut-based wind quintet, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of you have kindly written to say that the stories I’ve recently shared about my adventures in France make it sound like a paradise.  It’s not.\r\n\r\nIt’s “modern times” there, too, and human nature is the same, everywhere and always.  Pickpockets are notorious in Paris.  Be warned; they sometimes work in groups.  One common trick is to ask you to sign a petition; while one distracts you face to face with a clipboard, another closes in from behind.  Before I venture onto the streets of Paris, I run a slender rope through my wallet.  I tie the rope snugly around my waste, carrying the wallet inside my pants, right below my belt buckle.\r\n\r\nIt’s not only criminals who are greedy.  As in the Yoo Ess of Ay, the petty avarice of merchants is all too real and, properly viewed, almost comical.  \r\n\r\nThe first time I was in Paris, my friend and host, a native-born Parisian, suggested we pop in at a Lebanese bakery which, he said, proffered fantastic pastries.  While we were still on the sidewalk, he warned me about the proprietor.  “Be prudent,” he said, “The baker is Lebanese.”\r\n\r\nI thought, what’s this?  Eccentric Parisian stereotyping of nationalities?  Like assuming all Americans wear cowboy hats?  I asked if he was joking.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t.  “I explain you,” he said in his funny English, which gives me a notion of how I must sound when I speak French.  “The Lebanese are the most great traders of the world; they descend of the ancient Phoenicians.  They try always to profit you.”  \r\n\r\nHow could anyone be ripped off in a bakery?\r\n\r\nInside, a pastry caught my eye.  The sign beside it said, “5 F.”  (This was in 1991, before the Euro.)  When my turn came, I ordered that pastry.  The big, fat boss, head shaved, aproned, took it out of the display case, gave it a light dusting of powdered sugar, pushed it toward me across the counter and growled, en français, “7 F.” \r\n\r\nI pointed out that the sign said 5 F.  Ah, but that was without the powdered sugar, he replied.  I said I had not asked for the powdered sugar, only the pastry.  But the powdered sugar was on the pastry now, he said.  \r\n\r\nMy friend, in line behind me, chuckled softly.  A silence fell over the other customers.  The baker did not back down.  He argued with me and I with him.  I told him he could sell the pastry with the extra powdered sugar to someone else, gesturing to the listening crowd behind me.  What I ordered, I said, was a plain pastry, without the extra powdered sugar -- and for 5 F., as advertised.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally saw that I would not back down, he scowled, sighed melodramatically and took my 5 F. piece.  “Next!” he said.  \r\n\r\nOne moment in the life of a Lebanese baker in Paris.\r\n\r\nWhen we were back on the sidewalk, my friend said, “Well done.  I have pride of you.”  \r\n\r\nThe pastries were fantastic.  My friend knows his city.\r\n\r\nPetty greed is not unknown on this side of the pond.  Have you opened a tin of sardines lately?  Inside, you’ll find four sardines with ample space left over for a fifth.  Remember how tightly they used to be packed?  “Squashed in like sardines” is an expression we use.  Someone figured out that, by packing them loosely, four sardines can be sold for the price of five.  The customer won’t know until they get home and open the can!\r\n\r\nLast week, I needed to buy an eyedropper.  I only needed one.  Ah, but “they come” in packages of two.  You have to buy two.  So now I possess two eyedroppers.  Same with toothbrushes.  You can’t buy just one.  Someone figured out that, given no choice, you will buy two rather than leave empty-handed.\r\n\r\nThose sly Phoenicians ain’t got nothin’ on us.\r\n\r\nOn another subject ...\r\n\r\nThe New Britain Symphony (of New Britain, Connecticut) is presenting  "Welcome to the Orchestra", four videos designed for middle school students.  The video about the orchestra’s woodwind section features a performance of my “Ragtime” for woodwind quintet, preceded by a ‘zoom’ interview in which I respond to some intriguing questions posed by the host, Netta Hadari.\r\n\r\nI think you would enjoy it.

It was the first of my orchestral works to be recorded and the only one performed by a major European orchestra. \r\n\r\nHere''s how it happened ....\r\n\r\nIn 1991, I made my first trip to Paris, where I befriended French clarinetist Lucien Aubert.  He asked me to write several pieces for him -- a quintet for clarinet and strings, two reed trios and a piece called Voyage of the Spirit which turned out to be the first of no less than thirteen clarinet, cello and piano trios I was to write for Lucien over the next decade and a half.\r\n\r\nI had already written for clarinet and liked the instrument very much but when Lucien requested these pieces, I concentrated on the instrument.  To date, I''ve written 51 works featuring the clarinet.  For me, it has come to be an autobiographical instrument.  For better or worse, I see my character and personality reflected in the clarinet;  it can be foolish or wise, sarcastic or noble, trite or impassioned, funny or dead earnest.  Same goes for your friend, the undersigned.\r\n\r\nFinding ways to couple the clarinet and the cello, with the piano as a backdrop, proved so compelling that I almost could not stop writing works for that combination of instruments.  There was so much to explore, so many possibilities.  That''s why I''ve written more for that combination of instruments than for any other.\r\n\r\nStylistically, the thirteen trios zig-zag wildly as they progress;  each is in some way the opposite of its predecessor.  Taken altogether, they form a trajectory, aiming all along at my epic-length clarinet concerto, though I did not realize it at the time I was writing these trios.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, when I was about half-way through the writing of my thirteen trios, my Italian-American clarinetist friend Angelo Santoro asked me to write a one-movement work for clarinet and orchestra which he could premiere with the Cincinnati Community Orchestra.  I complied with The View from Carew, a Romance for clarinet and orchestra.\r\n\r\nAngelo premiered it, playing beautifully as he always does, a noble presence with his silver mustache and black tuxedo.  Afterwards he informed me that the Romance was destined to be the slow, middle movement of a full-length three-movement concerto and that now I must write the other two movements!  He kept after me, phoning me every couple months to ask how the concerto was coming along.  Finally, in the summer of 2007 I accepted the challenge of writing the substantial outer movements that an expansive middle movement would require.\r\n\r\nI wanted the concerto to be like a large mural in a public place.  I wanted it to express suitably large ideas.  I wanted to affirm my conviction that tonality, tunefulness and traditional musical architecture are as powerfully expressive as ever in our 21st century.  I wanted the concerto to convey optimism, friendship, love of Nature; I wanted it to brim with joy.  I wanted it to sound American, to evoke our country''s spaciousness and potential, mixing elements of folk music and jazz and extending the film score devices of the great Hollywood westerns. \r\n\r\nI wanted the solo clarinet''s relationship with the orchestra to be that of a friend and a teacher -- not an adversary.  I wanted the clarinet to present gifts to the orchestra -- exuberant, celebratory tunes that the orchestra could joyfully “learn” and play in turn.  Most of all, I wanted you, the listeners, to experience the piece as a gift, a most welcome gift.\r\n\r\nI became so excited writing this piece that there were times when sleep evaded me.  I could not turn off the music that came pouring into my head.  Some days I worked for nine hours straight, resenting the pauses I had to make in order to eat or visit the bathroom!\r\n\r\nBy winter, the concerto was complete and, thanks to a grant Angelo got from the Cincinnati Foundation, he premiered it the following April with the Clermont Philharmonic, the community orchestra he founded many years ago.\r\n\r\nI wanted clarinetists to know about this piece.  Googling assiduously, I found the names and email addresses of a couple hundred clarinet professors.  I sent each a cheery email, introducing myself and the concerto, attaching an mp3 of Angelo''s performance and a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nA half dozen responded.  A month later, one of those, David Drosinos of Baltimore, MD, was asked by the conductor of the St. Petersburg Symphony if he would like to record a CD with that orchestra and if he knew of any new American clarinet concerto that had not yet been recorded.  "Do I ever!" he replied and they recorded mine.  \r\n\r\nDo you imagine that these things just happen?  No.  Recording is how post-Soviet orchestras survive without the government support they once enjoyed.  David, bless his heart, funded the entire project out of his retirement savings.   The expense was enormous.  You would be shocked to know the amount.  When I thanked him, he said, "Well, what else could I do to advance my career? rent Carnegie Hall and do a recital?  What would that mean to anybody, really?  This way, I got to do the premiere recording with a major orchestra of a concerto I really like.  And, from now on, whenever your concerto is broadcast on American classical radio stations, my name will be mentioned as the soloist."  \r\n\r\nTrue enough.  Thank you, David, with all my heart.  And Angelo, my good friend.\r\n\r\nSome time I''ll send you the other two movements.  \r\n\r\nFor now, please listen to David Drosinos and the St. Petersburg Symphony play the third movement from my Clarinet Concerto.

Well, you chucklehead, there’s the conductor, in person, the Maestro himself, sitting right over there, not fifteen feet behind you.”\r\n\r\nI twisted my chucklehead around to look across the crowded restaurant and, sure enough, there he was, breakfasting and holding forth before a half dozen adoring associates.  I couldn’t make out what he was saying but he was clearly telling a story.  He was making wide gestures, pointing both forefingers toward the ceiling as he spoke, waving them around as if directing a hovering host of angels, invisible to the rest of us.\r\n\r\n“All you have to do,” urged my friend, "is stand up, go over to his table and introduce yourself!  Tell him you want the orchestra to play your concerto!  Tell him your buddy bet you a hundred bucks that you wouldn''t have the nerve to do it.  What have you got to lose?”\r\n\r\nI poked moodily at my scrambled egg burrito.  “That’s not how it’s done,” I murmured.\r\n\r\n“Well then, make an appointment and go see him in his office.”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t see me.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Anyway, I’d be embarrassed.  Successful composers don''t do such things.  Philip Glass? John Adams?  They don’t contact conductors.  Conductors contact them.”\r\n\r\nA great burst of laughter erupted over at the conductor’s table.  He had arrived at the punchline.\r\n\r\n“So what’s Plan B?  Wait a minute!  I have it!  Next time the symphony is going to perform, you get to Music Hall early and chain yourself to the railing, right out in front, where everybody can see you.  Tell ‘em you refuse to take nourishment until the orchestra promises to do your concerto.  In short order, the police will hacksaw through your chains and plop you into the hoosegow.  You''ll have to pay a small fine, sure.  But take the big, broad, flexible outlook.  Think of the free publicity!  What a news story that would make!  ‘Local composer arrested for trying to persuade the Cincinnati Symphony to perform his clarinet concerto.  Details at Eleven.''  How about it?” \r\n\r\n“I know you mean well, but --”\r\n\r\n“Okay.  How about this?  We’ll order a bunch of of bright yellow t-shirts and have ‘em printed up to say, ‘Play Sowash’s Clarinet Concerto.”  Then we’ll get all your friends and fans to wear them while forming a human chain around Music Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Yellow?”\r\n\r\n“Green, then.  Purple.  Fuschia.  Whatever.  Doesn’t matter.  The important thing is:  no one gets in or out of that human chain until the Symphony agrees to —“\r\n\r\n“Oh, brother.”\r\n\r\n“How about a petition drive!  You’d be the first composer ever to do such a thing.  Start right now, here in this restaurant.  Take your napkin around to every table and ask them to sign —“\r\n\r\n“Now, look here.  I’m not going to —”\r\n\r\n“Or just do whatever it is you need to do to win a MacArthur Genius Award or the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Or, better yet, the Legion of Honor.  You’ve got friends in France.  Ask them to pull a few strings!  The Symphony will be knocking at your door!”\r\n\r\n“Right.  Like any of that’s gonna happen.”\r\n\r\n“You''re such a mugwump!  Here’s the best idea yet!  You HIRE the Symphony to play your concerto.  They’re in business like anyone else.  How much do you suppose they would charge?”\r\n\r\n“$100,000 — at least.”\r\n\r\n“No problem.  How old are you?  65?  Okay, then.  You’ve got ten years before Rick Sowash''s Big 75th Birthday Celebration Concert.  Put aside a mere $10,000 a year and, bingo, you’ll have exactly enough Happy Cabbage to hire the Symphony.”\r\n\r\n“10,000 a year?  Gulp.”\r\n\r\n“Make it your 80th birthday then.  Put aside $6,666 a year.  You shake your head?  Then make it your 90th birthday celebration.  You’ll only have to squirrel away four thousand clams a year.  Again, this head shaking?  I can’t believe my eyes.  Alright-y then.  Make it your hundredth birthday!  You’ve got thirty-five years to raise the moolah.  Where''s my calculator?  That’s $2850 per year.   $237 per month.  Less than a car payment.  Eight smackers a day.   Are you going to sit there and tell me that you can’t cough up eight smackers a day to get the Symphony to play your clarinet concerto?  Are you serious or are you not?  Rick Sowash!  Hear me!

The re-greening grass, the swelling buds, the wild chives, the blossomings of forsythia first, then daffodils, then red bud and finally “Loveliest of trees, the cherry now.”  Bring on the tulips!\r\n\r\nThe great resurrection, the northern hemisphere’s great delivery on the promise of joy and hope and gratitude, just for being alive.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful, how beautiful,” writes Elizabeth von Arnim in her novel, Enchanted April.  "Not to have died before this.  To have been allowed to see, breathe, feel this."\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman’s “The First Dandelion” gets it said, once and for all:\r\n\r\n	Simple and fresh and fair, from winter''s close emerging, \r\n	As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics had ever been,\r\n	Forth from its sunny nook of shelter''d grass, \r\n	Innocent, golden, calm as the dawn, \r\n	The spring''s first dandelion shows its trustful face.\r\n\r\nA fine thought, however commonplace and obvious, can never be said too often.  \r\n\r\nVon Arnim and Whitman notwithstanding, I attempted to say it, too, in the first movement of my Concerto for Clarinet & Orchestra, cast in the bright and brassy, golden-white key of B flat.\r\n\r\nRemember all those concertos in which the soloist bends the orchestra to his will?  Beethoven’s concertos cast the soloist as a dominating Napoleonic hero, imposing his will upon the other musicians who share the stage.  Such concertos exalt the soloist as a Romantic hero, a poet-prophet-artist, the superior being prevailing over and against the larger society.\r\n\r\nAll due respect to those great concertos, there would be none of that in my clarinet concerto, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nThe clarinetist, in my concerto, is a teacher-friend.  The clarinetist offers musical ideas, ’teaching’ them to the orchestra, who then joyfully embraces the clarinet''s ideas, developing them in cooperation with the soloist.  The mood is celebrative, joyful, Spring-like.\r\n\r\nThe concerto affirms friendship.  I wrote it specifically for my good friend Angelo Santoro who premiered it after having prodded me to write it for seven years.  \r\n\r\nIt also affirms tonality and tradition.  It sounds, I think, very American, in the manner of Barber, Copland, Randall Thompson and other American composers whose works I admire, with just a touch of the influence of Hollywood best ‘western’ film scores.\r\n\r\nCuriously, though the concerto was composed seven years before I became a teacher, it also affirms teaching.  \r\n\r\n(In my new book, "What Book Next?”  I tell the story, quaint and queer, of how I was led, in my mid-sixties, to take up teaching.  It’s yet another instance of the quiet work in my life of what I choose to term the Hand of God.  I wrote the book specifically to raise funds for ‘my'' school, as well as to delight those among my fans and friends who read it.  See the P.S. below.)\r\n\r\nIsn’t that strange?  I never imagined that I would be a teacher.  Yet here is this concerto, springing from my own pen, foretelling my destiny, auguring what was to come. \r\n\r\nI grasped this for the first time only last week when we listened to my concerto in the Music Theory & History course I teach at Leaves of Learning.  As I heard myself explaining to the students that the concerto''s soloist was cast in the role of a teacher-friend, I suddenly realized that the work predicts my own development as a teacher-friend.\r\n\r\nOne’s art grows out of one’s life;  one’s life grows out of one’s art.\r\n\r\nI have never perceived this so clearly.\r\n\r\nLife.  A series of marvels and miracles.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to another of Whitman’s audacious, vernal quips:\r\n\r\n“Why, who makes much of a miracle?  As to me I know of nothing else but miracles.”\r\n\r\nWhitman, my hero.  Uncle Walt.  I must read “The Song of Myself” again, soon, for the hundredth time.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of miracles, to hear clarinetist David Drosinos (without whose unexpected, unrequested and very substantial financial support this concerto would never have been recorded — Thank you, David!) and the St. Petersburg Symphony under Vladimir Lande play the opening movement from my Clarinet Concerto click on the link above.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet-piano reduction of the score is easier to follow than the full orchestral score.

I’d suggest $25, but $10 is fine.  $7 would cover the production costs and shipping.\r\n\r\n	To receive your gift copy, please reply with “send it” in the subject field along with your address in the body of the message  \r\n\r\n	Use Paypal’s ‘send money’ function or write a check payable to Rick Sowash and mail it to me at: \r\n		6836 School Street \r\n		Cincinnati, OH  45244.\r\n\r\n	The school deserves support.  I have seen the positive effects the school has on students, currently about 285, pre-K through 12th grade.  \r\n\r\n	The school is independent.  This allows teachers great freedom but it also means that the school depends upon tuition and fund-raising.  No church, municipality or millionaire stands ready to cover a shortfall.  \r\n\r\n	Tuition fees are modest and scholarships are given to students who are needy.\r\n\r\n	It is an immense joy to give away my life’s work.  I send my PDFs of my sheet music and CDs free of charge to anyone who is interested via email.  I’d love to give away my books for free but a book is a thing of substance, unlike a PDF, and postage adds up.  So this is the most generous way I can conceive to share my new book.\r\n\r\n	Now let’s listen to the composition of which I am most proud:  my Concerto for Clarinet & Orchestra.  \r\n\r\nTo hear clarinetist David Drosinos (without whose unexpected, unrequested and very substantial financial support this concerto would never have been recorded — Thank you, David!) and the St. Petersburg Symphony under Vladimir Lande play the opening movement from my Clarinet Concerto click on the link above.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet-piano reduction of the score is easier to follow than the full orchestral score.

Writing vocal music is easy for me, almost effortless.  Fun, too.  The hard part is finding a suitable text. \r\n\r\nWhat makes a text suitable?  Simplicity, sincerity and good vowels. \r\n\r\nSimple?  When sung, English is sometimes difficult to understand.  The words must be simple.  As Winston Churchill said, "Short words are best and the old ones are best of all."  \r\n\r\nSincere?  Another Englishman, Ralph Vaughan Williams, said, "There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers."\r\n\r\nGood vowels?  Ahhh, oooh, uhhh and ohhh.  Diphthongs are nasty to sing.  So is the short "i" as in "which."  Speaking of "which," it''s best to avoid texts with nasty consonant clusters like "wh" and "ch" and "st" and "sp."\r\n\r\nThe text must have something to say.  It doesn''t have to be great, just something.  The lyrics to Schubert''s most famous song, "The Trout," summarized:  "A happy trout swims in a clear brook until he gets caught by a fisherman."  That''s a great song text?  Ah, but what Schubert does with it!  The sunny day, the bubbling stream, the joy of swimming and of youth, your whole life ahead of you, all of that is in the music; the text is merely the vehicle.\r\n\r\nI said that writing songs was almost effortless.  Let me explain.  I didn''t have to invent a tune for Kathryn Jackson''s little poem "Prairie Prayer."  It sang to me as soon as I set eyes upon it.  \r\n\r\nThe words literally instructed me as to how I should construct the melody.  Prairies are level; the opening four words had to repeat the same note so as to be musically level.   Since mountains are higher than prairies and the sky is higher than mountains, the words in the second line obviously demanded an ascending melody.  That''s just common sense.\r\n\r\nThe words "here in the middle am I" must be placed in the singer''s mid-range, half way between the notes assigned to the prairie and those assigned to the sky.  That’s a ‘no-brainer.’\r\n\r\n"Hills crowd down to the river," must be sung to a descending melody, with flowing eighth notes to suggest the river.  Duh.\r\n\r\nThe climax comes when "the sky bursts out with a million stars," so, of course, the word "sky" must be assigned the highest note of the song.  Finally, "nigh unto God am I" must have a reverential feeling, like a benediction.  \r\n\r\nSee how easy it is?  This song wrote itself.  All I had to do was stay out of the way and notate it.\r\n\r\nI think Richard Rodgers felt the same way about Oscar Hammerstein’s lyrics.  He found that the melody was already implicit in the words.  Just stand back and let ‘em sing.\r\n\r\nIf I had an endless supply of texts like “Prairie Prayer,” I could write a song every day.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Dan Hoy sing this little song, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the sheet music, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 20, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),114);

I had a big bouquet of flowers delivered and prepared one of her favorite dishes:  salmon cakes with lemon-capers-yogurt sauce.  I’ll include the recipe at the bottom of this message.

For my part, I wanted to write some music that would allow me, in my own small way, in my little corner of the world, to welcome back the spirit of Beethoven.

The famous tune is only briefly recognizable; it quickly goes in new directions.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear it you might smile, despite the gloomy news stories.\r\n\r\nThe modified Cat tune is followed by my Americanized version of a rollicking Belo-russian folksong.

I didn’t resist.  Who wants yet another grim and grumpy piece of music?   Since my music was turning out to be sunny, hopeful, even humorous, I titled the suite, “Sunny Days.”  \r\n\r\nThe piece begins with an Introduction:  stern, impressive, mighty and momentous, as if three powerful world leaders are taking their positions behind three podiums on a stage before the United Nations.   Picture them, ‘dressed for success,’ their postures stiff, their faces deeply serious.  They seem poised to announce something sombre, sweeping and grandiose. \r\n\r\nThen comes a surprise.  The introduction gives way to an ‘oom-pah, oom-pah’ in the piano … and the three leaders smile, embrace and, laughing, they begin to dance!\r\n\r\nah, HA!\r\n\r\nTo hear the opening movement of Sunny Days played exuberantly by violinist Paul Patterson, clarinetist Anthony Costa and pianist Phil Amalong, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 24, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October of 1942, a time as dark as our own, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning play, “The Skin of Our Teeth,” the great American playwright Thornton Wilder scripted these words for his protagonist, George Antrobus:  \r\n\r\n	“Every good and excellent thing in the world stands moment by moment on the razor-edge of danger and must be fought for, whether it is a field or a home or a country.”  \r\n\r\nThat assertion can be understood in at least two ways.  \r\n\r\nEither it’s depressing, because it says right out loud that we will never achieve a lasting victory in these battles we’re fighting over disease control, health care, feeding the poor, income inequality, climate change, the environment, peace and justice for all … \r\n\r\nOr it’s exhilarating, because it says right out loud that we will never surrender, that we will do what needs to be done and that humanity will prevail, albeit ‘by the skin of our teeth.’\r\n\r\nIt was a desperately needed affirmation in 1942, as it is today, as it always will be, let’s face it, at every moment of our long journey.\r\n\r\nBear that in mind as you, please, let me share a little piece of music that attempts to make that same affirmation:  we will prevail.\r\n\r\nThe violin-clarinet-piano trio named "Sonsa" (the Russian word for "sun") chose that name because all three musicians have family in Belo-russia and because the trio was planning a performing tour of that country.  \r\n\r\nIn 1994, the trio asked me to compose a work they could premiere on the tour.  Thinking that Belo-russian audiences might like to hear what an American composer could do with their country''s music, I asked Corinne to send me a selection of some of the better-known folksongs.\r\n\r\nI gave those folksongs an "American" treatment, intending to offer a metaphor of hope, cooperation and mutual appreciation between former Soviet Union countries and America in the post-Cold War era. \r\n\r\nThe character of the piece is sunny, joyful, optimistic, even humorous. \r\n\r\nIf you listen carefully, you will recognize the delightful folk-like tune Prokofiev assigned to the cat in Peter and the Wolf. \r\n\r\nI gave it an American inflection by changing the meter, adding a pinch of Copland and a dash of the Blues.  The famous tune is only briefly recognizable; it quickly blasts off in new directions.  \r\n\r\nThe modified ‘cat tune’ is followed by my Americanized version of a rollicking Belo-russian folksong.

He sent me recordings, took me to concerts, played his guitar for me. \r\n\r\nSince the late ''70''s, Randy has been one of my best friends and the person with whom I have worked most closely on my many projects.  He''s a graphic artist by trade and you''ve seen his work:  Randy designed my website and the covers of all my CDs and most of my books.  He is extraordinarily good at what he does, visually conveying the character of the music and stories I want to share.\r\n\r\nWhat''s more, he commissioned me to compose two works to mark two major events in his life.  I wrote my Mt. Airy Wedding Suite for oboe, violin and cello to be played at his wedding to Michele, which took place in Cincinnati''s lovely Mt. Airy Forest.  And I wrote my Lullabye for Kara for cello and piano to commemorate the birth of his daughter, Kara.\r\n\r\nRandy is a glider enthusiast, owns his own glider, belongs to the Dayton-area glider club founded by Orville Wright.  He''s taken me flying in his glider, twice.  He''s also a sometime painter, a serious cook, vegetarian, wine enthusiast, art collector and, like me, an ardent Liberal.  In his younger years, he bicycled and camped his way through the mountains of New England for weeks on end.  He is fascinated by ancient Mayan civilizations, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and the history of the guitar.  Randy is one of the most interesting people I know.  \r\n\r\nDespite his exuberant enthusiasms, Randy is soft-spoken and, surprisingly, a little melancholy. The music he loves most is sad, intimate, introspective.  We want friends to like the gifts we present them.  In 2011, when I finally wrote a guitar suite as a gift for Randy, I tried to give the music those qualities.  \r\n\r\nI titled the guitar suite For An Old Friend.

Such is the case with two gifts I am sending your way this Christmas morning.\r\n\r\nThe first is a gift I received from one of y''all, i.e., one of you good folks who kindly permit me to catapult these weekly emails into your in-box.  Gary Wakenhut, whom I have never met, is a healer, musician and videographer.  He is also an ardent protector and appreciator of the beautiful Pigeon River that flows through the north central part of the southern peninsula of Michigan, where he lives.  \r\n\r\nUtilizing, as the film score, the second movement of my “Voyage of the Spirit” (Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano), Gary assembled a lovely piece of video art entitled, “Life of the Forest:  The Pigeon River.”  \r\n\r\nGary really listened to the music.  You can tell by the way he ‘cross-fades’ his gorgeous images precisely when one long phrase of music ends and another begins.  \r\n\r\nWith my blessing and thanks, he has mounted it on YouTube for anyone to see and hear.  It’s so beautiful.  Click this link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICbdPOsIN8\r\n\r\nThe second gift is a piece I composed for my guitarist friend Randy Wright after he had good-naturedly pressed me to do so for many years.  \r\n\r\nI’ve been hanging out with Randy since the late ''70’s.  We’ve worked on many projects.  He''s a graphic artist by trade; most of you have seen his work:  Randy designed my website and the covers of most of my CDs and books.  He is extraordinarily good at what he does:  he has a talent for visually conveying the character of my music and stories.\r\n\r\nHe also does behind-the-scenes chores for me such as creating the links in these weekly mpFrees.  Without Randy’s help, I could not share my work with you in this way.\r\n\r\nRandy has many enthusiasms, yet he is soft-spoken and melancholy; he loves best all music that is sad, quiet, intimate and introspective.  (Unlike the undersigned, he isn’t drawn to Sibelius.)\r\n\r\nWe want our friends to like the gifts we present them.  In 2011, when I finally wrote a guitar suite as a gift for Randy, I tried to give the music those wistful, ''anti-Sibeliian'' qualities he cherishes.  And I gave the suite a very ''un-Sibelian'' title:  "For An Old Friend at Christmas.”  \r\n\r\nRandy loved the piece but hesitated to record it for me.  Instead, he facilitated my connection with the superb, Seattle-based guitar virtuoso Hilary Field, ‘introducing’ us via emails.  Hilary''s recording of the suite prompted me to write another guitar piece specifically for her.  It’s entitled “Reluctant Farewell.”  Appropriately, it’s the final track on her latest CD, “Premieres."  I’ll share that piece with you another time.\r\n\r\n( Note:  Listening to the mp3 below, you might think the piece ends at 1:37 because HIlary has made the most of the pause I indicated at that point in the score.  Hang in there!  There’s more to come!  This reminds me of the good times I had in community theatre.  In rehearsal, my co-star paused.  I whispered, “Did you forget your line?”  “No!” she snapped.

While earning her degree in Education at the University of Cincinnati she found her passion:  teaching young, inner-city school children.\r\n\r\nA tall young woman with long dark hair and serious eyes, she briefly spoke to our congregation during last Sunday’s service.\r\n\r\n	“My students ask me what they must do to be admitted into the Juvenile Detention Center, a block from our school.  They want to go there because many of them have siblings and neighbors who have been incarcerated there and they have heard that the inmates get three square meals a day.”\r\n\r\nHunger is a constant problem for most of the 300 students of Taft Elementary, despite the school’s provision of breakfast and lunch and “a healthy take-home snack” for every student, every school day.  Emma brings baloney sandwiches to distribute to her students as well.\r\n\r\nThe very location of Taft Elementary School is replete with ironies.  The boyhood home of President William Howard Taft is two hundred yards west of the school.  Christ Hospital is across the street from the Taft home.  The Detention Center is two hundred yards south of the school.  The university is a half mile north of the school, as is our church, Mt. Auburn Presbyterian.  A half mile south lies Milton Street, where we live.\r\n\r\nEmma asked us for help.  She suggested several things, including a visit to her classroom.  She said that the only answer her students have to the question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is:  “A teacher.”  Why?  Because teaching is the only job they have ever observed anyone doing, the only job they know anything about.  She asked us to come to her classroom to tell her students about our life''s work, broadening their sense of what is possible.\r\n\r\nAt the coffee hour after the service, I told Emma that I would do that and more.  I would visit several classrooms and present an assembly for each grade level featuring music, storytelling, history and what it is to be a composer and a writer.\r\n\r\nI have a knack for communicating with kids and I’ll do my best.\r\n\r\nBut what about their hunger?  What can I do about that?\r\n\r\nThe question is, again, heavy with irony.   The school is so near the home of "Big Bill" Taft, our most well-fed (fattest) president and the only president who went on to serve, after his presidency, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  What about seeing that these children are well-fed?  What about justice for them?\r\n\r\nThe irony is personal as well.  I’m the cook at our house.  On Thanksgiving day we feasted on Roast Turkey, Dressing, Mashed Potatoes, Oyster Dressing (a Sowash family tradition), Broccoli-cherry tomato salad, Cranberries simmered in maple syrup and Amaretto, and one of my celebrated cheesecakes: a Frangelico, orange rind, milk chocolate cheese filling in a butter-bound crust of cuisinart-ed gingersnaps and cocoa powder, served with red raspberries on top.\r\n\r\nWhat did the kids enrolled at Taft Elementary, all of whom live within a mile of my house, eat on Thanksgiving Day?\r\n\r\nWhat’s to be done?  Someone rich and powerful could help; first, they must be made aware of the situation; second, they must be asked to help; third, they must act.\r\n\r\nWhat if I could command the attention of our current president and his cabinet, just long enough to tell them about the second graders who want to know what they have to do be admitted into the Detention Center so as to garner three meals a day?  What if I could ask them to do something?\r\n\r\nOur current president and his cabinet are all billionaires or millionaires, very well paid and well-pensioned.  They could easily do something to help.  But how could I reach them?  They wouldn’t let me into their offices; they wouldn’t let me attend a cabinet meeting; they wouldn’t let me speak with them on the phone.  \r\n\r\nI could write them a letter.  I’d almost certainly get back a nice, neat, boilerplate letter prepared by an aide and adorned with the digital-age equivalent of a rubber stamp signature.  If I told them I was donating money to the school’s food fund and asked them to do the same, they might praise my generosity.  If I asked them why this situation exists in the first place and suggest policy changes, they would most likely say it was a complex issue.\r\n\r\n(The Brazilian Catholic Archbishop Dom Helder Camara wrote, “When I fed the poor, they called me a saint.  When I asked why there are so many poor, they called me a communist.”)\r\n\r\nWhen I got home from church, I wrote to Representative Steve Chabot and Senator Rob Portman, sharing with them what Emma had told us.  I urged them to vote to raise the minimum wage and not to take away health insurance and health care from the poor, not to gut Medicare and the CHIP program, not to cut benefits for the needy in order to offset tax cuts for the rich.  Maybe if enough voters do the same?\r\n\r\nThe close proximity to the school of President Taft’s boyhood home has the potential to inspire the students to bring gifts of public service to the world, if they knew what a little boy who once lived in their neighborhood had become when he grew up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they are already inspired by the close proximity of the Detention Center to dream of finding some way of being admitted, thus being guaranteed three meals a day.\r\n\r\nI’m a composer; I view things a bit differently.  Here’s a little analogy that occurred to me…..\r\n\r\nHunger is intimate, unique to the person experiencing it, felt in the stomach;  it cannot be shared.  \r\n\r\nGuitar music is intimate, too.  Its vibrations are felt in the stomach as the guitarist presses her instrument against herself as she plays, most often performing for an audience of one:  herself.  Unlike hunger, guitar music can be shared.\r\n\r\nI titled my only guitar suite "For an Old Friend at Christmas."  I invite you to hear the final movement played with great sensitivity and compassion by the Seattle-based guitar virtuoso Hilary Field.\r\n\r\nTo hear her rendition, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),158);

Sometimes at home I watch DVDs of movies I don''t even like, parts of which positively make me squirm, just so that I can hear, again, a great film score; "The Ten Commandments," "Now, Voyager," and "How The West Was Won," and others.\r\n\r\nI''ve never written a film score, though tracks from my CDs have been featured in several documentaries.  \r\n\r\nOf course, there''s nothing to stop a composer from writing a film score, even without a film. Back in 1979, I did just that.\r\n\r\nWilliam Huggins, a lawyer and amateur violinist in Columbus, OH, commissioned me to write a piece he could perform with friends who played the flute, French horn and harpsichord. Considering the antique sound of the harpsichord and the heroic sound of the horn, I looked to medieval literature for inspiration.  \r\n\r\n"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" is an anonymous masterwork of 14th-century England.  I love this tale and have read it many times.  Not in the original Middle English; only scholars can do that.  I''ve read several translations and for my money the best is J.R.R. Tolkien''s; it''s funny, spooky, mystical.  Reading it, I felt the presence of a master storyteller, wise and wry.\r\n\r\nI thought, "What if there was a film version of this exciting, ambiguous, lovely story?  What would a suitable film score sound like?"  I set to work, devising five movements that could underscore the major scenes of the tale.\r\n	\r\nThe third movement depicts the heroic knight, Sir Gawain, riding merrily through a gloomy, medieval landscape.  It''s entitled "Gawain''s Journey."\r\n\r\nHere''s Tolkien''s rendering of that scene:\r\n\r\nBy a mount in the morning merrily he was riding\r\ninto a forest that was deep and fearsomely wild,\r\nwith high hills at each hand, and hoar woods beneath\r\nof huge aged oaks by the hundred together ....\r\n\r\nSo many a marvel in the mountains he met in those lands\r\nthat ''twould be tedious the tenth part to tell you thereof.\r\nAt whiles with worms he wars, and with wolves also,\r\nat whiles with wood-trolls that wandered in the crags,\r\nand with bulls and with bears and boars, too, at times;\r\nand with ogres that hounded him from the heights of the fells.\r\nHad he not been stalwart and staunch and steadfast in God,\r\nhe doubtless would have died and death had met often.\r\n\r\nBill Huggins and his friends played the piece enthusiastically but it was never performed by anyone else because the combination of instruments was so unusual.  In 2011, I revised and re-scored the piece for piano trio plus trumpet, an ensemble much easier to assemble.\r\n\r\nTo hear Gawain’s Journey performed wit and gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSept. 7, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nCincinnati, the Queen City, has whimsy.  It’s her most lovable trait.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard about Green Man Park, the city’s newest, I bicycled over to the Walnut Hills neighborhood to take a look at it.  An empty lot on McMillan Street has been transformed into a public green space, featuring a seven-foot tall sculpted stone “Green Man."\r\n\r\nDo you know about The Green Man?\r\n\r\nYou’ve seen his face, carved, drawn or painted, fashioned from herbaceous shapes.   Twining vines comprise his hair, beard, eyebrows and mustache.  From a thicket of leafy shrubbery, he peers out at you; his eyes are intense, his expression unreadable.  Is he amused or menacing?  Or both?  Hard to say.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn’t sound familiar, google “Green Man,” select ‘images’ and you’ll see him, quickly enough.  (What times we live in, when it is so easy to do such things!)\r\n\r\nThe carvers who adorned medieval cathedrals routinely rendered depictions of familiar Biblical figures, positioning the likes of Jesus, Joseph, Mary and Moses in lofty niches, plainly visible to the priests and congregations below.  But higher yet, way back in the shadowy rafters, hidden from view, some of them covertly carved images of The Green Man.\r\n\r\nWhy hidden from view?  Because The Green Man was a pagan remnant; he predated Christianity by thousands of years.  The carvers deemed it necessary to include a hidden Green Man in a space that was going to be regarded as sacred for centuries to come.  Knowing the clergy would not approve, the carvers did this work in secret.\r\n\r\nThe Green Man is often understood as a symbol of the cycle of growth, death, decay and rebirth.  That’s plenty to think about ... but there is much more.  \r\n\r\nHe raises questions about our relationship with Nature.  Is Nature, in any sense, a mirror?   When we gaze into a welter of leaves, shrubs and vines, is there, however figuratively, a human face, there in the foliage, gazing back at us?  \r\n\r\nDoes Nature, carefully scrutinized, display any aspects of humanity?   Which?  How?  Why?  \r\n\r\nThe Green Man seems to assert that we humans, too, are part of Nature.  If we believe that, then how shall we order our lives?  How well are we doing?  How healthy is our relationship with Nature?   \r\n\r\nThe Green Man seems poised to address such questions, yet he has no voice; he is only a mute icon after all.  His image, whether carven, drawn, or painted, is wordless and moveless.  Does he have anything to teach us?  Does Nature have anything to teach us?  What?  A warning?  An admonishment?  An inspiration?\r\n\r\nWhy is this figure always male?  Does he give the lie to “Mother Nature?” and “Mother Earth?”\r\n\r\nI have no answers for such questions.  But I love The Green Man.  He prompts us to think!\r\n\r\nThe enormous sculpture newly mounted in Green Man Park was carved by one David Hummel, back in 1890, to ornament a building in Walnut Hills.\r\n\r\nA century later, in 1991, when the building was about to be demolished, the sculpture was rescued by a concerned citizen (who apparently prefers to remain anonymous) and was stored in obscurity for twenty-five years, almost forgotten. \r\n\r\nHow fitting it is that now, at last, comes The Green Man''s resurrection and rebirth as the centerpiece of his own little park, here in our whimsical city.\r\n\r\nThe Green Man appears in literature, too, most notably as the Green Knight in an anonymous literary masterwork of 14th-century England, "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.”  There he is not mute and moveless;  he says and does things!  He speaks forcefully, albeit ambiguously.  His actions are bold but his motives are obscure.  Existing outside the human realm, the Green Knight’s purposes are obscure.  \r\n\r\nI love this poem and have read it many times.  My favorite translation (the original is written in an obscure dialect of ancient English) is the one by J.R.R. Tolkien; it''s funny, spooky, mystical, crafted by a master who knows how to tell a story.  \r\n\r\nIn 1979, I wrote a five-movement suite depicting scenes and characters from the poem, revising and re-scoring it for trumpet, violin, cello and piano in 2011.  \r\n\r\nSir Gawain is the hero of the tale but since the Green Knight dominates the opening and closing scenes, I let him have the final movement all to himself.\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement, entitled “The Green Knight,” performed with heroic gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nAugust 7, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA visitor at the Cincinnati Art Museum seemed almost too interested in our famous Van Gogh.  He was inclining his head almost too close to the precious painting, one of the artist''s very last, and his hands were twitching.\r\n\r\nEver the professional museum guard, dutiful and discreet, I quickly edged closer to him.  Oddly, the painting’s ornate frame seemed to interest him far more than the painting itself.  He raised his fist, curled as if to knock on a door, drawing even nearer this priceless, beautiful artwork.  Too close!\r\n\r\nTaking my cue from Byron’s Assyrian, I “came down like the wolf on the fold,” burbling a forceful “Ahem!” as I drew near.\r\n\r\nHe spun toward me, demanding to know: “May I tap this frame?”  Pantomiming a tapping action in mid-air with his fist, he added, “Like this? Tap! Tap! Tap!”\r\n\r\n“To that,” I replied, firm but friendly, wagging my forefinger, “I must say, “No! No! No!”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, normal after all.  He was a frame-maker, he explained, wondering if the carved wooden frame was solid or veneer and that he could tell by tapping.  I referred him to the Curatorial Department; that was the last I heard of the matter.\r\n\r\nA frame can be a thing of great beauty, complementing the canvas it encases.  Frame-makers are artists (though we’d probably dodge a museum exhibiting only empty frames).\r\n\r\nSome artists make their own frames.  Grant Wood made the frame for his sardonic “Daughters of Revolution,” also on display at the CAM, I’m proud to say.\r\n\r\nComposers are sometimes framer-makers, too.  I’ve devised ‘frames’ for some of my pieces, beginning and ending with music that is separate from, yet complements, the main content of the piece.  \r\n\r\nYou’re invited to listen to an example of this; to wit, the first movement of my suite for violin, trumpet, cello and piano, “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight:  A Christmas Legend.”  The movement has its own title, too:  “Arthur’s Court at Christmas.”  \r\n\r\nThe introduction is a courtly fanfare, a little reminiscent of the unrivaled gem of a fanfare Franz Waxman penned for 20th Century Fox.  My introductory fanfare recurs at the end of the movement … thus, the fanfare serves as both an introduction and an “outro-duction,” to coin a word.  A musical frame, so to speak. One music framing another music.\r\n\r\n(Speaking of intro-ductions vs. outro-ductions, is an Under-ture the opposite of an Overture?  What’s the opposite of an Introit?  A DE-troit?)\r\n\r\nThe fanfare-introduction takes 21 seconds.  Then the piece gets down to business, chortling merrily along, all Christmas-y and quasi-medieval-ly.  At 5:15, the music has said what it has to say.  The “outro-duction” is now sounded, a  25-second modified repeat of the opening fanfare.\r\n\r\nVoilà!  The piece has a frame!\r\n\r\nJust as a well-conceived frame complements a painting, my fanfare grabs attention, establishes a storytelling mood and evokes an ancient and fantastical setting.  It readies us for the entry of noble King Arthur and his splendiferous court and, at the end, bids a fond farewell to the whole kit-and-kaboodle.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Arthur’s Court at Christmas” from my suite “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," performed with heroic gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 18, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAlmost every day, at odd moments, I am visited by troubling memories of moments, some recent, some from long ago, when I have behaved badly, said stupid, hurtful things, missed opportunities to be gracious and kind, falling far short of being the sort of person I want to be, humiliating myself instead.  \r\n\r\nI drive away these futile and soul-devouring regrets as best I can, forcing myself to remember the good things I’ve occasionally managed to get said and done and to appreciate the fact that, if we will allow it, humiliation can lead to wisdom.\r\n\r\nHopefully, we learn, albeit the hard way, not to make that particular mistake again, meanwhile making new ones.  Such experiences remind us that we all fall short, we all betray our ethical standards, however ardently we strive to embrace them.\r\n\r\nThat’s the implied moral of "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," an anonymous 14th-century story-poem from western England.  I love it and have read it many times, though not in the original, written in an arcane dialect of Middle English which only scholars can parse.  I like J.R.R. Tolkien’s translation into plain English; it''s funny, spooky, mystical, wise and wry.  Tolkien knows how to tell a story.\r\n\r\nGawain is the perfect knight.  Even so, he furtively allows a fair lady to gift him with a supposedly magical garment, said to render invincible whoever wears it.  Then he breaks a promise by concealing from the lady''s husband the fact of his having accepted her gift.\r\n\r\nKnowing he will face certain death the next day, Gawain puts his desire to live, to escape death by any means possible, above his code of ethics.  Which of us would not?  \r\n\r\nLater, dramatically confronted with his failure, Gawain is humiliated.  However, from that moment on, he is wise.  He has discovered that no one is perfect, not even himself, the very best knight at Arthur’s Round Table.\r\n\r\nWhen I undertook to write a suite of music depicting various scenes in Sir Gawain’s adventure, I found myself straying far from my usual musical stomping grounds.\r\n\r\nSince you’ve kindly allowed me to send you these messages for a while now, you know quite a lot about my music.  It’s often about the changing seasons, the bucolic landscapes of the American Midwest and other places I’ve visited.  My music is usually cheerful and optimistic, affirming humane values and the sweetness of life, lulling listeners into a roseate trance.  At least that’s how much of it seems to me.\r\n\r\nDevising suitable music for “Sir Gawain” led me to think outside that box.  It’s one thing to write music about wild flowers, dark forests and sunsets, but how can abstractions like Humiliation and Wisdom be ‘music-ified?’  What music could trace a progression from Humiliation to Wisdom?  Questions like that can raise creativity from a simmer to a boil.\r\n\r\nTo hear a beautiful rendering of what I came up with, played with great depth of feeling by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 23, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThough tracks from my CDs have served as background music in a few documentaries, I''ve not had the opportunity to score a film from scratch.  \r\n\r\nThat didn’t stop me from testing my mettle as a film score composer.  \r\n\r\nWilliam Huggins, an amateur violinist, commissioned me to write a piece he could perform with friends who played the flute, French horn and harpsichord.  It was my first commission and I took it seriously.  He offered me $100 and I was thrilled.  It was 1979 and my annual salary was $11,000.  \r\n\r\nConsidering the antique sound of the harpsichord and the heroic sound of the French horn, I sought inspiration in "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” a masterpiece of medieval literature I had studied in college.  (My B.S. is ''a double-major'' in Music Composition and Comparative Literature.).  \r\n\r\nI love this anonymous 14th-century tale.  It’s written in a dialect of medieval English, which I cannot read, but I''ve read several translations and for my money the best is J.R.R. Tolkien''s; it''s funny, spooky, mystical.  Read it and you put yourself under the spell of a master storyteller, wise and wry.\r\n\r\nCreative work begins with questions.  I asked myself, "What if there was a film version of this story?  What would a suitable film score sound like?”  \r\n\r\nI set to work, devising five movements that could serve as background music during the story''s major scenes, should they be rendered in celluloid and projected onto a screen.  \r\n	\r\nThe third movement, "Gawain''s Journey," depicts the hero riding boldly through a wild and gloomy landscape. \r\n\r\nHere is Tolkien''s rendering of that passage.  (If he seems to you to be laying on the alliteration too thickly, you need to know that the original alliterates at the same pace; there are two or three and sometimes four alliterations in every line of this sixty-page poem; it’s part of the fun.):\r\n\r\n	By a mount in the morning merrily he was riding\r\n	into a forest that was deep and fearsomely wild,\r\n	with high hills at each hand, and hoar woods beneath\r\n	of huge aged oaks by the hundred together ....\r\n\r\n	So many a marvel in the mountains he met in those lands\r\n	that ''twould be tedious the tenth part to tell you thereof.\r\n	At whiles with worms he wars, and with wolves also,\r\n	at whiles with wood-trolls that wandered in the crags,\r\n	and with bulls and with bears and boars, too, at times;\r\n	and with ogres that hounded him from the heights of the fells.\r\n	Had he not been stalwart and staunch and steadfast in God,\r\n	he doubtless would have died and death had met often.\r\n\r\nThe music I wrote for this scene and others doesn’t sound like the of the Middle Ages.  Rather, it evokes the scores of films that take place during that era.  The piece is a bridge connecting Hollywood with chamber music.\r\n\r\nBill Huggins and his friends played the piece enthusiastically but it was never performed by anyone else because the combination of instruments was so unusual.  There are no violin-flute-French horn-harpsichord quartets looking for something they can play together.  My piece was a ‘white elephant.’  A lot of good music was trapped in the suite and would never be heard unless it was re-scored for a different and more likely ensemble.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, I revised and re-scored the piece for piano trio + trumpet, an ensemble much easier to assemble.  My friend and fan, pianist Greg Kostraba, pulled together such a quartet and recorded the piece, beautifully!  At last, my “Sir Gawain" music was unbound and now lives in the world!\r\n\r\nTo hear Gawain’s Journey performed wit and gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),64);

After moving here in 1994 (so that our two children could attend the city''s celebrated School for the Creative and Performing Arts), I was shocked to find that when I mentioned ‘The Lake,’ people asked me, "What lake?"\r\n\r\nWhat lake?  Were they kidding?  To a northern Ohioan there is only one lake.  ‘The Lake.’  Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nHere in Cincinnati it''s ‘The River.’  The Ohio River.  If Cincinnatians mentioned ‘the river’ and I asked, "What river?" they would think I was kidding.\r\n\r\nSeveral generations of Sowashes passed many happy summers on the shores of Lake Erie, in Lakeside, a Chautauqua resort near Sandusky.  For a while, our family even had a cottage there and a small sailboat in which I ventured to Kelly''s Island and elsewhere, exploring the waters where Oliver Hazard Perry defeated the British Navy at the Battle of Lake Erie.  To this day, northern Ohioans take pride in that victory, which proved a much-needed morale-booster for our side in the War of 1812. \r\n\r\nOnce, strange to tell, on a very windy day, sailing with my ten-year-old nephew, our little craft floundered.  Despite a hard-blowing wind, we were just bobbing around, not going anywhere. How could that be?  \r\n\r\nI looked around.   Was there something wrong with the rudder?  the keel?  No.  Looking up, I discovered the problem:  the sail had come loose from the top of the mast.  I could not climb the mast to repair it.  We were a long way from shore.  There was only one thing to do.  \r\n\r\nWe slid into the water and dog-paddled, buoyed by our life-jackets, tugging behind us a rope attached to the sailboat.  At length we landed on one of the many tiny, unnamed islands in the waters rendered glorious by O.H. Perry.  We beached our boat, shipwrecked on a desert island!  We tipped the boat on its side and used our shoelaces to fasten the sail back onto the mast and then sailed back to Lakeside in triumph, with a story to tell!  My nephew was beaming with joy!  He''d had a real adventure!\r\n\r\nEven now and then, here in Cincinnati, in this humid valley carved by ‘The River’ so long ago, I step outside to find that the wind is brisk and fast, the air dry and clear.  Yesterday morning was like that, a clear September day.  At such moments, though we''ve lived in the Queen City for twenty years, though I''ve not set foot in a sailboat in all that time, I always think, "Ah!  A perfect day for sailing!"\r\n\r\nThat''s the subtitle I gave to the third movement of Anecdotes and Reflections (1989), my concertino for violin, clarinet, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nTo hear "A Perfect Day for Sailing" played by clarinetist Craig Olzenak with the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSept. 21, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIt’s the weekend of the Glorious Fourth.  Marches by the incomparable John Philip Sousa will be heard in parades, concerts and broadcasts across America.\r\n\r\nSousa truly is The March King, the unrivaled master of his genre.  For the sheer zest of his tunes, for his ability to start toes tapping, for his knack of inducing crowds to hysterical cheering, for the images that leap to mind whenever his music is heard — flags waving, athletes, candidates, confetti — let us give thanks for and pay homage to John Philip Sousa.\r\n\r\nMy own tribute to Sousa is the sixth and final movement of my longest work:  Anecdotes and Reflections.  It’s my attempt at a portrait of America, celebrating our exuberance, our energy, our sense of ourselves as the great Melting Pot, our tradition of tolerance and our capacity to embrace and rejoice in our diversity.\r\n\r\n(I am not blind to our problems;  there is much to deplore.  One way of responding to Evil is to celebrate what is good.)\r\n\r\nThis music was composed in 1989, commissioned by Chamber Music in Yellow Springs, Inc., of Yellow Springs, Ohio, in memory of a founder of the organization, Louise Betcher.  \r\n\r\nMy Sousa tribute ends with a tune borrowed from the Master''s great “Liberty Bell March.”  Sousa’s tune is given a twist or two, but you may recognize it.  (Composers are allowed to borrow from one another, did you know?)\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak''s exuberant rendition of the final movement from “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 5, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA young composer sent me an mp3 recording and a PDF of the score of a piece he had written, asking my opinion of the music.  \r\n\r\nI dislike the role of a judge.  As if music is a contest and I’m somehow qualified to separate the winners from the losers.  I hate contests that pretend to have the ability to judge creativity, a thing which cannot even be measured let alone presented Gold, Silver or Bronze medals.\r\n\r\nI admire what Charles Ives said when informed that he had won the Pulitzer Prize for Music:  “Prizes are for boys,” he said.  "I’m grown up."\r\n\r\nContrariwise, I’m very glad to share with composers what I have figured out about the career aspects of the craft.  I have a lot to offer in response to queries such as, “How do I get my music performed?  How can I get my music recorded and broadcast on classical music radio stations?  Shall I publish my own scores or try to find a ‘real’ publisher?  Shall I produce my own CDs or try to find a ‘real’ record label?”  \r\n\r\nBut I dislike being asked to pronounce upon the quality of the music itself.  Who am I to judge someone’s music?  Who is anyone?  Each of us is ‘just another listener.''\r\n\r\nStill, I don’t want to be churlish.  I admire the young composer having the pluck to ask me.  When I was young, a wise man once imparted to me a simple truth:  “If you don’t ask questions, you don’t get answers.”  \r\n\r\nI’ve asked a lot of questions and I am grateful to those who offered some answers.  \r\n\r\nThat’s why, with a heavy sigh and a burdensome sense of obligation, I clicked on the mp3 the composer had sent me and listened.\r\n\r\nMarvelous, right off the bat!  Light, crisp and as fresh as if it was just back from the cleaners!  Syncopated, lively, delightful!  \r\n\r\nI kept listening.  More light, crisp, fresh music.  More lively syncopations.  Then yet more.  After that, more.  When that was over, more.  Ugh.\r\n\r\nThere was never a hint of contrast.  The piece was stuck in a light, crisp, fresh little world that soon lost my interest.  I stuck it out to the end but my initial delight dwindled into tedium because the music never found its shadow, never acknowledged its opposite, its dark twin.   Thus, it developed into wisdom.  That’s an allusion to something Robert Frost said, that a poem should “begin in delight and end in wisdom.”  That goes for music, too.\r\n\r\nOf course, I sent an encouraging reply to the young composer.  I told him the truth: that I’d found the music to be light, crisp, fresh, lively, delightful.  But that’s all I told him.  I let it go at that.  I didn''t want to be a jerk.\r\n\r\nHere’s the thing.  Any piece of music must begin in a certain place and then either 1) go someplace else and eventually return or 2) stop pretty soon and be followed by music in a different mood, key, tempo, i.e., a contrasting movement or section which must, in turn, either go someplace else and return or stop and be followed by yet another different mood, key, tempo, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen music begins in a certain place and then goes someplace else, well, the interesting question is how FAR away will it go from where it started?  Is there a limit?  If a composer goes TOO far away from where he started, will listeners think he’s schizophrenic?  Is there some way to link two extremely disparate musics so that they remain true to the soul of the composer holding the figurative pen in hand as the work was coming into being?\r\n\r\nIf I were a little bolder, I’d have asked that young composer to do what I am asking YOU to do now … to listen to the fifth movement of my “Anecdotes & Reflections" for violin, clarinet, cello and piano.  This piece “goes someplace else,” that’s for sure.  No other movement in all my 400 works contains such extremely opposite musics as this one.\r\n\r\nPlease, let me walk you through it.  If you want to listen WHILE you are reading the following, click on the link above.\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/anec_ref.5.mp3\r\n\r\nIt begins and ends with a ten-second “frame.”  Like a painting, the music is bordered, defined, enclosed by its frame.\r\n\r\nAt second eleven (0:11) the tune commences and you immediately know that you are, musically, in a particular spot.  The piano, all by itself, plays a slow, wistful, mysterious dance music, repeating it fully four times, joined first by the violin, then by the violin AND the cello, finally by the violin, the cello AND the clarinet.  \r\n\r\nSo far the music, though very beautiful, seems to be ’stuck’ in that place.  Hopefully, it is so beautiful that you don’t mind lingering.  Patience!  \r\n\r\nSure enough, at precisely 3:32 we hear “the frame” again, the one that commenced the movement.\r\n\r\nBut at 3:53 something different begins!  A different key, meter, mood … \r\n\r\nFor some reason, this music has always made me think of Christmas, especially when it gets to 4:53.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of “going someplace else.”  One is the “wrong note.”\r\n\r\nListen carefully at 5:21 for the very long, very high “wrong note” in the violin.  It persists for so long that it finally becomes the “right note” after all!\r\n\r\nThe “Christmas” section begins to wind down at 6:21 with a calm, repetitive figure\r\n\r\nSuddenly! at 6:59 the “Christmas” tune is utterly transformed into, of all things, an old-time, jazzy tune, reminiscent of Benny Goodman, Djano Rinehart, Duke Ellington.  Musically, we’ve reached the extreme opposite of where the movement started.\r\n\r\nThe jazzy section concludes beginning at 9:04 with a feeling of “One mo’ time, folks!”  I picture a vaudeville performer singing, dancing, grimacing and waving his straw boater hat at the audience.\r\n\r\nA quick transformation follows … we’re back to “Christmas” music in its original form, but now in a minor key … \r\n\r\nThen the “frame” is heard again and at 9:47, the music returns to the sad and stately dance we heard at the beginng … but this time with the jazzy tune,modified, calmed down, heard in the clarinet.  \r\n\r\nAt the end, the two disparate musics embrace.  The reconciliation of opposites has been achieved.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the “frame,” heard at 10:34, to bring closure.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak''s alternately sensitive and exuberant rendition of the fifth movement from “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThere were about a hundred friends and fans on my list of recipients for these weekly emails when I began sending them, almost four years ago.  Y’all sometimes forwarded them to your friends, many of whom subsequently signed up, swelling the number of recipients to 600 plus.\r\n\r\nThough replies are not expected, I’m pleased when some of you occasionally respond with your thoughts and I always reply in turn.  \r\n\r\nOne friend recently responded with this observation:\r\n\r\n	<< I have noticed something (and I''m sure I''m not the only one) consistent in your music, almost like a signature.  It''s that four-note descending figure, most prominent I think in your "Anecdotes & Reflections."  How did it come to you, and why is it so prevalent in your works?\r\n	I have played a small handful of your pieces, listened to dozens more, and could probably at this point pick your music out of a crowd by style alone. But that four-note motif would seal the deal instantly if I was at all unsure. >>\r\n\r\nHe’s right.  There IS a certain four-note shape that has inspired a great deal of my music. \r\n\r\nIf I could sit down with you at a piano and take you inside that shape by playing it for you, I’m pretty sure you’d find enthrallment was in store.\r\n\r\nDo you recall, when you were little, holding a glass marble very close to your eye and then tilting your head toward the sky to view the brightly illumined universe inside?  I remember one particular marble -- a "boulder" as we used to call the big ones -- it was a rich indigo blue, marbleized with creamy-white stripes.  I was amazed to look inside; it seemed to open up infinitely.  When I see photos of galaxies and nebulae I feel again what I felt when I peered inside that marble.\r\n\r\nSigh.  I wonder if any American kids still play with marbles.  \r\n\r\nWell, for me this little four-note musical shape has been like that marble.  When I peered ''inside'' it, an immense range of possibilities opened.  Even though I explored it for about twenty-five years, there are vast reaches still waiting to be discovered.  It pops up in almost all of the works I''ve written in the second half of my career.\r\n\r\nOne of the many meanings it has for me is something like a signature, as when a painter signs a painting.  It’s like that squiggle of red letters down in the right hand corner, “Monet.”  The little shape functions exactly thus at the very end of both of the "Two Self-Portraits" that comprise my Trio #8 for clarinet, cello and piano.  It''s my way of inserting an autograph into the very body of the music.  \r\n\r\nThe little shape is autobiographical, a musical genome.  At a piano, I could show you how the sound of the shape is, at once, French and American, an indication of my genealogical and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThe shape can be indicated as these notes, descending:    A - G - E - E flat (or D sharp, ''same diff'').   \r\n\r\nPlayed forwards, backwards, right-side-up or upside-down, it is mysterious, sensual, blues-y.  It is imbued with tension because it yearns with equal passion to move in opposite directions on the circle of fifths.  In the example I gave above, it seems to indicate an A7 chord with a flatted fifth, which wants to drop to a D in the circle of fifths.  But the E flat belies that, seeming to indicate a E flat 7 chord with a flatted fifth, pointing in the opposite direction, up to an A flat.\r\n\r\nIt seems alive to me, human, because — have you noticed? — we humans also yearn with equal passion to move in opposite directions.  \r\n\r\nThe first three notes are pentatonic, expressing certitude, purity, simplicity, but the fourth note introduces the ambiguous tri-tone, expressing doubt.  The first three notes are lulling and cozy; the fourth note is the ‘wrong’ note, chromatic, sensual, jazzy, sinister, comical, problematic; its trajectory is aimed “outside the box.”  The first three notes offer three cheers for the faithful husband, solid and dependable if a bit stodgy; the fourth note turns his head; he is not incognizant of the mezzo’s dimples, hazel eyes and long, chestnut hair.\r\n\r\nThe fourth note is like a thimbleful of grenadine dropped into a beaker of clear water — clear, sterile and colorless — clear, that is, until tinged, clouded and infused by the spreading, smoky thimbleful.\r\n\r\nWhen I played or sang that four-note shape, employing as the opening note each degree of a major or minor scale, melodies gushed forth.  It was as if, hiking, thirsty and hot, I had discovered a cool spring on a mountain side.\r\n\r\nThe shape was particularly helpful at pivotal moments, the “seams” that separate the tunes and sections of a piece of music.  When I felt I’d lingered almost too long in one tonality, the shape was always there, a catalyst, ready to bounce the music into another tonality, new and fresh.\r\n\r\nWhere did it come from?  It’s the first four notes of a descending “Blues” scale, which gives it a jazzy sound.  But that’s not where I found it.  Years ago, I attended a conference of choral composers organized by Gregg Smith, director of the celebrated Gregg Smith Singers.  One of the pieces by another of the composers at the conference began with this intriguing four-note shape.  I heard it once and the seed was planted.  I recall the names of neither the piece, nor the composer, though I remember that I didn’t like the piece because it scarcely sampled the enormous potential I heard in those notes.  \r\n\r\nYears later a friend pointed out that the same four-note shape occurs, just once, in the “Two Pictures” by Bartok.  I listened and, sure enough, there it is.  But I had been exploring the potentialities of the shape for about fifteen years by then and had never heard the Bartok piece.  I did not borrow it from Bartok.\r\n\r\nThis shape came to me at precisely the right time in my life.  In my twenties and early thirties, I had achieved a vibrant, pastoral style, evocative of the Ohio countryside and the quiet village life I’d known.  Increasingly, that style had come to seem less honest to me.  I felt I was plagiarizing myself, writing “the sort of music Rick Sowash would write” rather than writing music that truly expressed my experience.  \r\n\r\nBut when I tried to force alien, non-pastoral elements into my music, such as diminished seventh chords or weird modes, the result was phonus bolonus.  I longed to deepen the pastoral style, to find a door through it rather than abandoning it altogether.\r\n\r\nThat 4-note shape proved to be the mysterious little door I sought.  \r\n\r\nAt 41 minutes, “Anecdotes & Reflections” is my longest work and an extended exploration of that four-note shape.  Today I invite you to listen to the first movement.  It begins with a repeated “A” thumping energetically in the piano.  The clarinet enters playing -- you guessed ‘er, Chester! —  the first statement of the four-note shape, the first of hundreds that will recur throughout the six movements of the work.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak''s exuberant rendition of the first movement of “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nPaintings are framed.  \r\n\r\nPoems are framed -- above, below and on both sides —  by the broad margins of the page.  \r\n\r\nA play is framed by what happens in the theatre before the curtain rises and by what happens after the curtain falls, transiting the audience away from reality before the play and back to reality afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe frames surrounding paintings, poems and plays are more or less symmetrical.\r\n\r\nNot so, when music is framed.\r\n\r\nWe don’t want to hear a long introduction repeated in its entirety because, well, we’ve already heard it.  Once is enough.  When a piece is ending, a brief reminder of the introduction will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet solo that opens the fourth movement of the suite I named “Anecdotes and Reflections” grew from a vocal setting I’d made of Robert Frost’s poem, “Nothing Gold Can Stay.”   \r\n\r\nThe clarinet ‘sings’ the famous opening line of the poem, “Nature’s first green is gold.”  On the word “gold” you’ll hear the clarinet playing the descending four-note Blues figure out of which the rest of the piece grows, so that it comes across like this:  “Nature’s first green is go-o-o-old.”\r\n\r\nAs the clarinet solo ends, the piano enters and an image of a river — flowing water pressing itself upon stone — is offered at 1:25, the pianist’s right hand playing a rippling figure, glittering and golden, while the dark cello evokes the breadth and depth of the water, the glistening sheen of the violin answering in canon above, the pianist’s left hand evoking the bedrock beneath the current.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet’s opening, compressed into a single phrase, recurs at 2:42, drawing the music to its conclusion, ending, as Frost ends his brief, powerful poem, sadly yet wisely:  “Nothing gold can stay."\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen and clarinetist Craig Olzenak) expertly performing the first movement of “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),68);

I read one and found myself gazing out the window, thinking hard about it for twenty minutes before turning to the next.  \r\n\r\nThis ambiguous little book, written 600 years before Jesus, seemed to address the most pressing particulars of my life at that time; in all the years since, it has often helped me to think about whatever is going on in my life, in my family, in our country or in the world.\r\n\r\nI kept a slim copy in my pocket when I was working as a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum.  On snowy days or late summer afternoons when the galleries are empty, I would read a few pages, pondering them anew.  I especially loved to peruse it when I was guarding the Asian galleries.  \r\n\r\nHere are a few of the many lines I''ve pondered, long and hard:\r\n\r\nHe who has power over others\r\ncan''t empower himself.     (Oh?  Why is that?)\r\n\r\nIf you realize that you have enough,\r\nyou are truly rich.     (Ah, but how much is enough?  how rich is truly rich?)\r\n\r\nThe more he [the Master] gives to others,\r\nthe wealthier he is.     (wealthier in what sense?)\r\n\r\nSuccess or failure: which is more dangerous?     (what dangers come to mind?)\r\n\r\nGive evil nothing to oppose\r\nand it will disappear by itself.     (what about Hitler?  Stalin? would Gandhi agree?)\r\n\r\nCare about people''s approval\r\nand you will be their prisoner.     (how exactly?  what about approval of family, friends?)\r\n\r\nDo your work.  Then step back.\r\nThe only path to serenity.     (a day''s work?  a life''s work?  why is it the only path?)\r\n\r\nInevitably, I started setting to music thoughts from the Tao Te Ching.  One of these was #12. Here it is:  \r\n\r\nColors blind the eye.\r\nSounds deafen the ear.\r\nFlavors numb the taste.\r\nThoughts weaken the mind.\r\nDesires wither the heart.\r\n\r\nThe Master observes the world\r\nbut trusts his inner vision.\r\nHe allows things to come and go.\r\nHis heart is open as the sky.\r\n\r\nOne can think for a long, long time about these words.  Is it a caution against hedonism?  Are we being warned not to be led and shaped only by our senses, thoughts, desires?  We’re told to trust our inner vision, to let things come and go and become as open as the sky.  What does this mean, practically?\r\n\r\nBut look again!  We''re not told to do anything.  We''re simply told what the Master does and that the Master''s heart is open.  Are we to do likewise?  Do we want to be a Master?  A Master of what, exactly?  Hearts open to what, precisely?  \r\n\r\nThink!  Think!  Think!  \r\n\r\nSee what I mean?\r\n\r\nI''d love to share much more about this remarkable little book ... it offers profound advice for artists ... it offers counsel about governance of self, family, nation ... it explores the idea of ''action through non-action'' ... it speaks about personal finances ... it offers glimpses into mystical experience ... and there is humor in the book as well! ... but I’ve already gone on too long.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(36,replace(replace('It''s immensely satisfying to share my work in these little essays with the people about whom I care most.  It’s a harvest at the end of a long career.  Without realizing it, I have been working toward the psychological capacity to share my life''s work in this way ever since I started composing fifty years ago.   It feels just right for me now that I''m in my mid-sixties.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, our culture was developing the technical capacity for this means of sharing.  What times we live in, when I can write these words and you can access them, so easily!  \r\n\r\nI''ve tried sharing my work in many other ways:  producing CDs and trying to get people to buy and listen ...  coaxing radio stations to broadcast my CDs ...  publishing and marketing the sheet music for my scores ...  cajoling musicians to perform my work and pressing friends to attend a concert.  None has been so effective and satisfying as devising these essays and sending them to people like yourself, via email.\r\n\r\nThe best thing is that you, as a recipient, have options:  listen immediately or save the message until you have leisure to listen ... or delete it unheard.  If you never get around to listening to the music, my feelings won''t be hurt -- because I’ll never know!   \r\n\r\nThe second best thing is:  no commercialism.  Nothing is being sold in these essays, no donations are solicited -- or ever will be.  My music came to me for free, after all;  at last I’ve found a way to share it for free.  \r\n\r\nToday, I’m passing out free French Toast.  That''s the name of the second movement of my suite entitled, A Little Breakfast Music .  I wrote this music in 1976 for two couples, friends who played oboe, clarinet and violin.  I wanted to give my friends some music the four of them could play together; there is no repertoire for that combination of instruments.  The absence of a bass instrument and the subject of breakfast called for a light, supple music.  Music that is sprightly, nimble, delightful.\r\n\r\nFrench Toast is not French (in France, they call it pain perdu which means “lost bread,” i.e., stale bread, because French toast is always better if the bread you’re using is stale). but including that entrée in this suite gave me an excuse to write music that would sound French, music influenced by those charming French composers:  Ibert, Francaix and Poulenc.\r\n\r\nThe influence is legitimate because I am the descendent of French immigrants.  My French Huguenot ancestors arrived in Boston in 1737.  Paul Revere and Davy Crockett were also descended from Huguenots.  Good company!  \r\n\r\nThat was a long time ago, but I love to think that, in my heart, I remain a Frenchman.  It''s one of my folies.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement, "French Toast," from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 5, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIn 1976, not long out of Music School, I wrote a suite for four friends who played treble clef instruments — an oboist, a clarinetist and two violinists.  With no bass instrument, the content of the piece had to be light-weight.  Usually “light classical” is the term applied to comic operettas, but this is a chamber work, entitled A Little Breakfast Music. Each of the five movements depicts an item we’d be likely to eat for breakfast.\r\n\r\nYou’re invited to partake of the last movement:  “Honey on English Muffins.”  Duration:  7 minutes, 22 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe movement opens in  4/4  with the sweetest, syrupy-est tune I could conceive, fashioned entirely from rising sixths.  That’s the “Honey” music, a ‘honey’ of a tune.   \r\n\r\nNext come the English muffins.  At 1:55 the meter changes to 6/8 and the musical style turns English.  We hear a country jig in the manner of Ralph Vaughan Williams (a British composer whose work I admire).\r\n\r\nThe music jigs happily along, moving in and out of various keys, major and minor.\r\n\r\nThen, at 6:30 the “Honey” music returns and is heard simultaneously with the English jig.  Both tunes are sounded at once as the honey is poured onto the muffin.\r\n\r\nVoilà!  Enjoy!\r\n\r\nI love this piece for its tunefulness and because it expresses the exuberance of a 26-year-old composer, free at last from the constraints of Academe, writing what he likes, with no professors or fellow composition students looking over his shoulder.  He has found his authentic voice and is having a blast, discovering what all he has to say.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Honey on English Muffins” from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook (recorded on my CD A Portrait at 50), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJan. 10, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nYears ago, on NPR, I heard a scientist say, "Half the battle is asking the right question."\r\n\r\nIt''s also true of creative work.  When artists ask themselves intriguing questions, creative ideas come a-tumbling.\r\n\r\nMozart''s most famous string piece is Eine Kleine Nachtmuzik -- A Little Night Music.  I asked myself, What about music for the next morning?  What would that be?  Eine Kleine Frühstück Muzik? -- A Little Breakfast Music?  What instruments and what tunes would express that?\r\n\r\nI thought about what I like to eat for breakfast and asked myself how these items could be depicted.  \r\n\r\nWhat about orange juice?  \r\n\r\nWe don''t drink much O.J.; just a little glass, please; the movement must be short.  Duration: 1:42.\r\n\r\nOrange juice is a pick-me-up, an eye-opener; the tune must be a bugle-call, a RISING tune; it must say, "Wake up!"\r\n\r\nOrange juice is brightly colored; the piece must be in a sharp key, played by treble  instruments, no lumbering basses, cellos or bassoons; I scored it for oboe, clarinet and two violins.  \r\n\r\nIt must be a bit sour, a bit dissonant, but pleasing, the way orange juice is.\r\n\r\nIt must sound like morning; it must have that fresh, sunny, American sound we hear in Copland''s best-loved pieces.\r\n\r\nTo hear Orange Juice, the opening movement of "A Little Breakfast Music," played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook (recorded on my CD "A Portrait at 50"), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nDecember, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI am, to the bone, an Ohioan.  And an amateur Ohio-ologist.\r\n\r\nAwhile back, in one of my Sunday morning emails, I began with this:\r\n\r\n“When a presidential candidate said, “Ohio is an amazing state!” I thought:  “The claims are true; this candidate really is a liar.  I know a thing or two about the Buckeye state and the only thing here that amazes me is Serpent Mound.”\r\n\r\nA friend and fan who enjoys these emails replied to remind me of Ohio’s great public library system, asserting:  “Ohio is the only state that supports local libraries and thus any Ohioan can patronize any local public library.”  She is right.  Ohio’s public library system is amazing; Cincinnati’s has the highest circulation rate in North America; I live just six blocks from the Main Library, an amazing resource.  When I became friends with the former children’s book editor of the NY Times, she told me, “Ohio’s public library system is the envy of the nation."\r\n\r\nAnother wrote, “Ohio cannot be Hawaii.  ‘Amazing'' can take various forms.  Wendell Berry wrote an essay in which he cautions against the emphasis on ''showpiece'' parks and natural sites, addressing the danger of overlooking the humble beauty around us, when we only preserve places that are so obviously glorious."\r\n\r\nWell said and true enough.  Wendell Berry is what the Japanese call “a living national treasure.”  Who am I to gainsay a great soul?\r\n\r\nStill, the candidate was lying.  The pronouncement that ”Ohio is amazing” was not about humble beauty, public libraries or Serpent Mound.  It was pandering.\r\n\r\nThe reasons I differ with the candidate’s assertion don’t arise from a comparison of Ohio’s scenery with that of other states.  Nor am I forgetting the truly amazing achievements of certain Ohioans, such as Wilbur and Orville Wright.  \r\n\r\nI am thinking chiefly of Ohio’s attitude toward new ideas.\r\n\r\nTake for example, the idea of raising of the minimum wage in Ohio so that service industry workers could earn an income just above the poverty level.  This issue speaks to me.  Last Fall I left my part-time position as an ‘art guard'' at the Cincinnati Art Museum.  Eight years earlier, I began at the minimum wage.  By the time I left, incremental raises had lifted my pay to $8.25 per hour.  \r\n\r\nFor me, working as a museum guard was a gentleman’s pastime.  But some of my fellow guards were trying to earn a living from that job alone.  Ironic, that “the working poor” should be engaged to protect paintings, sculptures and objets d’art worth billions.\r\n\r\nYou must have heard:  some cities and states have raised the minimum wage to $15.   Ohio would never be the first to experiment with anything so ‘amazing’ as that.  Our governor, despite commendably articulating a Christian concern for the poor (sparking immediate criticism from his fellow party members), strongly opposes raising the minimum wage, as does the majority party in both houses of our legislature.  They say it would be ''bad for business.’  \r\n\r\nHow about a penny tax on bottles of sugar-sweetened beverages?  Fine for folks in Berkley, California if that’s how they want to try to reduce the rate of obesity.  (Psst!  It’s working.)\r\n\r\nA nickel deposit on glass bottles?  \r\n\r\nHigh speed rail connecting Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland?  \r\n\r\nA Johnny Appleseed National Monument?\r\n\r\nRoadways paved with solar cells?\r\n\r\nThe town of Fitzgerald, GA planted pecan trees in every yard.  After a few years, instead of paying a city tax, the citizens simply gathered the pecans and turned them over to the city, which sold them to pecan buyers, thus funding the city government.  The residents of Fitzgerald paid zero city taxes.  Pecan trees won''t thrive in Ohio’s climate, true.  So … walnut trees?   Good idea?  I don’t know.  Just sayin’ ...\r\n\r\nSome cities plant hardwood ‘shade trees’ along the streets.  How about planting apple trees, providing free apples to anyone who wants to pluck them from the branches or gather them up from the ground?   Good idea?  I don’t suppose Ohio’s apple orchard industry would think so.  Understandable.\r\n\r\nNot all new ideas are good ideas.  Still, can we be open to new ideas?  How about considering twenty new ideas and then choosing the best one?\r\n\r\nOh, me-oh-my-oh.  Not in Ohio.\r\n\r\nOhio is wary of new-fangled notions.  ’Twas ever thus.  Mark Twain observed, “If the world should come to an end, I’d want to be in Cincinnati because everything happens there ten years after it happens everywhere else.”\r\n\r\nOnly when about two-thirds of the other states have succeeded in doing something new, only then will Ohio begin to consider it.  Buckeyes have an unwritten policy opposing anything that might just maybe seem edgy to somebody somewhere, no matter how enthusiastically others might favor it.  \r\n\r\nEven when we do achieve something great, it’s in the face of fervid opposition.  Last week Cincinnati  inaugurated its new 3.6 mile electric streetcar system, connecting two parts of the historic downtown.  The proposal was passionately decried and fiercely opposed, from the start.  The citizenry launched multiple petition drives against it.  Our current mayor proudly campaigned as the proposals''s most vociferous opponent.  Our current governor’s transportation panel stripped $52 million of federal funds which had been made available for the project and which would have extended the streetcar’s route so as to connect the downtown to the University district.  The governor takes a dim view of public transit.  \r\n\r\nCincinnati’s new streetcar squeaked into existence by the skin of its teeth, within hours of a deadline to qualify for the remaining federal funds.  \r\n\r\nYet other cities such as Portland, San Francisco and New Orleans, have long been famous for their streetcars.  (Note that all three are coastal cities.)  \r\n\r\nStreetcars are not a new idea, not even here.  Cincinnati had an electric streetcar system for 62 years (1889-1951) without collapsing into fiscal or cultural chaos.  And this new one is so modest.  Just 3.6 miles.  In 2002, a 60-mile system was proposed that would have connected nearly all of the city’s 52 neighborhoods, costing a mere half-cent hike in the local sales tax.  Cincinnati voted it down, with a whopping 68% opposed.  Why would such an obviously good idea face such an uphill struggle for acceptance here in Middle-America, here in Ohio?\r\n\r\nWhen I was a county commissioner in northern Ohio I strongly supported the conversion of an unused railroad track into a bike trail that would connect the municipalities of Bellville, Lexington and Mansfield.  The opposition was immediate and furious.  At public hearings, people whose sons had been in my Scout troop, screamed in my face.  A bike trail, they said, would bring trespassers, drugs, burglary and rape. Cyclists would poop on their lawns; property values would plummet.  Plus, paradoxically, they were certain that NO-body would EVER use it.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of a vicious campaign against it, which included heavy-handed vandalism, like bulldozing piles of dirt over the proposed path, it passed by a hair.  Mind, this was WELL AFTER rail-to-trail bike paths had popped up all over the country.  Today, thirty years later, back in Mansfield, everyone loves ‘the bike trail’ and hundreds use it every day.\r\n\r\nThese stories are typical of Ohio.  We say, “What?  Be an innovator?  Foster an “amazing” new idea?  No thank you.  Let the coasts innovate, if it suits their fancy.  We know who we are and where we are:  we’re in the middle, the center.  Maybe, just maybe, after a long time, after a great many others have done it, then Ohio might — mind you, might — think about giving it a try.”\r\n\r\nWhy does Ohio have this attitude?  It began when Ohio was the Wild West.  Ohio''s pioneers were a confluence of two disparate cultures:  Connecticut Yankees and Virginians.  The New Englanders viewed the Virginians as shiftless and lazy.  The Virginians viewed the Yankees as grasping and Puritanical.  But the hardships of the frontier forced them to look past their prejudices and get along.  They managed it and in the process they devised a new kind of American:  the Midwesterner.  \r\n\r\nNeither New England-ish nor Southern, Ohio remains determinedly centrist to this day. Midwesterners are famously friendly, but wary of new ideas. \r\n\r\nPolitically, this makes Ohio the preeminent ''battleground state.''  Oddly enough, precisely because Ohio is the most typical, ordinary, middle-of-the-road, centrist state, Ohioans, though they constitute only about 3% of the total population of this country, usually decide who will be president.  That’s sort of amazing, I have to admit.\r\n\r\nWe split very nearly 50/50 on every candidate, every issue, every idea.  We balance urban and rural, 50/50.  With more cities boasting populations in excess of 50,000 than any other state, we retain a rural character; Ohio is thought of as a ''farm state.’   When Ohio tilts a tidge to the Right or a smidgeon to the Left, so goes the Nation.  \r\n\r\nPlease don’t get me wrong.  Ohio suits me just fine.  As a speaker-for-hire, a presenter in schools, a writer and publisher of books about the state, and, yes, as a composer, I’ve had thousands of opportunities right here in Ohio.  I’d not be churlish.  I’m grateful and I’ve expressed my gratitude in various small ways, by trying to make my state a better place.\r\n\r\nI see my life’s work, which you kindly allow me to share in these emails, as a completely characteristic product of Ohio.  The music I’ve composed -- every note, phrase and chord  — is, for better or worse, Ohio-ish.  It offers nothing innovative or experimental, nothing “amazing."  It simply extends existing musical traditions in pleasant, comfortable, respectful ways.  \r\n\r\nI was never an avant garde composer, never wanted to be.  Call me a composer of the “derrièrre garde.”  Call me an Ohioan.\r\n\r\nMine is the music you would expect to have been composed by a middle-class guy who grew up in the 1950’s, in Mansfield, Ohio, a rural county seat, a town, not quite a city.   A Boy Scout who earned his Eagle badge (fifty years ago this month) and later served as a Scoutmaster.  Married to my high school sweetheart for 44 years, I’ve been a faithful husband, a loving father and a law-abiding citizen.  I have voted in every election, served on a jury and even held public office for a single term.  I eschew vulgarity and deplore profanity.  I’m an every-Sunday church-goer at a Presbyterian church where I am a Deacon and a tenor in the choir.  I organize and chair the church’s annual Shrove Tuesday Pancake Supper.  In short, I’m reliable, a fellow who keeps his word and pays his bills on time.\r\n\r\nMy music is well-crafted, occasionally funny, sometimes moving.  No one is amazed by it.  \r\n\r\nAmazing?  Debussy’s “La Mer,” Sibelius’ Fifth Symphony, Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,” Charles Ives’ “The Unanswered Question,” George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” …  those works amaze.\r\n\r\nMe?  I’ve turned out good, solid, Ohio stuff.  I’ve made people smile.\r\n\r\nAin’t nothin’ wrong with that!\r\n\r\nHere’s an example.  I’m inviting you to listen to "Eggs & Bacon,” the third movement from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz, clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook.  (Note the obvious:  eggs and bacon do not amaze, but they sure are good!)  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSeptember 18, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\nChina!   Tea.  Rice.  Right?  You’d think so, but … well ...\r\n\r\nMore precisely, Taiwan!  The furthest away from home I’d ever been.  \r\n\r\nI shepherded three cultural exchange tour groups from Richland County, Ohio, my native stomping grounds, to Taiwan and back. I had gotten myself elected County Commissioner in 1986.  Our county had a sister-county relationship with Taipei, Taiwan.  The other commissioners, one a mid-level United Telephone executive, the other a Dairy farmer, had no interest in our relationship with the Republic of China.  So it fell to me.  I made the most of it.  \r\n\r\nAfter Nixon’s 1972 visit to mainland China, the USA severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  To this day we have no embassy there, though Taiwan remains our fifth-largest trading partner.  \r\n\r\nThus, I, of all people, a composer who had stumbled into politics, found myself the highest-ranking American office-holder to visit the island in the seventeen years since Nixon had reversed our China policy.  I got the red carpet treatment.  The Governor of Taiwan greeted me in his office.  I even met Lee Teng-hui, the President of the Republic of China, marking the only time I ever chewed the fat with a seated Head of State.  \r\n\r\nThey didn’t seem to realize that a County Commissioner has no sway in the formulation of international policy.  Maybe they knew but were too polite to let on.  Maybe they thought my political star was rising and that I might someday become an American Grand Pooh Bah.  If so, they were mistaken.  I served only one term and never ran for office again.  (Aside from visits to Taiwan, my tenure as a County Commissioner wasn’t much fun.)\r\n\r\nChinese don’t shake hands.  They bow and serve tea.  A dozen times a day, promenaded in parks, museums, schools, universities, governmental agencies, I was presented with  tiny cups of delicious tea, piping hot.  I drank it politely, toasting my host — the director, principal or bureaucrat-in-chief, as the case may be -- as he toasted me.  \r\nBut when I wanted a cup of tea in a restaurant I could never get one.  Instead, my hosts insisted that I drink fine wine during the meal and cognac afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with rice.  The food was fabulous, vivid, piquant, colorful, imaginative, brilliant.  Beyond describing.  Each of the multiple courses was so flavorful that it begged for the palliative contrast of a nice pile of delicious, steaming rice alongside.  Yet, rice was not to be had.\r\n\r\nI could not understand this.  What is Chinese cuisine, anyway?  Great Stuff + Rice.  That’s the equation.  Right?  Everyone knows that.  But all I got was the Great Stuff.  Never a grain of rice.\r\n\r\nFinally, I pressed the issue, just a little.  I politely insisted.  I figured it would be easy.  We were in a Chinese restaurant, for Pete’s sake, so they just HAD to have a pot of rice on the stove, back in the kitchen.  All they had to do was bring me a bowl of it.\r\n\r\nWhen my interpreter explained my request to the waiter, the fellow gave me a quick, odd look, then smiled, nodded and left.  I thought he’d be back in a jiffy with my rice but when he returned a few minutes later he was rice-less.\r\n\r\nThe meal went on for a very long time, with numerous toasts and pledges of undying friendship.  When I asked my interpreter about the rice, she whispered, “It’s coming.”  \r\n\r\nFinally the orange slices were served, the final item in a traditional Chinese feast.  Then my hosts got up, accepted my thanks, bowed, bade me goodnight and departed.  \r\n\r\nA little cross-eyed from the cognac, I staggered to the restroom.  When I returned, there, standing beside our empty table, next to my interpreter, was the waiter, holding a large bowl of rice.\r\n\r\n“But, but, but …” I stammered.  "I’m terribly sorry, but I don’t want it now.  And I can’t take it with me.  What would I do with it?”  The interpreter translated, the waiter smiled, made a brief, pleasant remark and took his leave, rice bowl and all.  Clearly, my refusal of the rice was no big deal.\r\n\r\nOut on the sidewalk, I asked my interpreter to explain what the heck was going on.\r\n\r\n“First,” she said, “it took a long time because they probably had to send someone to a grocery to buy the rice, bring it back and cook it.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.  You see, a restaurant of that quality would never have rice on the menu.  It’s the lowest form of food and no good restaurant offers it.”\r\n\r\n“But Chinese people love rice, right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and we eat it every day.  But an honored guest like yourself would never, never be served rice unless your hosts were so extremely poor that rice was absolutely the only food they had to offer.”\r\n\r\nI was amazed.  She explained a little more, saying, “In America, you often eat breakfast cereal, correct?  But if you gave a dinner party for an honored guest who had come 13,000 miles to visit you, would you serve breakfast cereal?   Even with your own family and friends, is breakfast cereal your Holiday Feast?  No.  It would be an insult to serve an item so humble, unless you had nothing else on your shelf.”\r\n\r\nI began to understand.  “Why did the waiter bring the bowl at all?”\r\n\r\n“Because you asked for it.  You’re the honored guest and if you ask for something, you’re going to get it, whatever it is.  But you notice that the waiter did not appear with the rice until everyone else had departed.  He did not want the others to see him bringing you a bowl of rice.”\r\n\r\nIt was a valuable lesson.  Tea is not just hot liquid and rice is not just belly-timber.  Taiwan is a long way from Ohio.  The world is wide.  Food isn’t just provender.  It connotes, signifies, symbolizes.  Different foods mean different things in different lands.  \r\n\r\nThink about that as you listen to my little theme-and-variations, entitled "A Variety of Herb Teas,” the final movement from A Little Breakfast Music, played by oboist Robert Franz, clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook.  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 19, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	Excogitate?  Why not!\r\n\r\n	Let''s excogitate the monetary value assigned to a painting.\r\n\r\n	Young marrieds, we purchased is a delicate still life in oils.  It depicts a basket of eggs on a wooden table, a shadow-crossed wall in the background.  It is hushed, in a minor key, quietly monumental.\r\n\r\n	It was painted by Mike Wasemann, an artist of my generation and from  my hometown, Mansfield, Ohio,.  We eventually acquired four more Wasemanns.  We cherish them to this day.  A superb painter, Mike remained unknown and died young, I’m sorry to say.\r\n\r\n	We hung our first ''art purchase'' in the tiny dining room of our first home, ‘the Little Yellow House,“ as we called it, on Fitting Avenue in Bellville, Ohio, Jo’s hometown, ten miles south of Mansfield..  \r\n\r\n	A day or two later, Jo’s Grandpa Divelbiss, a retired mechanical engineer who lived down the street, stopped by.  We eagerly led him to the dining room and showed him our painting.\r\n\r\n	He stared at it for a good while.  The glisten of the basket’s reeds, interwoven and varnished, is delicately rendered;  the depiction of the wall behind the basket, bisected by a dramatic shadow, recalls the delicately textured walls of Vermeer’s interiors;  the ovoid shapes of the eggs are revealed with exquisite, intricate shadings.  Clearly, this artist looked long, hard and lovingly at his subject.\r\n\r\n	Now Grandpa Divelbiss looked long and hard.  We waited to hear what he would say.\r\n\r\n	At length, he turned to us.  “How much did you pay for this?”  \r\n\r\n	We told him.  $65.\r\n\r\n	He directed his gaze back to the painting.  \r\n\r\n	“Mphm!" he asservated.  “If you want to look at eggs you can buy a dozen of ‘em for a dollar and when you’re done lookin’ at ‘em you can eat ‘em!”\r\n\r\n	Now let’s excogitate the monetary value assigned to music.\r\n\r\n	Music itself is always free.  What we purchase is access to it.  Sheet music requires engraving or computer notation, paper, ink, printing, envelope, postage.  A recording requires paying for the musicians, the engineer, the studio, the graphic artist who designs the cover, the pressing factory, the envelope, the postage.  To enter a concert hall, we pay an admission fee.  But the music itself remains free.\r\n\r\n	So too, musical ideas come to a composer for free.  I never paid a nickel for an inspiration.  They’re not for sale.\r\n\r\n	How much money, then, ought I to have charged for the hard copy sheet music of my scores or the CDs on which my music was recorded?  I felt a little knavish, assigning fees to my creations.  What a relief to use the internet to share free PDFs and mp3s of my work.\r\n\r\n	How would Grandpa Divelbiss excogitate the matter?  He was right about the painting, obviously, if all you want to do is look at eggs and then eat ‘em.  He’d probably say, “If you want hear music, turn on the radio."\r\n\r\n	And a piece of music about eggs?  I actually wrote one, the “Eggs & Bacon” movement from my suite, ‘A Little Breakfast Music’ for two violins, oboe and clarinet.  \r\n\r\n	I can imagine:  "Mphm!  If you want to listen to eggs fryin’, you can buy a dozen of ‘em for a dollar and plop ‘em in a fryin’ pan.  And when you git tired of listenin’ to ‘em sizzle, you can eat ‘em!”\r\n\r\n	A practical man!  An engineer!  \r\n\r\n	For Grandpa Divelbiss, for better or worse, everything was plain and simple.\r\n\r\n	To hear "Eggs & Bacon,” the third movement from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz, clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	This morning, French Toast is on the menu.  \r\n\r\n	That''s the name of the second movement of my suite, "A Little Breakfast Music."  I wrote this music in 1976 for two couples, an oboist-violinist pair and a clarinetist-violinist pair.  I wanted to give them some music that the four of them could play together; there is no repertoire for that combination of instruments.  The absence of a bass instrument and the subject of breakfast called for a light, supple music:  sprightly, nimble, delightful.\r\n\r\n	For me, at 26, the piece was a ‘grand gesture,’ a fancied snub of the avant garde and of the high seriousness of the academic musical establishment.  Not that the avant garde or the academic establishment was following what an obscure composer in Bellville, Ohio wrote in his spare time.  Still, for me, the piece was a milestone, confirming, at least for myself, my commitment to write memorable melodies with attractive tonal harmonies.\r\n\r\n	Too, I wanted to eschew the grandiose.  I wanted to celebrate the beauty in things humble and near to hand.  \r\n\r\n	Thus, French toast:  golden, fragrant, agleam with maple syrup.  What is more beautiful?\r\n\r\n	I know very well that French Toast is not particularly French.    The Frenchies like it well enough, terming it "pain perdu,” meaning “lost bread”, i.e. “stale.”   But it’s not particularly associated with French cuisine.  It’s merely a practical use for stale bread. \r\n\r\n	Still, including a movement about French Toast in my “Breakfast Music” gave me an excuse to write music that would sound Franco-American, influenced not by the great Debussy and Ravel but rather by their charming kid brothers, the French composers of the next generation:  Ibert, Milhaud, Poulenc and Francaix.  I like those guys.  They found ways to extend the French musical traditions they’d inherited.  They influenced many American composers.  Gershwin, Copland and Virgil Thomson took some cues from them.\r\n\r\n	Unlike George, Aaron and Virgil, I have a genetic connection to France.  I am of French descent.  (See photo in the postscript below)  The Sauvage family thrived in France from time immemorial.  Then they turned Protestant.  My Huguenot ancestors fled the religious persecution to which Louis XIV turned a blind eye, curse his bones.  (Were it not for the Sun King’s bigotry, I’d be a Frenchman.)  After a hundred years in Holland and then London, my branch of the Sauvage line left Europe forever, arriving in Boston in 1737.  A hundred years later they had moved to Pennsylvania changing the name to “Sowash” to accommodate their German-speaking neighbors.\r\n\r\n	I like to fancy that in my heart I’m still French.   Such a conceit is what French people term “une folie,” an extravagant yet affable show of madness!  Ha, ha.  Who cares?  It’s fun to embrace and extend a heritage of your own choosing.  Three of my four grandparents were of German extraction, so I could have chosen otherwise.  “it’s a free country,” as folks still say.  I freely made my choice.  Musically and otherwise, I decided to be Franco-American!\r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement, "French Toast," from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nP.S.  The voyageurs’ cap and arrowed belt are symbols of Québécois identity.  I’m not French Canadian but, in colder weather, I don these clothing items to announce that I am a North American man of French descent.  (The dogs are not impressed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nSmiles and laughter being precious commodities in dark times, let’s raise a glass of orange juice together -- a toast to celebrate my 71st birthday.\r\n\r\nWhich was yesterday.  This is “the morning after.”  No hangover for me, be assured.  I cherish my apricot brandy on a cold winter’s evening but I live by the ancient admonition:  Moderation in all things.\r\n\r\nCaution made minimal my birthday celebration:  a few cards and phone calls from our two children were the extent of it.\r\n\r\nLike millions, I’m eager to get the vaccine and to escape this joyless Spartan lifestyle the virus has forced upon us.  But no one seems to know where or how I can sign up for the injection.\r\n\r\nI figure I could qualify as at least one of the following ...\r\n\r\n	1) a septuagenarian\r\n	2) a teacher (albeit on sabbatical)\r\n	3) a Living National Treasure\r\n\r\nBut even we in the L.N.T. community don’t know when or where we’re supposed to go to get the shot.  Lacking guidance, we’ve taken to asking one another.  \r\n\r\nMerle called me the other day.  I could only tell her, “How should I know?”  \r\n\r\nYo-yo called too, late yesterday afternoon.  When I saw his name on Caller ID, I let the phone answering machine handle it.  He’s a sweetheart but he does go on and on — yack, yack, yack — and I had to get started on supper.  I’ll call him back this afternoon after I’ve finished milking the elk.\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nLet’s return to the orange juice.  You can join me in a toast, figuratively, by listening to the “Orange Juice” movement from my suite titled “A Little Breakfast Music.”\r\n\r\nToo much orange juice is not a good thing.  “Just a small glass, please,” we say.  My ‘O.J.’ music is brief.  Duration: 1:42.\r\n\r\nOrange juice is a pick-me-up, an eye-opener.  Thus, the tune had to be a bugle-call, a RISING tune, a tune that says, "Wake up!"\r\n\r\nOrange juice is brightly colored;  thus, the piece is scored only for treble-clef instruments:  oboe, clarinet and two violins.   No dark basses, cellos or bassoons.  \r\n\r\nThe music, like the juice, must be a bit sour, a bit dissonant, yet pleasing.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it must sound like morning -- that fresh, sunny, American sound we hear in Copland''s best-loved pieces.\r\n\r\nTo hear Orange Juice, the opening movement of "A Little Breakfast Music," played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook (recorded on my CD "A Portrait at 50"), click on the link above.. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),57);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(37,replace(replace('Odell Shepard’s The Harvest of a Quiet Eye is a tapestry of essays and poems recounting a walking journey the author made through rural Connecticut in September of 1926.  An engaging minor classic of the literature of walking, the book brims with good, sweet things:  a deep affection for small towns and little rivers, an appreciation of solitude alternating with vivid character sketches and an abundance of gently humorous, pleasantly self-indulgent digressions into many other subjects.  The book is imbued with optimism and serenity.  \r\n\r\nIt''s a book I love and have read many, many times.  For years, I''ve purchased first editions of the book to give to friends.  The first edition is beautiful, printed in dark green ink on rich, creamy vellum and with broad margins.  Over a hundred illustrations.  The book even smells good!  No one is producing books like that, nowadays.\r\n\r\nShepard wrote in a way that suggests an alternative 20th century, the quiet, pastoral 20th century that might have been had we been able to dodge two world wars, the Great Depression, Cold War tensions, the strains of prolonged nuclear threat, overpopulation and the ravaging of the environment.  Shepard kept his art clean of angst and alienation. He walked and wrote in an America as refreshingly remote from our own as Oz or Middle Earth.\r\n\r\nYet he is no fantasist; he roots his appreciation for the beauty of life in a full acceptance of its transience.  \r\n \r\nWho was he?  Odell Shepard (1884-1967) was a professor of English literature at Trinity College, a newspaper columnist, a pianist and singer, an indefatigable walker and trout fisherman, and even, for one term, lieutenant governor of Connecticut!  Shepard wrote well on an astonishingly diverse array of topics and in nearly every literary form.  His biography of Bronson Alcott won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize.  His novels Jenkins’ Ear, and Holdfast Gaines, co-authored with his son, were successful Book-of-the-Month Club selection.  Books on Connecticut history, Shakespeare, and trout-fishing as well as essays, poems, newspaper columns and editings of other writers whose work he admired poured from his pen in the 1920’s and ‘30’s.  Two of his books, The Heart of Thoreau''s Journals and his masterful study of the unicorn myth, The Lore of the Unicorn, have never gone out of print.\r\n\r\nRhapsodizing in prose, his writing is strikingly good, quietly dignified yet impassioned, a noble, flowing, musical prose that aspires to poetry.  If this was music, we''d describe it as tonal and melodic.	\r\n\r\nI''ve set to music several of his poems and in 2010 I wrote my only extended dramatic work, adapting Shepard''s account, in The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, of his encounter with a grim marsh-land, "livid with Death."  He dares to try to hear what the Marsh is "saying" to him; she asserts Nature''s indifference to our brief human experiment with consciousness.  It nearly undoes him. A message like that, if we really take it in, can just about undo any of us.  \r\n\r\nThen, rejoicing in the beauty of the dying leaves of autumn, he affirms Life all the more heartily and strides "with high-hearted singing" to the end of his day''s hike, crossing the bridge and seeing the light of his inn "at the far end shining."  I take the bridge as a metaphor for our journeys’ end in Death and the inn, with its shining lights, as a metaphor of a welcoming, restful afterlife.\r\n\r\nMy cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye is in twelve-movements, scored for baritone (who sings the role of Shepard, the hiker-narrator), soprano (who sings the words of the Marsh-land), chorus (who comments on the action), four-part chorus and a miniature orchestra consisting of a flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nJust now I want to share the last two movements:  the baritone solo in which Shepard so beautifully comes to terms with Death, followed by the Finale for baritone, chorus and instruments when he finishes his hike, crossing the bridge at last.\r\n\r\nHere are the words:\r\n\r\nMovement #11:  It is true that I am walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death and that soon I shall lie down there, never to rise, and that every flower and face and thought that I have known, together with all that my fellows have thought and dreamed and made, will lie there very soon beside me.  But yet it is a most beautiful valley and I have always loved it and I love it more deeply at every step that brings me nearer the end. Why then should I grieve to lie here forever?  The oak and the maple are dying too and they comfort me.  For they do not dwindle and pine into the grave but go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas as though they have some expectation of joy, some intuition that from this dying world unimaginable life may spring as the new year springs from the ruins of the old.  In such company at least I can say that I will fear no evil.\r\n\r\nMovement #12:  The sun was setting behind the mountains and a breeze awoke in the sky.  The new moon was blown bare of clouds and the stars shown round her like a shining wreath.  By her pale illumination I found my way.  I strode along with high-hearted singing until at last I could see the bridge and finally the light of my inn at the far end shining.\r\n\r\nThat ending touches my heart; when I hear this music my throat tightens, tears come.  I want to raise a hand and wave goodbye to this good man as he crosses over.  I may ask my choir director friend, Chris Miller, to sing and lead these two movements at my funeral.\r\n\r\nTo hear the last two movements of The Harvest Quiet Eye, in the premiere performance by the superb baritone Noel Bouley with the Cincinnati Camerata under the direction of Chris Miller, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 12, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“The Harvest of a Quiet Eye” is the name of one of my favorite books and also the name of my only extended work for soloists and chorus.  The author of this book, Odell Shepard, borrowed the title from a poem by Wordsworth:\r\n\r\nThe outward shows of sky and earth,\r\nOf hill and valley he has viewed;\r\nAnd impulses of deeper birth \r\nHave come to him in solitude.\r\n\r\nIn common things that round us lie\r\nSome random truths he can impart, --\r\nThe harvest of a quiet eye \r\nThat broods and sleeps on his own heart.\r\n\r\nMy cantata opens with a choral setting of those noble words.  What follows are settings of Shepard''s account of his encounter with a grim Marsh-land, "livid with Death."  He dares to try to hear what the Marsh is "saying" to him; she asserts Nature''s indifference to our brief human experiment and it nearly undoes him.  A message like that, if we really take it in, leads to despair.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, surprised, he finds himself remembering the “brave, high-hearted songs” his fellow human beings have sung and he rejoices in that memory and in the beauty of the dying autumn leaves that “go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas."  He affirms our  human adventure all the more heartily and strides through what remains of his day’s hike (and, we feel, through what will remain of his life), "with high-hearted singing."\r\n\r\nToday I''ll share just the two-minute opening movement.  I think this sounds like an opening, a beginning.  From the git-go, it''s expansive.  Something is astir.  Good things lie ahead.  It’s like the opening credits of a well-scored film.\r\n\r\nThe work is in twelve movements, scored for baritone (singing the role of Shepard, the hiker-narrator), soprano (the haunting voice of the Marsh-land), chorus (commenting on the action) and a miniature orchestra:  flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nTo hear the opening movement of The Harvest Quiet Eye, in the premiere performance by the Cincinnati Camerata under the direction of Chris Miller, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 22, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\nHappy Easter.  Speaking of which … \r\n\r\n	<< The God many Christians worship is far too small.  God is not a “tribal” God, somewhere “out there,” belonging only to Judaism or Christianity.  It’s no wonder so many educated, postmodern people have given up on such a God … not nearly as big as science is discovering the universe itself to be. >>   \r\n											— Richard Rohr\r\n\r\nFor many, the reported bigness of the universe staggers Faith.  Belief is rattled, too, by what we’re told of the History of the universe and its bleak, inexorable future.\r\n\r\nWe ‘educated, postmodern people’ are not the first to find that such discoveries are at odds with Religion.  Even before Galileo there must always have been a long list of seemingly solid reasons to reject the sacredness of materiality, to remain willfully blind to the implications of consciousness, to resist the tempting notion of God.\r\n\r\nMy only extended dramatic vocal work, my cantata, “The Harvest of a Quiet Eye,” is a setting of excerpts from the book of that title by Odell Shepard; it addresses, in a drama, the issue that Rohr raises in an essay. \r\n\r\nIn the book, as in the cantata, the story is told of a solitary walker who encounters a marsh and dares to face what he perceives to be its grim message:  that all Life dies, that this unutterably vast universe is devoid of meaning, that these assertions obviate and render empty the notion of God.  The story does not stop there; surprisingly, it leads to a resurrection of Faith and ends in triumphant serenity.\r\n\r\nSometimes I find that “the world is charged with the Grandeur of God.”  Other times the notion of God seems absurd and sentimental.  I have good friends who cannot grasp why I show up, every Sunday, at a church service.  Their notion of God is, I think, narrow.  That’s why it seems ridiculous to them.  I agree.  A narrow notion of God IS ridiculous.  As with the Christians Rohr references, many an ardent atheist clings to a concept of God that "is far too small.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I find myself bewildered, I try to remember to do what the solitary walker does in response to the grim assertions of the Marsh.   I think about Consciousness, our human consciousness, unique, incredible, mysterious and inexplicable … no one knows what it is nor how it came to be … let alone, even more importantly, WHY it came to be.  Who among us can answer that question?  \r\n\r\nWhen I ponder such questions I find myself traipsing into the realms of Theology.  And there I find solace and certitude.  The absurdly narrow idea of the tribal God of the Abrahamic Religions, that ''Big Man with the Long White Beard Who’s Got His Finger In Every Pie,'' shrivels away.  I am left filled with wonder, awe and humility.  At such moments I have a yearning to worship. \r\n\r\nTo be sure, such moments do not always coincide with my attendance at the weekly 11 a.m. Sunday morning services at Cincinnati''s Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church, my church, our church.  But church attendance keeps me in touch with the notion of God and puts me into the company of friends who share my curiosity about such things.\r\n\r\nThe solitary walker in The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, after taking on board what the Marsh has to tell, remembers "our habitable little globe and the fires we have kindled, building them on the edges of the abyss and lighting only our own faces against the ring of darkness, but still ... fires.”\r\n\r\nHe recalls "the brave high-hearted songs we sing as though the dark were not, the songs that tally all our faiths, our hopes, our dreams, the brave high-hearted songs we’ve made to sing us through the dark, the songs that tally all our faiths, our joys and lamentations, our yearnings, our illusions and our heroic hopes."\r\n\r\nFinally, this leads him to rejoice in the astonishing fact of our human consciousness.  \r\n\r\nThe climactic tenth movement of the cantata is the four-part choral fugue I made, setting to music, as passionately as I could, the noble words he gives us at that moment:  \r\n\r\n	"It may be that Nature did not foresee us, but in all her kingdoms she has brought forth no other such pathetic and marvelous thing as this human heart, so trivial and heroic, so dauntless though so filled with fears, that can smile into the eyes of Death.”\r\n\r\nResurrection!\r\n\r\nTo hear my fugue, “It May Be That Nature,” the tenth movement of my cantata The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, from the 12/3/16 performance by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus, with Edward Elwyn Jones conducting, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 16, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!”\r\n\r\nThat’s what Ophelia says about Hamlet.  That’s what I fear you might say about me when you hear the piece of music I am going to share today, if you’ll permit me.\r\n\r\nIt’s the “Song of the Marsh” from my cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, my only extended dramatic vocal work, a setting of excerpts from the book of that title by Odell Shepard.\r\n\r\nIn the book, as in the cantata, the story is told of a solitary walker who encounters a marsh and dares to hear its grim message:  that this unutterably vast universe is devoid of meaning.  The story does not stop there; surprisingly, it leads to a resurrection of faith, celebrating consciousness and ending in triumphant serenity.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, on Easter Sunday, I shared the triumphant music that follows in response to the "Song of the Marsh."  Some of you kindly asked to hear the song itself.  Today you will.\r\n\r\nMost of my music is tame, conservative, pastoral sometimes funny.  Music like that would not do justice to the powerful darkness of the monologue Shepard devised for the marsh.\r\n\r\nRead the words and imagine how YOU might set them to music ...\r\n\r\n	"Soft and dreamy seeker of pleasant emotions, you see no farther into reality than a painted butterfly flapping from flower to flower.  You too are convinced that the sun shines to warm your wings, that the meadows are strewn with flowers to flatter your delight in color.\r\n\r\n	"Stare into my vacant eyes, older than thought, older than mind-stuff, and learn more than e’er you have in pondering the wisest of books. Your poets have not told you such things as I tell, for I remember the dinosaur’s wallowing and the scream of the saber-tooth. \r\n\r\n	 "Peer down into the savageries of the under-sea. Think your way out into the infinity of the sky or down into the answering infinity of the atom. \r\n\r\n	"Stand and look at me. As I am now, so was the planet for innumerable ages before you came and so it will be for endless ages after you are gone. \r\n\r\n	"Now you may pass, for I think you will not forget."\r\n\r\nChilling sentiments, they warrant music that is beautiful but harsh, and a performance that is deeply felt but anti-sentimental.  The soprano in this performance is Jacquelyn Stucker and she is marvelous!  Her dusky lower register is perfect for the opening and closing of the song;  her higher register blossoms gorgeously when the music conveys the flower-strewn meadows and our delight in color.  She thunders like heaven’s artillery when she sings of the dinosaur’s wallowing and the scream of the saber-tooth.\r\n\r\n(Ms. Stucker told me, “This is the first time in my career that I’ve sung the word ’saber-tooth.’”  We both smiled and I said, “Well, you never know what you might be gettin’ yourself into.”)\r\n\r\nShe was featured in the 12/3/16 performance by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus under Edward Elwyn Jones, conductor, in the Sanders Theatre on the campus of Harvard University.  I’m very happy that I was able to attend the concert; it was one of the most meaningful events of my life.\r\n\r\nThis “Song of the Marsh” is, musically, far beyond the limits of my usual conservative style.  It may approach the music we might imagine Debussy to have composed, had he lived another twenty or thirty years.  \r\n\r\nIt may not be to your liking.  The music is not intended to be likable in the usual sense.  Hearing it, you may find yourself echoing Ophelia’s quip about the melancholy Dane. \r\n\r\nI hope you’ll see why I wrote it the way I did.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it a try, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 21, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nW.B. Yeats dispraised the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay, saying it was “all hot lobster and mountain tops.”\r\n\r\nFunny, but perhaps better left unsaid.  Poets are well advised, I think, to keep their opinions of other poets to themselves.  The same goes for composers and all arts practitioners.  Who rejoices in a sour snipe?  No good comes of it.  What does the faultfinder gain?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, religion and politics make unsuitable grist for the conversational mills in the workplace.  One time when i was chatting with a fellow security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, the subject of Cincinnati’s hungry school children came up.  The guard with whom I was speaking was a jolly fellow.  Chubby, with a big white beard and twinkling eyes, the spitting image of Santa Claus.  “Well,” he said, jumping simultaneously into religion and politics in a single breath, “their parents made mistakes and now someone’s got to pay.”  \r\n\r\nA grim, heartless Santa Claus.  Until that moment, I had not understood the man.  “I guess we’d better get back to guarding the art,” I said and that is what we did.\r\n\r\nI would not confront him, not in the workplace, nor anyplace else.  Confrontation is not my way.  His deplorable remark, so harsh and hateful, still burns me, five years after he uttered it.  A great many people would agree with him and vote accordingly.  A great many others would be horrorstruck, as I was.  Our perception of such a comment grows out of our religion, our ethics, our philosophy; our reactions to such a comment play out in our politics, i.e., how we vote.  \r\n\r\nThe workplace is not the arena to explore such topics.\r\n\r\nWhat about Nature as a topic?  Is Nature a subject on which anyone can opine — anywhere, anytime -- with impunity?  She would seem to be fair game, an easy target.  Nature finds plenty of ways to wreak havoc on us but she cannot defend herself, not verbally.    \r\n\r\nWhat if she could?  What might Nature, given a voice, have to say to us?\r\n\r\nIn a scene from one of my favorite books, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, author Odell Shepard gives Nature a voice; he personifies Nature and hears her speaking to him in the guise of what he calls The Desolate Marsh.  Here is what that wetland has to say to him:\r\n\r\n	"Soft and dreamy seeker of pleasant emotions, you see no farther into reality than a painted butterfly flapping from flower to flower.  You too are convinced that the sun shines to warm your wings, that the meadows are strewn with flowers to flatter your delight in color.\r\n	Stare into my vacant eyes, older than thought, older than mind-stuff, and learn more than e’er you have in pondering the wisest of books. Your poets have not told you such things as I tell, for I remember the dinosaur’s wallowing and the scream of the saber-tooth. Peer down into the savageries of the under-sea. Think your way out into the infinity of the sky or down into the answering infinity of the atom. \r\n	Stand and look at me.  As I am now, so was the planet for innumerable ages before you came and so it will be for endless ages after you are gone. Now you may pass, for I think you will not forget."\r\n\r\nHe is nearly undone by these fierce verities.  He writes:\r\n\r\n	"No, I shall not forget.  For it set me for two or three shuddering minutes outside my little circle and I saw how that circle really looks.  And I felt the Terror of Solitude.  For even someone who can face Death cannot face the thought that life and death are utterly meaningless."\r\n\r\nHow else can any intelligent person respond?  Now see how he finds his way forward.\r\n\r\n	"Then I thought of our habitable little globe and I thought of the fires we have kindled, building them only on the edges of the abyss and lighting only our own faces against the ring of darkness, but still ... fires."\r\n\r\nThen, oh then, so movingly, so tenderly, he "remembers all the songs" and, by implication, the myriad other artifices we’ve fashioned, all of them multiloquent if we have ears to hear, transcending petty politics and even religion, “to sing us through the dark."\r\n\r\n	“Then I remembered all the songs we’ve made to sing, the brave, high-hearted songs we sing as though the dark were not, the songs that tally all our faiths, our hopes, our dreams, our joys and lamentations, our yearnings, our illusions and our heroic hopes.”\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed or already known, I set to music Shepard’s account of his encounter with the Marsh.  It’s the libretto of my cantata entitled “The Harvest of a Quiet Eye.”  Today I invite you to listen to hear two movements from the work:  the recitative “No, I shall not forget” and the aria “Then I remembered all the songs.”  .\r\n\r\nTo hear “No, I shall not forget” immediately followed by “Then I remembered all the songs,” movements 8 and 9 from my cantata "The Harvest of a Quiet Eye," in the 12/3/16 performance by the marvelously expressive baritone Bradford Gleim — his voice is perfect for this music! —  and the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus, with Edward Elwyn Jones conducting, click on the link above.\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/harvest_8_9.mp3\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score for movement 8, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score for movement 9, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nLiving in the heart of a sizable city, it’s easy to forget how beautiful Nature can be.  And how ugly.\r\n\r\nI was reminded during, of all things, an appointment with a doctor.  The knee surgeon required me to have a ‘pre-op’ physical before the knee could be replaced.  Dutifully, I made the appointment, drove to the sterile, modern Medical Arts building, parked, entered, ascended in the elevator (an uplifting experience, it took me to a whole new level), filled out forms, did a little thumb-twiddling in the waiting room, got weighed (212 lbs.) and was at length shown to an examination room.  \r\n\r\nThere, a large window looked out upon a broad forested ridge, our Eastern woodlands in full mid-May flourish, their finest hour.  Green, green, green!  Oaks, maples, beeches, tall and ancient, leaves by the billions, a-quiver in the breeze.  For a good five minutes, I watched two birds riding the currents above the trees, uplifted, taken to a whole new level.  \r\n\r\nThen the doc arrived and addressed the business at hand.\r\n\r\nCustomarily, we think of Nature as a thing of beauty.  It can also be hideous.  Have you come upon a rotting carcass, flayed and maggot-infested, strewn in your path?  That’s Nature, too, red in tooth and claw.  “Fish eating fish, bugs eating bugs, plants eating plants.  It’s an enormous restaurant, that’s how I see it,” said Woody Allen.\r\n\r\nIn his book, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, Odell Shepard recounts a two-week walking journey through rural Connecticut, undertaken in 1926.  His encounter with a desolate marsh prompts him, despite his love for Her, to ponder Nature at Her most hideous; he finds Her weirdly beautiful yet utterly grim.\r\n\r\nWhen I set to music his encounter with the marsh I had to devise music that would express the beauty of Nature but also, simultaneously, the harsh despair She communicates when She makes no attempt to conceal Her ugliness and indifference.\r\n\r\nI scored Shepard’s description of the marsh to be sung by women’s voices with the baritone narrator singing OVER the women’s voices.  It’s like a painting of a figure posed in a landscape; the baritone is the figure, the women’s voices comprise the landscape.\r\n\r\nHere is the text:\r\n\r\nWomen’s voices:  There were thirty gray acres of slate-gray water under a slate-gray sky, and over it all there hung the curse of silence and a blank despair. There were hundreds of trees, submerged to the knees, all livid in Death.\r\n\r\nBaritone:  I dared to stand and face the marsh, and to make bold to wonder what it meant.\r\nThere are no words to articulate a message devoid of all humanity; still, I tried to perceive what it had to say.\r\n\r\nWhat the marsh has to say is revealed in the movement that follows; that''s beyond the scope of today’s message.  Please keep that in mind when you find that this movement ends abruptly and inconclusively; remember that it is a prologue for what comes next, when the marsh has her say.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Thirty Gray Acres,” movement VI from my cantata "The Harvest of a Quiet Eye," in the  performance by the marvelously expressive baritone Bradford Gleim — his voice is perfect for this music! —  and the women of the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus, with Edward Elwyn Jones conducting, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne of many things to admire about Walt Whitman is that he was not afraid to contradict himself.\r\n\r\n	“Do I contradict myself?” he asks.  "Very well, I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.”\r\n\r\nFor me, music expressing hostility and menace are a contradiction.  By now, you have a feel for my music; you know that my instinct is to dole out sweetness and light, to induce smiles.\r\n\r\nI had to contradict that instinct when concocting a scene in my cantata, “The Harvest of a Quiet Eye.”\r\n\r\nThe baritone / narrator tells of hiking from a bright place to a dark place and back.  The dark place is a wetland he calls The Desolate Marsh; he is taken aback, then enlightened, by what the marsh tells him.\r\n\r\nToday I want to share the music that precedes that encounter.  The mood is tense and macabre, far from the delights in Nature her bucolic moods.\r\n\r\nJust before this music, the baritone / narrator sings these words:\r\n\r\n	"My road was now only a path in the woods, printed with hoof-marks of deer.  Once I caught a glimpse of a fox staring into my eyes. The afternoon wore away, the wind fell and the sky was filled with clouds.  The silence of the woods deepened into mystery.”\r\n\r\nThen, as you’ll hear, comes a harsh octave, the deepest “D” on the piano, thumping, ominously.  The pace is that of a scherzo, very fast, breathless.  It’s all over in two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe chorus enters:  "It was as though the trees were making secret preparations.  The air seemed alive with hostility and menace.”\r\n\r\nThen the baritone:  "I felt I was watched by many things at once from all sides.  The air seemed alive with hostility and menace, when I came to the Desolate Marsh.”\r\n\r\nThe two musical forces — chorus and soloist — combine, the short movement quickly reaches its climax, then cuts off abruptly.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is a fragment from a larger work, like a short scene from an opera.  It’s not intended to ‘stand alone.’  I think you’ll find it interesting because it’s so different, even contradictory, compared to the other pieces of my music you’ve kindly allowed me to share.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the entire cantata is going to be performed by the Thomas Circle Singers under James Kreger at 5pm on Saturday May 18, 2019 at the Church of the Epiphany, 1317 G St, NW, Washington, DC 20005.  Jo and I and our daughter, who lives in DC, will be there!

The first expresses, I think, the feelings of excitement and expansiveness so characteristic of beginnings … beginnings of journeys, beginnings of choral cantatas, all sorts of beginnings.  The second is a fugue in which the choral entrances overlap like hills rising “tier upon tier.”  I tried to catch those tones of “blue and dimmer blue” in the music by using, when the word “blue” is sung, harmonies slightly tinged with a ‘Blues’ sound.\r\n\r\nFollow the lyrics as you listen:\r\n\r\nBaritone:  I came to a road running northward, and the borders were woven with thickets of birches and maples. The yellowing leaves were atwinkle in the wind and the lane was a vista of dazzle and shine.\r\n\r\nChorus:  Here were old stone walls running through woodland, and old apple orchards recaptured by forest.\r\n\r\nBaritone and chorus:  A mile more and the lyric beauty of my road was changed into grandeur.\r\n\r\nChorus:  The hills to the north and west rose tier above tier in tones of blue and dimmer blue to the far horizon.\r\n\r\nTo hear “I came to a road running northward” followed by “The hills to the north and west,” movements 2 and 3 from my cantata "The Harvest of a Quiet Eye," in the 12/3/16 performance by the marvelously expressive baritone Bradford Gleim — his voice is perfect for this music! —  and the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus, with Edward Elwyn Jones conducting, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Friday is always grim.  This one is grimmer.  \r\n\r\nYet, how beautiful the natural world is just now!\r\n\r\nBehind our house is a small backyard, enclosed by a picket fence we''ve painted forest-green.  Behind the fence are seven noble pines, 60 feet tall.  At their knees are a dense mass of viburnum.  Behind the pines and viburnum is a vast expanse of fields and trees and sky.  The bluffs of the Little Miami River rise in the distance.\r\n\r\nWe walk there most days, having it to ourselves.  The daffodils and forsythia are passing but the redbud are a-flourish.  \r\n\r\nSpring herself is untroubled by the virus.  To her, it is boresome; she gives it no thought.  The burgeoning Japanese maples are as unaffected as the squirrels that raid our bird-feeder.\r\n\r\n“It is true that I am walking in the valley of the shadow of death … but it is a most beautiful valley and I have always loved it.”\r\n\r\nThose are the words of an author often mentioned in these messages, Odell Shepard, and they are borrowed from his masterpiece The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, one of my favorite books.  My cantata of the same title, one of my best efforts, is a setting of wise words from that book.\r\n\r\nNext Wednesday, I am going to post on-line the PDF of a remarkable book of Odell Shepard''s which I discovered, edited and brought into being, one of the meaningful undertakings of my long career.  It is a sequel to The Harvest of a Quiet Eye titled The Cabin Down the Glen.  There’s a long story behind its discovery and publication — and a good one, too — but I’ll wait until Wednesday to share it.\r\n\r\nFor now, let’s listen to the final two movements of my cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye.  The words speak to this particular Good Friday in ways I could never have imagined or anticipated when I set them to music.  \r\n\r\nAs you listen, follow these marvelous words, wise, serene, radiantly resigned:\r\n\r\n	"It is true that I am walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death and that soon I shall lie down there, never to rise, and that every flower and face and thought that I have known, together with all that my fellows have thought and dreamed and made, will lie there very soon beside me.  \r\n\r\n	But yet it is a most beautiful valley and I have always loved it and I love it more deeply at every step that brings me nearer the end.  \r\n\r\n	Why then should I grieve to lie here forever?  The oak and the maple are dying too and they comfort me.  For they do not dwindle and pine into the grave but go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas as though they have some expectation of joy, some intuition that from this dying world unimaginable life may spring as the new year springs from the ruins of the old.  In such company at least I can say that I will fear no evil.\r\n\r\n	The sun was setting behind the mountain and a breeze awoke in the sky.  The new moon was blown bare, blown bare of clouds and the stars shown round her like a shining wreath.  By her pale illumination I found my way.  I strode along with high-hearted singing until at last I could see the bridge and finally the light of my inn at the far end shining."\r\n\r\n\r\nThat last line touches me deeply; when I hear this music my throat tightens, tears come.  I want to raise a hand and wave goodbye to Odell Shepard, this good man, as he is crossing over and, I imagine, waving back at me.  When my turn comes to cross over, I aspire to raise my hand and wave, making that same radiant gesture of farewell and in just the same spirit.  I will ask my friend Chris Miller to sing these two movements at my funeral, if funerals are a possibility by then.  \r\n\r\nMay such an occasion be a good ways off yet for all of us!  But who knows?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, quite literally, for however long I have left, I intend to stride along with high-hearted singing -- in every sense of the word!  I earnestly wish that this music may help inspire the same impluse in you.\r\n\r\nTo hear the last two movements of The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, in the 12/3/16 performance by the marvelously expressive Boston baritone Bradford Gleim — his voice is perfect for this music! —  and the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus under the direction of Edward Elwyn Jones, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nI can add nothing to these stirring, Easter-ish words Odell Shepard wrote in 1926 and which comprise the lyrics of the choral work I want to share with you today:\r\n\r\n	"It may be that Nature did not foresee us, but in all her kingdoms she has brought forth no other such pathetic and marvelous thing as this human heart, so trivial and heroic, so dauntless though so filled with fears, that can smile into the eyes of Death.”\r\n\r\nTo hear “It May Be That Nature,” from my cantata The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, text by Odell Shepard, performed by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus, with Edward Elwyn Jones conducting, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nThis Wednesday I will announce a website offering a PDF where Odell Shepard’s sequel to The Harvest of a Quiet Eye can be read on line or downloaded for free, to be read later.  \r\n\r\nMy discovery of the manuscript of this lost book, titled The Cabin Down the Glen, and my editing and publishing of it, was one of the most meaningful endeavors of my long career and makes for a good story, which I’ll also share on Wednesday.  \r\n\r\nFew of you have read this book, though many of you have some awareness of it, as I have often quoted it in these emails and shared my musical settings of portions of the text.  \r\n\r\nA book written by a man discovering richness and depth during a period of self-imposed isolation speaks to our present circumstance in ways I could not have imagined when I brought the book to light in 2006.\r\n\r\nHere is the description from the back cover of The Cabin Down the Glen:\r\n\r\n	When Pulitzer Prize-winning author Odell Shepard turned 50, he retreated to a cabin in the deep-forest solitude of his beloved northwestern Connecticut to write this book.  In clear, elegant prose, Shepard draws insights from things common and near to hand:  bird song, spring water, stone walls and starry nights.  Yet, pondering the signposts of his passing youth, present maturity and eventual decline, his thinking brings him to the brink of mysticism.  Written in 1935, published now for the first time, The Cabin Down the Glen will engage admirers of Walden, The Outermost House and Pilgrim at Tinker Creek   ... and all who love Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),11);

Auburn Presbyterian Church choir in which I have the pleasure of singing.  He is also a fine baritone, pianist, guitarist and trumpeter.  In 2007, he asked me to write something “American-sounding” for trumpet and piano that he could play as an offertory.\r\n\r\nWhat is more American-sounding than Richard Rodgers’ score for “Oklahoma!”?  The show opens with the cowboy Curly singing, “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’.”  I decided to meet Chris’ request by paying homage to Richard Rodgers and to that song in particular.  \r\n\r\nMy piece begins and ends with Curly doing his cowboy thing.  I picture him strutting along, thumbs in his belt, cowboy hat tilted back on his head, whistling at the girls and smiling broadly.  But Curly has a reverential side, too.  Night falls and the music calms down.  Gazing up in wonder and gratitude at the stars above the prairie, Curly is moved to pray a prayer of Thanksgiving.  You’ll hear it.  And when the prayer is concluded, you’ll hear Curly  dust himself off and resume his strut and head into town, looking for fun.\r\n\r\nIn the score, I ask the trumpeter to wear a cowboy hat for the opening and final sections of the piece, but to remove it for the prayerful middle section.\r\n\r\nListen carefully and you’ll hear “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” peeking around the corners as the trumpet and piano weave fragments of the famous tune into the texture of the piece.  The entire opening phrase of the song is only heard once, at the very end.\r\n\r\nEven without being told in advance that a well-known tune was being quoted, I think you’d probably sense that there was something familiar about what you were hearing.  But I think you would be unable to identify it until the very end.  Then you’d say, “Ah-HAH!  So THAT’s why I thought I recognized something!"\r\n\r\nThe piece has never been recorded in its original trumpet/piano version.  In fact, hardly anyone has ever heard this music.  Chris played it in church once or twice but through the miracle of technology, today’s email miraculously, serves it up for the first time to you and many other friends and fans.   \r\n\r\nWhat times we live in, when such miracles are possible for people of modest means, like me.  When I think of this, I feel prompted, like Curly, to pray prayers of Thanksgiving.  Thirty years ago, the only way I could have shared this music with you would have been to produce an LP and mail it to you.  The cost would have been enormous and prohibitive.  Now, it’s almost free and requires little more than the energy it takes to press a few keys on my computer.\r\n\r\nYou will hear clarinetist Laurel Bennett and collaborative pianist Carol Alexander playing “Curly Prays:  Homage to Richard Rodgers,” by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 1, 2015\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week we were loudly informed that ...\r\n\r\n	“...our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that [sic] were villains.” \r\n\r\nIn my six years as a teacher of French, Music Theory & History and The Art of Storytelling at a Cincinnati alternative school called “Leaves of Learning,” I thought I knew what I was doing.\r\n\r\nI thought I was showing the “children” how to unlock and employ the lovely symmetry of French verbs, to understand exactly how a fugue unfolds, to recognize, appreciate and learn to utilize the ‘tug’ a well-told story can exert upon listeners.  \r\n\r\nI thought I was encouraging critical thinking when we translated quotations I’d written in French on the chalk board and then led a discussion, mostly in French, of what the quotations meant, whether or not they seemed true and wise, how we might apply what wisdom we found in them.   \r\n\r\nFor example:  \r\n\r\n	“Servir la patrie est une moitié du devoir, servir l’humanité est l’autre moitié.”  \r\n	(translation:  Serving the homeland is one half of [one’s] duty, serving humanity is the other half.)			\r\n						-- Victor Hugo\r\n\r\nI thought I was fostering listening skills in my Music Theory & History class when we considered Charles Ives’ use of deliberate ambiguity in his music, his eccentric knack of simultaneously paying homage to, yet parodying, Protestant hymns and the patriotic tunes of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI thought I was opening eyes and minds of wanna-be storytellers when we considered how a painting can tell a story by examining Edward Hick’s “The Peaceable Kingdom,” in which Native Americans and European settlers are peacefully trading goods in the background while in the foreground a lion, a wolf, a leopard and a bear lie down alongside lambs, a cow, a goat and little children.  Why would Hicks, a Quaker preacher, paint such an image?  Was he depicting our actual history or an idealization of it?  Was he prophesying a better future?  What questions does the painting raise for us in our own time?  Does it depict our world today in any sense?  What would we have to change before that painting could serve as an accurate metaphor for the world we know? \r\n\r\nThose were some of the things I thought I was teaching.  It turns out that in fact I was teaching my students “to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but ... villains.” \r\n\r\nNo worries.  I won’t be teaching this Fall.  I’m on sabbatical until there is a vaccine and it is safe for me to set foot inside the school building again.  A septuagenarian with incipient heart disease, I take no chances.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you could teach on-line!” some say.\r\n\r\nNo.  Been there, done that.  When school reconvened ‘on-line’ after spring break, I taught ‘virtually’ for the last two months of the school year.  It was dreadful.  I never mastered the technology, though I tried.  Worse, the human rituals of ‘facial mimicry,’ essential to teaching a language or the art of storytelling, are impossible in a Zoom meeting.  Teaching Music Theory without access to a piano is inefficacious.\r\n\r\nBe assured, my students had no inkling that I disliked teaching on-line.  I concealed my frustrations, kept smiling, did my usual best to assure them that their ideas had value, to help them to feel good about themselves and about what they were achieving. \r\n\r\nI even managed to elicit a few laughs, despite the constraints of teaching on-line.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I led my advanced French class through a tour of our home, carrying my computer from room to room, showing them the furnishings, the paintings, the collections, explaining as I went, en français. \r\n\r\nThen I went outside to show them our front porch, our picket fence, our landscaping, etc.  Alas, without realizing it, I strayed too far from the wifi signal and went on speaking for five minutes without knowing that I had “left the meeting.”  \r\n\r\nAt length, I noticed that when I asked questions, there were no responses.  Embarrassed to find that I had been talking only to myself, I came back inside the house where the wifi kicked in again.  When I rejoined the on-line meeting, one of my students, the class wise guy, said “At last!  The Prodigal Professor has returned!”  \r\n\r\nI apologized for my inadvertent absence and then we translated his clever quip into French:  “Enfin!  Le professeur prodigueux est revenu!”  Never let a teachable moment slip by!\r\n\r\nI told them what had happened and then I added that it was really too bad because somehow or other I had digressed from the tour and started telling all of my favorite dirty jokes.  I told them that I had wondered why no one was laughing until I realized that I had left the meeting by going beyond the range of my wifi signal.  Too bad, I said, all those great dirty jokes and they hadn’t been able to hear any of them.  \r\n\r\nThey screamed in mock dismay and begged me to tell them the jokes but I refused on the grounds that it just wouldn’t be the same the second time.  No joke is ever as funny the second time you hear or tell it.  \r\n\r\nThey knew I was teasing, which made it all the more funny.  \r\n\r\n“Oh come on, Monsieur Sauvage, please, please, please!” they begged.  “Tell us one!  Just one!  Just one!”  \r\n\r\nMais non.  Je suis resté ferme.  J’ai refusé.\r\n\r\nThat was fun.\r\n\r\nBut wait!  Come to think of it, I was corrupting young people by alluding to sexuality, albeit obliquely and with humorous intent.  Between that and teaching them to “hate our country,” I guess I should be thoroughly ashamed of myself.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it’s just as well that I’m taking a sabbatical so that I can get my priorities straight.\r\n\r\nIn Music Theory & History, we listened to and considered a few of my own works.  Although I am not one of the Great Masters I believe that students benefit from hearing music written by someone they actually know, someone living in our own time and place.\r\n\r\nOne of the pieces we listened to was my ironical homage/parody of the music of Richard Rodgers, a piece for clarinet and piano titled, “Curly Prays.”\r\n\r\nWhat is more American than Richard Rodgers’ score for “Oklahoma!”?  The musical opens with the cowboy Curly singing “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’.”  I decided to pay homage to Richard Rodgers by teasing his spirit a little as regards that song in particular.  \r\n\r\nMy piece begins and ends with Curly doing his cowboy thing.  I picture him strutting along, thumbs in his belt, hat tilted back on his head, flirting with the girls and smiling broadly.  But it turns out that Curly has a reverential side, too.  Night falls and the music calms down.  Gazing up in wonder and gratitude at the starry sky above the vast prairie, Curly kneels. He prays a prayer of Thanksgiving.  When the prayer is concluded, Curly seems to spring to his feet, stretch, dust himself off and resume his strut, headin’ into town, lookin’ for fun.\r\n\r\nListen carefully and you’ll hear “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” peeking around the corners during the middle ‘prayer’ section as the clarinet and piano weave fragments of the famous tune into the texture of the music.  The entire opening phrase of Rodger’s great song is heard at the very end of the piece.\r\n\r\nIf you didn’t know in advance that a tune was being quoted, you’d probably sense something familiar in what you were hearing, but find yourself unable to identify it until the very end.  \r\n\r\nThen you’d say, “Ah-HAH!  So THAT’s why I thought I recognized it!"\r\n\r\nBut wait!  “There you go again,” making fun of a great American composer and a cowboy character, teaching our children to to “hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but … villains.”  Well, my Curly is not a villain, more a cocky galoot.  \r\n\r\nBut evoking the sacred act of prayer in the middle of a parody?\r\n\r\nShame!  Shame on me!  I just can’t stay out of trouble!\r\n\r\nYou can hear clarinetist Laurel Bennett and pianist Carol Alexander playing “Curly Prays:  Homage to Richard Rodgers,” by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),141);

My brothers and I sang and danced along with her; we knew the all words.  \r\n\r\nI was very eager to meet him.  An hour before showtime he had not arrived and I was nervous.  A half hour before showtime, my stage manager, shaking his head, informed me that Mr. Calloway was in the dressing room.  Something was wrong.  I went backstage.\r\n\r\nHe was in his dressing room, yes, but he looked to be a hundred years old.  He was slumped in his chair, a very old, very tired black man in a sleeveless undershirt, staring at his knees.  I said hello.  He raised one hand in a half-wave but hardly looked up.  I told him I was a fan and that we were really looking forward to his show.  He grunted.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to say so I joined my wife in the audience.  “Hoo boy,” I told her.  “I don’t know about this.”\r\n\r\nAt length the lights went down, the band played the introduction to one of his songs, the spotlight beamed a bright circle on stage right … and we waited.  Suddenly, he came strutting out, head high, shoulders back, flashing his famous, toothy, million-dollar smile, sporting a magnificent, powder-blue tuxedo.  The Hi-Dee-Ho Man had arrived!  \r\n\r\nFor two hours, he wowed the audience, singing, dancing, telling jokes and stories and getting us all to sway our hands with him, echoing his “Hi-dee-ho’s” right on cue.\r\n\r\nStanding ovation.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he made his way up the aisle of the empty theatre to my office. He was standing tall, his tux in a clothes bag over his shoulder.  I paid him the balance of his fee, just as his contract had specified:  twenty-five one-hundred dollar bills.  He took out his wallet and it was as thick as a triple cheeseburger, stuffed with hundred-dollar bills.  He must have been carrying $40,000 in that wallet.  Cash.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of his carrying that amount of cash on the streets of downtown Mansfield being none of my business, I just told him how much we had all loved the show.  \r\n\r\nThen I added, “I have to tell you that you had me pretty worried when I saw you in your dressing room before the show.”  He asked me why.  “Well, you just seemed really tired and I didn’t know what to expect.”  \r\n\r\nHe laughed and said, “Ma-a-a-an, you got to learn to re-LAX!”  I laughed too and thanked him again.  We shook hands.  I watched him shuffle out the front door of the theatre and across Park Avenue West to the Travel Lodge.  A legendary figure of the Harlem Renaissance, a great performer, an artist who knew when to relax and when to expend his energy, he was also, at that moment, a solitary, elderly black man on the streets of downtown Mansfield, late at night, with $40,000 in his wallet.  I kept an eye on him from the theatre door until he had safely entered the motel lobby.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, it occurred to me that our church choir at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian here in Cincinnati would have a blast belting out some Cab Calloway-style “hi-dee-hi-dee-ho’s.” I adapted a quotation from G.B. Shaw because it expressed the “bright and shiny” optimism Cab put across so convincingly.  I rewrote Shaw’s words so that they would rhyme and I worked in some “hi-dee-ho’s.”   \r\n\r\nTo hear the Northern Kentucky Community Choir sing "Clean Up!” under the direction of Stephanie Nash, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 15, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),6);

For her, I wrote my quirky harpsichord suite, an improbable blending of Baroque music with the Blues.\r\n\r\nThe suite’s Prelude develops two ideas:  the rising, Bach-like, arpeggiated chord you’ll hear right off the bat and a Blues-y descending figure — C - Bflat - G - Fsharp — that appears a bit later.   \r\n\r\nThis faint echo of the Blues persists throughout this little piece, giving it a contemporary feel that is pleasantly at odds with the antique plucking sounds of the harpsichord.\r\n\r\nHow to title such a piece?  “Suite in C?”  Too pale for such a colorful blend of styles.  It occurred to me to name the piece for Barbara herself.

She declared herself amused by the title and liked the piece well enough to premier it and record it.   What’s more, she later asked me to write a flute-and-harpsichord sonata for her, which I did.

France, a country of 60 million, does not have, so far as I have seen, a single front porch.  \r\n\r\nFrench people love to escape the interiors of their homes, to pass time outside, to dine al fresco.  But they set up their dwelling places with outdoor access to the rear, not the front.  They create miniature worlds behind their homes, delightful flower gardens with water features and plenty of shady places designed specifically for enjoyment and surrounded with high walls.  No one sees in or out.\r\n\r\nWalking the streets of French villages or the residential areas of cities, one never glimpses these spaces, so well are they concealed.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, Americans cherish comfortable, well-appointed front porches.  We take to our front porches to drink our morning coffee, read the paper, retrieve email or just sit on a rocking chair, fingers interlocked across our bellies, content to be entertained by anything that might be happening on the sidewalk and street.  How very un-French!\r\n \r\nPeople who live on Brinkerhoff Boulevard, in Mansfield, Ohio, have it good.  Their homes are turn-of-the-century, spacious and elegant.  Their front porches look out onto South Park, right across the street.  Mansfield’s iconic pioneer Blockhouse, the park’s best-known feature, is in plain view; built during the War of 1812, it was frequented by Johnny Appleseed himself.\r\n\r\nBrinkerhoff Boulevard is one of ten streets evoked in my Street Suite for violin and clarinet.  The gentle rhythm of the music matches the slow ’n'' easy, back-and-forth motion of a rocking chair.  With the Blockhouse just across the way, the thoughts of those slowly rocking front porch daydreamers stray back to earlier times.

That''s the duration of the mp3 you can hear by clicking on the third link above.  19 seconds.\r\n\r\nIt will take longer than that to read what I want to tell you about this piece.\r\n\r\nHow short can a piece of music be and still seem complete?  What''s the shortest piece by a Big Name composer?  Chopin''s so-called Minute Waltz comes to mind, but that piece actually requires a little under two minutes to perform.  The shortest piece I know is one of Beethoven''s piano bagatelles, which clocks in at 13 seconds.\r\n\r\nWell, here''s a very short piece by the undersigned, who is a Little Name composer.\r\n\r\nIt''s been almost forty years since I wrote the music you''ll hear on this recording, entitled "Beethoven Street."  It''s from a piece called "Street Suite"-- ten very short movements about streets in Mansfield, Ohio, the town where I was born and reared, played by clarinetist Craig Olzenak and violinist Ken Goldsmith.  I wanted the music to have that rumbustious energy we associate with Beethoven.  And since it''s a short street, it had to be a short piece of music.\r\n\r\nForty years!  Yet when you hear this, it will be as fresh as this morning''s sunrise.  That''s the great thing about classical music.  It has no ''shelf time.''   A piece of music that is new to us feels like it was written five minutes ago.  Amazing.\r\n\r\nI wrote the "Street Suite" shortly after getting free of college, after five hard years of servitude.  Ugh.  At last I was free to write the music I wanted to write, well outside the groves of Academe, where I have thrived ever since.  I think the joyfulness of this new freedom can be heard in the music.  But I don''t want to make too much of it;  it''s just a little piece; it attempts nothing grander than a little smile.  And that''s OK.  Let us never undervalue things that prompt little smiles.  They are sorely needed in this sad old world.\r\n\r\nTo hear Beethoven Street played by violinist Ken Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak, click on the third link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI like to imagine that someone must have asked the late Neil Armstrong, born and raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio, “What’s the furthest you’ve ever been from home?”\r\n\r\nMy answer would be Taiwan, 13,000 miles distant from Mansfield, Ohio, my hometown, a two-hour drive east of “WAH-pock,” as Wapakonetians call their hometown.\r\n\r\nI got to Taiwan thrice, for a dozen days each time, leading cultural exchange tours.  Taipei County, Taiwan and Richland County, Ohio, are sister counties.  Organizing exchange tours was a fun part of my work when I served as a County Commissioner, 1986-1990.  (I am, so far as I know, the only American composer of classical music ever elected to a public office.)\r\n\r\nWe got to see Taipei, Taiwan''s capitol city, as well as the country’s rugged coast, its mountains peaking at 13,000 feet, the Polynesian culture that still thrives in the interior, Yang Ming Shan National Park, and the great museum displaying the personal art objects cherished by a 5,000-year-long string of Chinese Emperors.\r\n\r\nThe objet d''art in the museum that most impressed me was a peach pit.  It was exhibited in a glass case with Sherlock-style magnifying glasses mounted on four sides so that visitors could give it the close inspection it deserved.  \r\n\r\nIt was carved into the shape of a tiny boat afloat on the wavelets of a diminutive stream, with a miniscule pagoda mid-ships in which sat a scholar holding an infinitesimal cup of tea from which — I swear — a hair’s breadth tendril of steam curled upward!  \r\n\r\nAll this!  A carved peach pit!\r\n  \r\nAfter a long series of grand banquets provided by our generous hosts, Jo and I were afforded an evening to ourselves.  We had been amazed by the Chinese cuisine but amazement can be wearying.  We were eager to find familiar fare.\r\n\r\nOur Chinese hosts deposited us in a so-called “Western” restaurant.  We took the decor to be an expression of the Chinese notion of Western civilization.  There was a bust of Beethoven next to the cash register and a print of Monet’s Water Lilies on the wall, displayed, oddly, in a shiny, bright red, Chinese picture frame.  \r\n\r\nBut the most striking exhibit inviting us to imagine that we had, for the nonce, left China and re-entered Western civilization awaited us in the center of the dining room.   \r\n\r\nA low, circular wall of bricks enclosed an area over which sand had been spread, covering the floorboards.  Prominently placed in the sand were three large, shiny, plastic objets d''art.  One was a cream-colored plastic Greek column, about five feet tall, made to look as if it was broken, a ruin, the crumbling remnant of a temple.  The second was a glistening, green, plastic cactus plant, about six feet tall.  \r\n\r\nThe third — I am not inventing this — was a figure about four feet tall, clad in his traditional blue nautical jacket, his white sailor’s hat tilted back on his head, his smiling bill a bright yellow.  Yes, there he stood, pleased to take his place between the phony Greek column and the fake cactus, that enduring emblem of Western civilization:  Donald Duck.\r\n\r\nApparently, for the restaurant''s regular Chinese customers, those three objects, taken together, proclaimed “The West.” \r\n\r\nThe food was, well … you can imagine.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the decor in our local Chinese restaurants, to say nothing of menu items like Chop Suey and fortune cookies, would probably seem just as absurd to any Chinese people who might eat there as the decor of the “Western” restaurant in Taipei seemed to us.  Enter most any Chinese restaurant in Ohio and what do you see?  A plastic Buddha, some more-or-less Chinese art on the walls, in bright red frames, weird red lanterns hanging from the acoustic tile ceiling, a large photo of the Great Wall.  We glance and think, “Yes, definitely Chinese.”  What do we know?  Most Chinese would probably find plenty to laugh about in such a display.\r\n\r\nThe ten short movements of my Street Suite for violin and clarinet attempt to depict and evoke ten streets in my hometown, Mansfield, Ohio.  For me, there is an affinity between the music I wrote and the actual streets, just as, I’m sure, the decorators of the “Western” restaurant in Taipei believed that something of Western Civilization was expressed in the display they had fashioned.  The people who reside in the homes that line West Second Street in Mansfield, Ohio would likely be just as surprised by this music as we were by the column, the cactus and the Donald.\r\n\r\nAll I can say is, this music works for me.\r\n\r\nTo hear “West Second Street” from my Street Suite played by violinist Ken Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nFifty years ago today — December 10, 1967 — I ventured on a blind date with Jo Ackerman.  We attended the Mansfield Symphony’s production of “Swan Lake” featuring the Butler Ballet.  Then we went to a restaurant.  \r\n\r\nJo likes to tell how she noticed that I cut my spaghetti into little pieces with my fork and butter knife, pushed the severed noodles onto my spoon and sent ‘em ‘down the hatch.''  That was how my family ate spaghetti.  Contrariwise, she came from a family that used fork and spoon to twirl the noodles before consigning them to the fulfillment of their preordained destiny.\r\n\r\nDespite my having failed The Spaghetti Test, she fell in love with me and I with her.  We’ve been married to each other for forty five years.\r\n\r\nJo''s mother was my Senior English teacher but Jo and I did not attend the same high school.   Phil Lichtenstein, my classmate and best friend, knew Jo because they had the same piano teacher and he had dated her a couple of times.  He was my source of information about her and, from what he said, I thought she sounded ''pretty cool'' (as I would have expressed it in those days).\r\n\r\nShe was pretty cool!  Still is!\r\n\r\nThough our maternal grandfathers had been the closest of friends some decades earlier, Jo and I had never set eyes on one another.  In the days before our date, I wondered what she would be like.  I cannot now conceive of any event that, scheduled in the near future, would cause me as much pleasant anticipation as that blind date did in the days that preceded it.  I was excited! \r\n\r\nI remember ascending the steps to the front porch of her home, ringing the door bell, watching the door swing open.  There she was!  I remember her wheaten hair, her dark blue eyes, the pale pumpkin-orange dress she wore.  She was petite, very feminine, adorable!\r\n\r\nShe was 16, I was 17.  That date was our first adventure together.\r\n\r\nWhat would excite me that much now?  About the only comparably exciting thing I can imagine would be the announcement that a grandchild was on the way.   (Scant chance of that happening anytime soon, both our kids being single.  Oh well.)\r\n\r\nSix years earlier, in June of 1961, I was even more excited by the prospect of my first week away from home, to be passed in the jolly company of the merry Scouts of Troop 152 at Camp Avery Hand, the summer camp of Mansfield''s Johnny Appleseed Boy Scout Council.\r\n\r\nNo upcoming travel adventure, now, would stir as much excitement in me as the journey from my home to Camp Avery Hand did back then.  If I were leaving tomorrow for Tahiti or Machu Picchu or Tibet I would not be half as “stoked” as I was the day before my departure for Camp Avery Hand, ten miles distant from the home of the Sowash family.\r\n\r\nMarion Avenue was the route one took from our house to Camp Avery Hand and, for me, the very name of the street, “Marion Avenue” -- the old road from Mansfield, Ohio to Marion, Ohio, a name that now seems so prosaic, so commonplace -- rang like a clarion, heralding enterprise, adventure, extravagance and, yes, romance.  \r\n\r\nNot romance in the amorous sense, no.  Not when I was eleven.  That kind of romance would come later.  Rather, the two words, "Marion Avenue," evoked in me the romance that arose from the prospect of getting “out there” at long last, off and away into the wider world, where every object, every encounter, every moment, just by virtue of its remoteness from my everyday existence, would be imbued with glamour and mystery.\r\n\r\n(Mrs. Ackerman, my Senior English teacher, later my mother-in-law, would not have admired that last sentence.  She would have drawn an “X” through it and written “run-on sentence!” in the margin.  Still, I’ll let it stand.) \r\n\r\nToday, at 67, I can string words together well enough.  But something wonderful has been lost.  Nothing musters in me the excitement that ‘run-on sentence’ attempts to describe.  \r\n\r\nIf I were leaving for Tahiti tomorrow, I’d be saying to myself, “Well, it’s bound to be a beautiful place and on the whole pretty great, and what not.  But, on the other hand, getting there will be a long haul.  Sitting in an airplane all that time will be a major drag.  My feet will probably swell up.  They say Tahiti is awfully humid and I’ll probably get sunburned.  Really, how great can it actually be, when all is said and done?”  \r\n\r\nI’d already be anticipating the relief of getting back home afterwards, safe and sound.\r\n\r\nBut when I was eleven, on the verge of departure for summer camp?  Ah!\r\n\r\nWhen I was twenty six, I captured and expressed that boyish excitement, musically, in the “Marion Avenue" movement of my Street Suite, ten short pieces for violin and clarinet, each evoking a street in Mansfield, Ohio, my home town.  \r\n\r\nWhen you listen to “Marion Avenue,” try to remember what it was like when you were a pre-adolescent and had the capacity to become so excited that you almost thought you might burst.\r\n\r\nThose were the days ….\r\n\r\nTo hear “Marion Avenue" played by violinist Ken Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWould that the first few seconds of your hearing the music I want to share today could be as other-worldly wonderful as your first bite into a plump and impeccable apricot!\r\n\r\nEnvision the scenario.  Smiling, your beloved gracefully places before you a hand-painted Provençal earthenware bowl, brimful of apricots.  Choosing one, you gently press your thumb, first and second fingers into it.  Fleshiest of fruits, perfectly ripe, it surrenders, in equal measure, the concave impressions of the gentle pressure of your convex and fleshy fingertips.  \r\n\r\nMindful as a Buddhist, you lift this gustatory treasure to your mouth.  Nearing your opening lips, its perfume permeates your nostrils.  Close your eyes and sink your incisors into this, the sweetest, the most brazenly luscious, the most unabashedly sensual of foodstuffs.  \r\n\r\nTo what, other than the tenderest, most leisurely love-making, can the first bite into a perfectly ripe apricot be compared?\r\n\r\nIn shape and hue and odor it is the virginal sister of the rose with the one great additional virtue that, unlike the flower, it can be eaten.\r\n\r\nAll winter long Kroger’s offered only the orange family of fruits, plucked green for all I know, maybe spray-painted orange, trucked hundreds of miles.  We yearned for apricots, asked after them, but they were not to be had.  “Not until June,” we were told.  With a sigh, we settled for oranges, clementines and tangerine ‘cuties’ while apricots dwelt in our dreams.  \r\n\r\nNow, at last, midsummer is upon us and we discover once again that, while there is much to be said on behalf of berries, grapes, peaches and canteloupes, apricots are something more, much more:  apricots are a dream that really does come true.  Here it is at last, this largess, this bounty!  Miserable sinners, however we struggle to live virtuously we always know that apricots are a reward far better than we dare hope to deserve. \r\n\r\nWhat possible act of do-good-ery might we conceive and execute that would render us worthy the ecstasy, the exquisite pleasure of that first plunge of teeth and tongue into the inviolate delight that we, constrained by the clumsiness of language, have termed the “apricot.”  The word evokes inevasible images of apes lollygagging on flimsy camp beds, “cots.”  \r\n\r\n“Apricots?"  Really?  That’s how the language of Shakespeare christens the Fruit Supreme?\r\n\r\nPerhaps sensing the inadequacy of the appellation “apricot," Shakespeare develops its comic potential.\r\n\r\nTitania, queen of the fairy folk in "A Midsummer Night’s Dream," instructs her attendants to feed her paramour, Nick Bottom, "with apricocks and dewberries.”  Apricocks?  Theatre-goers exchange furtive glances.  Did Titania really say “apricocks?”  Is it a typo, a mispronunciation, a Freudian slip? (300 years before Freud, yes, I know!)  Or is it, like much else in the play, a slightly dirty joke?  \r\n\r\nWhy name the fairy queen “Titania?"  \r\n\r\nWhy name the guy who gets half-turned into an ass “Bottom?"  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, I had an illustrated children’s book, recounting the plots of a dozen of the Bard''s best-known plays.  I knew the names of most of the characters though I was not always clear on the spellings.  For example, I thought my piano teacher had graduated from the “Oberon Conservatory of Music" because that was what the framed diploma she displayed in her studio seemed to say.  To me, it made sense to honor a fairy king by naming a music school after him.\r\n\r\nOberon seemed a proper name for a fairy king but consider the moniker Shakespeare assigns to Oberon''s sidekick, his right-hand-man, his fixer.  Fred?  Ralph?  Charlie?  Oh, no.  Shakespeare had to go and name him … well, you know.\r\n\r\nAs a boy, riding around Mansfield, Ohio in the back seat of my parent’s car I would sometimes spot, here and there, what I thought was the name of Oberon’s sidekick, crudely scrawled.  I could not understand why anyone would spray-paint the name of Oberon’s sidekick onto the backsides of stop signs or the undersides of bridges or the walls of factories.  \r\n\r\nI asked my mother about this and she said that Bad Boys sometimes wrote that word here and there.  I asked her why but I never got an answer that made any sense.  Why Bad Boys went around the town randomly spray-painting the name of one of Shakespeare’s characters here and there was just going to have to remain another of the many mysteries which I was apparently never going to understand.   \r\n\r\nWe have digressed; now we return to the apricot.  The most striking aspect of this peerless fruit is that its unique taste is just what you would expect it to be, given its unique color.\r\n\r\nWhere else do we see the color of the interior of an apricot?  Carrots and sweet potatoes are pale and never glisten.  Fresh Copper River salmon comes close.  Every now and again one comes upon a day lily boasting the color of an apricot.  Sometimes, briefly, a sunset will serve up an apricot-colored spoonful of cloud-sherbet.\r\n\r\nYou are invited to contemplate all this as you listen to "Maplewood Avenue." To be honest, the taste and color of apricots was not what I had in mind when I wrote this music more than forty years ago.  Maplewood Avenue was the street where my piano teacher, Eileen Eckert, a graduate of the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, lived.  The homes on that street were mansion-ettes built in the Tudor-style that was popular in the 1920’s; each with a winding path through tall, dark pines from the street to the front door, walls of ivy-covered stone, gables "of clay-and-wattles made."  To me, a little boy, walking to my piano teacher’s house, Maplewood Avenue seemed exotic and ancient, a place of mystery and secrets.  \r\n\r\nListening to this music nowadays, for reasons not entirely clear, it makes me think of apricocks … er ... apricots.\r\n\r\nHere it is, played by violinist Kenneth Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak.\r\n\r\nTo listen, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 10 Downing Street, the most famous London address must surely be 221B Baker Street, the apartment shared by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.\r\n\r\nRummaging in our basement last week, I came on a book I purchased years ago entitled, “Letters to Sherlock Holmes,” a collection of epistles addressed to "Sherlock Holmes, 221B Baker Street, London, U.K."\r\n\r\nLetters addressed to the great detective began arriving not long after “A Scandal in Bohemia” (the first Sherlock story) made a splash and have, if the book''s preface is to be believed, never ceased arriving and at the rate of about 700 per year.\r\n\r\nDoyle spun out of thin air what he thought was a fictional address, little knowing that the characters said to dwell therein would become a phenomenon.  He did not trouble himself to determine whether or not there actually was such an address in London.  He never dreamed that thousands of enthralled readers, convinced that Sherlock was a real person, would write to him, directing the London postal service to deliver the envelopes to 221B Baker Street.\r\n\r\nIt happens that the Abbey National Building Society is located at 221 Baker Street (there is no apartment B), and has received these letters for decades.  With admirable good cheer, the organization has, for years, assigned the secretary who opens the mail the cheery chore of reading and replying, albeit briefly, to every one of the letters addressed to Mr. Holmes.  (This strikes me as a very English thing to do, but what do I know?)\r\n\r\nThe oddest and most entertaining of the letters were published in this book.  Some are sad, some are truly intriguing (one concerns a lost treasure and a damaged map purporting to guide seekers to its location), some are bizarre.  Some assert that the writer of the letter knows full well that Sherlock is fictional but that there HAS to be a real detective somewhere at the back of these remarkable stories; it is to HIM, whomever he may be, that these appeals are directed.  Some are written to Doyle, asking the author to forward the letter to Sherlock.  Most of them seem to express a genuine belief that the great detective is actual, alive and well.  \r\n\r\nThere is one that begins:\r\n\r\n“Dear Mr. Holmes, \r\n	I am at my wit’s end.  I dare not give particulars here … a small fortune in gold coins and the good name of a kindly South African heiress hang in the balance…."\r\n\r\nSome are written, with touching earnestness, in hilariously bad English:  \r\n\r\n“My Dear Mr. Holmes,\r\n	I am your fan in Japan.  I have read a lot of story of you.  I am sure that you are more wonderful than any other private detective.  Not only I, but also my friend says so.  Why are you so ability?\r\n	I want to be like you.  If so, I would have been in favor.\r\n	I wish you will be active.  Be careful to catch a cold!\r\n	Very truly yours,\r\n		Yukari Sakai”\r\n\r\n“Dear Sherlock Holmes,\r\n	I am much honored by writing a letter to you because you are the world’s greatest genius of a detective I have ever seen.  Oh, what a fantastic escape you had from that worst waterfall!  \r\n	O God, how I waited and waited for a single book of yours.\r\n	Thanks to God, thanks to Conan Doyle and thanks very much to you for the world’s most beautiful adventures.\r\n	Moreover how could we Indians forget the British, at least they were here for a hundred years of ruling.\r\n	Long live the genius Sherlock Holmes!\r\n	Your greatest fan,\r\n		Mohamed Salim"\r\n\r\nSome are from children:\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr. Holmes,\r\n	I’m trying to become a detective but every time something is missing in my house, it’s just because someone lost it.  If something is stolen, I can never get a suspect. \r\n	Could you please give me a few ideas on how to look for good clues and how to make a suspect show himself?\r\n	Sincerely,\r\n		John Fox”\r\n\r\nIs there another fictional character who has risen from mere ink and paper to assume a comparably convincing corporality?\r\n\r\nMy favorite of all the letters I will keyboard below for your delight.  In my opinion, it is a spoof but I love it because the writer parodies so precisely and affectionately the qualities we love about the stories.  He catches the queerness of the characters that enter, along with us, into Holmes’ eccentric world.  What’s more, it seems laden with hints and clues; doubtless this conundrum would afford plenteous scope for Sherlock’s peculiar talents.  A two-pipe problem!  In its way, it is a minor masterpiece.  \r\n\r\n"Dear Mr. Holmes,\r\n	I hope you can help me with a small but important problem.  Being of a nervous disposition, several years ago I was ordered by my doctor to take up a relaxing hobby.  As I am competitive by nature I selected an unusual hobby which could not be easily duplicated.\r\n	I hope you will not laugh when I tell you my hobby is collecting pieces of aluminum foil which I roll into a ball.  Well, Mr. Holmes, you can guess what has happened.  My foil ball got so big that my wife insisted I get it out of the house.  For a while I kept it in the garage, but eventually it got too crowded in there.  Finally I was forced to roll the ball out into the yard, where because of the many nasty children in my neighborhood, I had to chain my ball of foil to a tree.\r\n	Yesterday the ball disappeared!\r\n	True to your careful methods of pure, deductive reasoning, Mr. Holmes, I was able to follow the ball’s progress across the lawn because of the two smashed fences, remnants of a doghouse and a crushed Japanese car left in its wake.  However, I lost its track in the street.\r\n	I have checked with all the metal recycling centers in my neighborhood, to no avail.  Obviously, some fiend has made off with my foil ball for some foul purpose too devious for the decent, ordinary mind to unravel.\r\n	I find this all very upsetting.  I do hope you can find the time to look into this small matter, Mr. Holmes, as I shall be most worried until the whereabouts of my ball of foil is known and the perpetrator of the deed discovered.\r\n	Yours truly,\r\n		Peter Wainwright”\r\n\r\nJust as Downing and Baker are London’s best known streets, so Park Avenue West is the best known street in Mansfield, Ohio, my hometown.  Take 33 seconds and listen to violinist Kenneth Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak playing “Park Avenue West” from my Street Suite for violin and clarinet, which offers brief musical descriptions of ten Mansfield streets.  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nListening to classical music radio stations, we often hear announcements like this:\r\n\r\n	"Today is the birthday of Fafner von Hammerschlag, German expressionist composer born on this date in 1892, best remembered for his tone poem, “Sturm und Drang in einem überfüllten Bus“ which we will now hear performed by the Wieckiwczyc Chamber Orchestra under the direction of Maestro  Hieronymus Siswof-Glompf.”\r\n\r\nHow does the announcer know the birthdays of composers?\r\n\r\nWhen I was a twenty-something broadcaster of classical music, we  announcers consulted a bulky almanac that listed the consequential events that happened on every date of the year, including the birthdays of significant musical figures.\r\n\r\nThumbing through this tome, I was curious to discover which notable musical figures shared my birthday. \r\n\r\nI was born "on a night of high wind and wild portent” (quoting James Thurber), the 16th of January, 1950.  \r\n\r\nI was chagrined to discover that the date of my birthday was designated as "National Nothing Day" by columnist Harold Pullman Coffin and has been observed annually since 1973, when it was added to Chase''s Calendar of Events. \r\n\r\nThe stated purpose of National Nothing Day is:\r\n\r\n	“...to provide Americans with one National day when they can just sit without celebrating, observing or honoring anything."\r\n\r\nUndaunted, I found my way in the almanac to the subcategory of music and musicians.  Finding the right page and column took some doing.  My heart raced!  What great musical figure shared my birthday?  Who would it be?  \r\n\r\nI knew that Beethoven''s birthday was in December, so he was definitely out.  And I knew that Brahms and Tchaikovsky, by an odd coincidence, share the birthdate of March 15, one of those bits of trivia I somehow retain.  \r\n\r\nBut there were plenty of other promising candidates.  Puccini.  Sibelius.  Vaughan Williams.  Ives.  Copland.  Barber.  I’d be proud to share a birthday with any of those guys.\r\n\r\nAh!  At last!  Here it was!  I peered to read the tiny print ... and found that the only musical figure listed as having been born on January 16 was .....   \r\n\r\n				ETHEL MERMAN!\r\n\r\n(brassy musical background, over which we hear that uniquely brassy voice)\r\n\r\n	"There''s NO pee-pul like SHOW pee-pul, they SMAHL when they are BLUUUUUUUE!"\r\n\r\nNothing against Ethel.  I give her her due.  Great in her way.  Still.\r\n\r\nAs for place of birth, I share Mansfield, Ohio with Louis Bromfield (1896-1956), author, conservationist and winner of the Pulitzer Prize.  His best work is probably his home, Malabar Farm, now a much-loved Ohio state park.\r\n\r\nBromfield''s novel “The Green Bay Tree” takes place in Mansfield,  our hometown, Louie''s and mine.  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, my “Street Suite” depicts ten Mansfield streets.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Kenneth Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak playing “Pinecrest Drive” from that suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a dry little factoid with potentially hilarious consequences:  “T” is the second-most frequently used letter of the alphabet in our English/American language.\r\n\r\nHarmless trivia, think you?  Think again, friend, think again!\r\n\r\nFor decades the letters on the marquee of the Ohio Theatre on Park Avenue West, the busiest street in my hometown of Mansfield Ohio, informed pedestrians, drivers and riders as to what films were being shown.\r\n\r\nThe theatre opened in 1925, a splendiferous Grand Baroque movie palace with a fancy marquee touting names of stars and titles of films.  Charlie Chaplin in “The Gold Rush.”  Later, John Wayne in “Stagecoach.”  Later still, “Gone With the Wind,” “Singin’ in the Rain” and “High Noon.”\r\n\r\nBy the time I came along, the theatre’s grandeur had faded.  The seats were worn, the floors were sticky, the restrooms stunk, the marquee was rusty.  Still, it was at “the Ohio” that I saw some great movies:  “The Ten Commandments,” “The Magnificent Seven,” and “The Bridge on the River Kwai.”\r\n\r\nThe chain that owned the theatre spent little on its upkeep.  When the once-classy marquee rusted to the point of becoming a hazard, it was  replaced with a big, cheap, white, plastic rectangle to which dark red, translucent plastic letters were hooked.  These cheesy marquees are still seen, here and there, sometimes spelling the single, sad word, “CLOSED,” on the marquee of a theatre ‘gone dark.’\r\n\r\nWhen Mansfielders abandoned downtown retailers in favor of those at the new shopping malls opening in the suburbs, the old “Ohio” could not compete with the multiplex cinemas.  The chain rented the theatre to an unsavory local who, to the horror of many Mansfielders, tried to make a go of it by screening X-rated films.  \r\n\r\nHe sent the janitor up the ladder out front of the theatre with orders to affix the battered letters so as to spell out the shameless titles of the films.\r\n\r\nWhen the films did not attract enough ticket-buyers to turn a profit, the entrepreneur offered X-rated videos for sale at the concession stand where wholesome popcorn had been peddled to generations of movie-goers.  \r\n\r\nIt was a low moment for Mansfield.  There was worse to come.\r\n\r\nTo apprise the public as to what was available for purchase inside, the following announcement was blazoned on the cheap, weather-battered marquee:\r\n\r\n			EROTIC TAPES \r\n			IN THE LOBBY\r\n\r\nThis was bad, very bad.  The worst was yet to come.\r\n\r\nSince the letter “T” is so often used in English, the supply of that letter had taken more than its share of beatings over the years.  Snow, ice, rain and wind had done their work.  Many of the plastic letters had fallen and broken on the sidewalk below, been repaired with glue and duct tape and returned to service on the marquee.  The “T”s were in particularly bad shape.\r\n\r\nGod has a sense of humor.  The wind removed one of the “T”s, so that, for several days, passersby on Park Avenue West were treated to this announcement:\r\n\r\n		EROTIC   APES	\r\n		IN THE LOBBY\r\n\r\nWith that, Mansfield had reached its nadir, could sink no lower, had bottomed out.\r\n\r\nNot long after, the theatre ‘went dark’ and sat unused for a year before the non-profit corporation I led reopened and restored it, eventually returning the “Ohio” to its former glory, with a new name, “The Renaissance Theatre.”  And a new marquee.\r\n\r\nThe theatre is going strong to this day.\r\n\r\nPark Avenue West is featured in my “Street Suite” of miniatures for violin and clarinet, depicting ten Mansfield streets.  The music I devised for Park Avenue West is not particularly funny.  Since the vignette I shared above seems funny to me, I’d like to share instead the music I wrote for “Davis Road”, a very brief parody of the minuets Haydn and Mozart once wrote.  A mere sliver of music, an aural nail clipping, 23 seconds long.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Ken Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak playing Davis Road from "Street Suite,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hey, I’ve got an idea!  Let’s —— “\r\n\r\nYou’ve said that.  Everyone has.  We all have ideas.\r\n\r\nWhat is it, then, with people who sigh and say, “Oh, I’m just not creative.”\r\n\r\nOf course they are creative.  They have ideas, like everyone else, right?\r\n\r\nWhat they mean is that they don’t write novels or paint paintings of compose symphonies.  They forget that “having an idea” is ubiquitous among humans;  some of us have ideas for novels, paintings and symphonies while others have ideas for other sorts of things.  The thrill of a sudden inspiration comes to us all.\r\n\r\nI remember when I had the idea that grew into the little piece I want to share today.  I was fooling around at the piano and I played a note, then another note a fifth above the first note.  Then I dropped a third and then, from there, went up another perfect fifth.  A pattern!   I dropped another third, went up another fifth, etc.  And when I did that a couple of times, with all of the notes staccato, I felt that I had gone as far up as I wanted to go so I just HELD that last note. \r\n\r\nI played it again.  It pleased me.  It felt good, the way a good idea does.\r\n\r\nThen I thought, “What if a clarinet was playing the up-a-fifth, down-a-third, up-a-fifth pattern and a violin entered on the highest note of the pattern?”  Cool!\r\n\r\nListen to the opening of todays’ piece and you’ll hear what this little idea sounds like.  Follow the score.  You’ll see how the little idea is repeated with a twist, etc.  The piece grew from there.  \r\n\r\nThe above description is all well and good, maybe a little technical-sounding for some.  Composers are in love with music theory; they are fascinated by it.  For most people, music theory is a topic that makes their eyes glaze over.  They eagerly change the subject.\r\n\r\nWhat people want to know from a composer is:  “How does it feel  to invent music?”\r\n\r\nPleasing, intriguing, exciting.  But wait, there’s more.\r\n\r\nWhen I did the work of composing, I felt keenly alert to what the music itself seemed to want to do, where the tune and harmonies seemed to want to go.  I felt keenly alive.\r\n\r\nBut alertness is not an emotion.  I felt a welter of emotions.  \r\n\r\nA shudder of fear, because I was afraid I would compromise and blow it, that the actual work would fall far short of what I hoped it might be (it often did).  \r\n\r\nA swelling of pride, yes, because if I hadn’t believed that I was writing a GREAT WORK, I would not have been able to muster the oomph to follow through and get it down on paper or, later, notated on a computer screen.\r\n\r\nA wash of humility, simultaneously with pride, because I felt that something greater than my little self was passing through my mind and fingertips to the notated score.  What had I ever done to deserve to be on the receiving end of such a good idea?\r\n\r\nI included the little piece in my “Street Suite,” naming it Glenwood Boulevard, a graceful, sleepy street in my hometown of Mansfield, OH.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Ken Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak playing Glenwood Boulevard from "Street Suite,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m hittin’ the bike trail.  Back in an hour.”\r\n\r\n“You’re really going to wear that hat, then?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“And why, exactly?”\r\n\r\n“Because it will be fun.”\r\n\r\nMy wife and daughter hold that, when riding a bicycle, one ought to wear a bicycle helmet.  I usually do, even though it makes me look like a Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtle.  Or a Slovenian tank commander.\r\n\r\nI wish someone would design a bicycle helmet that a gentleman could wear with dignity.  If there was a bicycle helmet in, say, the shape and style of Robin Hood’s green cap or a Three Musketeers’ hat with a big white feather in the headband or Teddy Roosevelt’s hat with the brim pinned up on one side or Lord Baden-Powell’s ‘lemon juicer’ … the chapeau of a gallant cavalier.\r\n\r\nI am the proud owner of a really fine wizard’s hat.  Made of stiff gray cloth, it rises crookedly to a point about two feet above the crown of my head and has a very wide circular brim.  I resolved to wear this hat while riding the bike trail.  Sometimes I like to be a little larger than life, cut a figure, stand out.\r\n\r\nIf I truly wanted to look like a wizard, I could bring along my hiking staff and wear my late mother-in-law’s teal-blue tunic that hangs from my shoulders down to my knees.  These and my wizard’s hat comprise my Halloween costume at the school where I teach.  But it’s cumbersome to ride a bicycle while carrying a staff and I was afraid that the tunic might get snared in the bicycle chain, bring me to an abrupt stop and fling me forward over the handlebars, confirming the efficacy of wearing a proper helmet.   \r\n\r\nThese days I’m particularly qualified to wear a wizard’s hat because I am stricken in years and sport a rather long white beard, a feature I share with the likes of ‘Walt’ Whitman, ‘Hank’ Longfellow and ‘Lenny’ Da Vinci.  Three good men and true.  Mind you, my beard is not half so long as the ones those guys propagated.  Still, having ‘sheltered in place’ for three months, mine has grown pretty long.\r\n\r\nThe other cyclists on the trail would not see me and if they did they would ignore me.  Most tend to be pretty intense.  Most costume themselves as if it was the Tour de France, not just Newtown to Terrace Park.  Brightly colored, skin-tight outfits, blazoned with product names, stylized helmets, fancy gloves, fancy shoes, even sound systems to play music while biking.  Such are the accoutrements, we are to understand, that announce the serious bikesman.  They would have us know that they have spent much.  A bicycle with tires hardly wider than my thumb costs a small fortune.   I paid $300 for my bike 30 years ago.  The tires are thick as my wrist.  I am unnoticed by the big-spenders with whom I share the trail.\r\n\r\nHowever, many pedestrians and joggers use the trail.  Seeing me coming, those folks would smile and wave, perhaps calling out, “Hey there, Gandalf!” \r\n\r\nI tried to think how I might reply.  I could shout, “YOU SHALL NOT PASS!“ which is what Gandalf shouted at the Balrog.  Or, “Fly, you fools!”, Gandalf’s last command to the Fellowship before the Balrog got the better of him.   \r\n\r\nBut what if the pedestrian / jogger had not read “The Lord of the Rings” nor seen the movie?  What if they didn’t get the reference?  How might they feel about a bearded man so be-hatted telling them, on a public bike trail, that they shall not pass?  Or terming them fools who should fly?\r\n\r\nSuch were my thoughts as I rolled down the trail.  Presently, I saw a woman and her little daughter heading my way.  An audience!  The first of the faithful!  \r\n\r\nThe little girl said, “Look, Mama.  It’s Santa Claus.”\r\n\r\nSanta Claus?  Really, kid?  S.C. wears red-and-white.  I was wearing my khaki shorts, my green Mesa Verde Nat’l Park t-shirt and my gray wizard’s hat.  How could I be mistaken for Santa Claus?  Whatever.\r\n\r\nAs I made my way down the trail, many grinned at me but offered no comment.\r\n\r\nThen a group of adolescent boys came into view.  They were trotting toward me, kicking a soccer ball along the trail.  Boys of that age can be a tough audience.  One yelled out, “Hey, guys!  It’s Grandpa Smurf!” which I thought mean.  \r\n\r\nI sniffed and cycled on with a certain hauteur, pretending not to have heard.  \r\n\r\nA wizard’s hat lacks a chin strap.  I had to bicycle slowly so that the breeze didn’t blow the hat off my head.  Nothing more clearly reveals the inherent comedy of existence than the spectacle of a man of a certain age chasing down the street (or bike trail) a hat which the wind has blown off his head.  At such moments, one is made to know what it is to be nakedly on display as a hapless fool, what Lear felt on the storm-struck heath.\r\n\r\nDespite my slow clip, the wind kept pushing the front of the circular brim of my hat up and across my forehead.  It was not the look I intended.  I overheard an older couple as I slowly approached them from the opposite direction.  “Margaret!” said the man, pointing.  “I’ll be ding-busted if it ain’t Gabby Hayes!  an’ here I wuz, thinkin’ he was daid.”  \r\n\r\nAfter that I pulled over, took off my hat and stowed it in my wire basket along side my water bottle.  \r\n\r\nWhen I got home, Jo asked, “How did your hat go over?”\r\n\r\n“OK,” I said, without enthusiasm.  “I guess one time will be enough.”  \r\n\r\n“Well, you had your fun.  Now you can go back to wearing a helmet like anyone who has any sense.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear.  It must be wearying, to be right all the time.”\r\n\r\nShe shrugged.  “Not really,” was her reply.  \r\n\r\nTo hear "Woodhill Road" (a street where I used to ride my bicycle when I was growing up in Mansfield Ohio, often while wearing a bright green plastic Robin Hood cap I cherished in those days) from my “Street Suite,” played by violinist Ken Goldsmith and clarinetist Craig Olzenak, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),69);

We’ve attended almost every year since 1973 and it never fails to move us to tears.\r\n\r\nSome things are beyond the power of words to express.  I remember thinking, when we were on the island of Kauai, “How will I ever convey the beauty of this place to the folks back in Ohio?”  We can only recount the bare facts of the experience and attach a label to our emotional response.\r\n\r\nThe Boar’s Head Festival is like that.  The facts are:  150 volunteer performers in gorgeous costumes, carrying lovingly crafted props, present a Christmas pageant with the  accompaniment of a large chorus and full orchestra.  The SRO crowd adds their voices to those of the choir as familiar carols alternate with solos sung by the ‘stars’ of the cast.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Revels opens with the majestic “Boar’s Head Carol,” enjoining the attendees to sing along with the chorus.  It’s a joyful tune with joyful words, yet I weep all through it, as I do pretty much throughout the whole pageant.\r\n\r\nHow shall I label our emotional response?  What is it, exactly, that moves us so powerfully?\r\n\r\nThe Boar’s Head Festival demonstrates what humanity can achieve when we are at our best.  Responding to the beauty of it, the humor, the majesty, the heartfelt reverence, cast and audience alike are brought to an awareness of our common humanity.  We feel that, despite all the hideousness, the cruelty, the greed, the terror we humans inflict, there is something wonderful about us after all, something that redeems us.\r\n\r\nWhy is this moving?  We are each profoundly different from the rest.  We arrive at every present moment by way of distinct and separate paths, long and winding paths that have led us all through deep shadows and sunny glens.  It is miraculous that we can communicate with one another at all.\r\n\r\nWhen, as part of an audience, we are moved by a shared experience, the awareness of our differences seems to drop away for a little while, our solitude is relieved.  The tears we weep are tears of joy, relief and solace.\r\n\r\nMy little set of variations on The Boar’s Head Carol is a light and humble work, scored for just three musicians.  It falls far short of the splendor of the Boar’s Head Festival that inspired it.  Yet it is my sincere homage to the good people of Christ Church Cathedral, my expression of gratitude for the joy they have brought their audiences every Christmas since 1940.\r\n\r\nThis seems an appropriate moment to quote the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.  He said, “There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers.”\r\n\r\nPlease accept this piece as my sincere attempt to bring you joy.\r\n\r\nTo hear Variations on The Boar’s Head Carol splendidly performed by the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 20, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),159);

But I’d say a composer''s hardest row to hoe is the writing of a hymn.\r\n\r\nA hymn must be short.   Easy to learn and easy to sing.  The tune daresn’t reach too high, nor fall too low.  Rhythms and harmonies must be simple.  The words must suit the tune and the meaning of the words must suit the theology of the congregation who will be expected to sing it.  \r\n\r\nThe tune must be simple, yes, but it must also be sufficiently catchy to withstand unvaried repetition as several verses are sung.  Who wants to sing a dreary tune three times, four times, five times? … “Lemme outta here!"\r\n\r\nI’ve written about fifteen hymns and most of them still need work.  One of the least flawed is “We Begin Again” with stirring words by my poet friend W.B. “Bucky” Ignatius.\r\n\r\nI’m including below a link to a PDF of the hymn if you’d like to see Bucky’s words but the music I want to share today is a set of variations on the hymn’s tune, comprising the second movement of my Trio #5 for clarinet, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you’ll hear is the piano playing the “skeleton” of the tune.  Just the bare bones, but with a twist at the end:  a descending, four-note “Blues-y” figure closes the tune each time.  I had fun figuring out ways to alter that Blues-y touch at the end of each variation.  You’ll have fun listening for it.\r\n\r\nEach variation fleshes out the skeletal structure of the tune in a different way until the last variation when the piano finally delivers the hymn “in all its glory" while the clarinet soars above and the cello elaborates the bass.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement played by clarinetist Laurel Bennet, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander, (the musicians who recorded it on my CD “Winds of May”) click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score for the clarinet / cello / piano version, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the hymn version, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJan. 3, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),160);

The road rises, then very considerately levels off, then rises again, then goes level again.  A thoughtful road, a humane road, a civilized road!   \r\n\r\nAt length the slow climb is rewarded with a long, leisurely descent through lovely Macedonia Brook State Park.  Dense pine forests, a wealth of ferns, quaint little log bridges across the brook, campers happily rustling up breakfast, an occasional whiff of frying bacon on the breeze.  Paradise!\r\n\r\nIt was my first ride wearing my new helmet.  Black with gray trim, very handsome, contrasting quite nicely, I’ve been told, with my white beard and mustache.  I always wear black shorts when I bike.  Usually I wear dark purple woolen socks, but those were wet in the washer so I had put on my black socks.  As it happened, I had pulled on a black t-shirt.  \r\n\r\nAs I crossed the Housatonic, I suddenly realized that I was all in black.  Like Zorro.  Like hunky young Marlon Brando in his motorcycle jacket.  Like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in "Men in Black.”  Like “V,” the shadowy opponent of oppression in “V for Vendetta."\r\n\r\nCool.  Who would I be?  “The Black Bikesman.”  That’s who!\r\n\r\nThus, it was with a ‘certain air of savoir faire’ that I pulled into Kent, pleasantly conscious that I "cut a figure."  Not only was I lookin’ good, but I had just completed a vigorous, healthful ride of about 17 miles over the mountain, a stunt not every 60-something can pull off.\r\n\r\nFather’s Day.  With my kids far away, my daughter in Washington DC, my son back in Cincinnati, I decided to treat myself.   I locked my bike to a tree and made for the nearest sidewalk cafe, crowded with interesting-looking people, New Yorkers weekending in Connecticut.  After a bit, I secured coffee and a raisin-oatmeal cookie.  As I exited through the crowd, a young man said, "Excuse me, sir.  I thought you might like to know that your t-shirt is inside-out."\r\n\r\nI thanked him, though I would have preferred to have remained ignorant.  I chose a chair among the sidewalk tables that would allow me to sit with my back to the wall, hoping no one else would notice the big white t-shirt tag on the nape of my neck.  I dunked my cookie and drank my coffee, my enjoyment somewhat compromised.\r\n\r\nFinally, I got up, tossed my paper cup in the trashcan and hit the sidewalks.  I felt the eyes of my fellow pedestrians behind me.  “Pathetic old guy,” they’d be thinking.  “Can’t even put on his t-shirt correctly anymore.”  \r\n\r\nI had to get my t-shirt right-side-out.  The question was where to do it.  I didn''t want to strip off my t-shirt and present myself bare-chested, however briefly, on a crowded sidewalk.  Connecticut was settled by Puritans and their influence lingers yet in the state’s “Blue Laws.”  For all I knew, going shirtless on a public sidewalk in Connecticut could be a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThere are many shops in Kent, mostly in houses that were formerly homes.  I made my way to the backyard of one of these and went behind a big, old maple tree.  I looked around, to be sure that I was unobserved.  That was when I noticed a woman staring at me from inside.  She rapped her knuckles on the window, wagging her forefinger, shaking her head, frowning.   She had obviously formed the notion that I was about to relieve myself on her tree.\r\n\r\nAt a loss as to how to convey to her my actual intention by pantomiming, I returned to the sidewalk, trying to think what to do.\r\n\r\nI went into a classy dress shop and asked if I could use a dressing room.  "I just need to take off my shirt and then put it right back on," I explained to the clerk.  This gave her pause.  It must have come across as a facile fib, cloaking darker intentions.  She gave me a long look and then said that dressing rooms were for customers only and directed me to the public restrooms, several blocks away.\r\n\r\nI headed that direction.  The sidewalks were crowded with families, couples young and old, attractive women of all ages and many men, all of whom had managed to don their t-shirts right side out.  I could imagine a young mother observing me closely from behind and telling her children, "This is why you must be alert, pay attention and do well in school -- so that, when you are old, you don''t end up walking around in public with your t-shirt inside out." \r\n\r\nWhen I got to the public restroom, there was another man in there, standing, making appropriate use of the facility.  Somehow I didn''t want to take off my shirt while he was there.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had no other reason for being in the restroom and it is not a place for lingering.  So, just to be doing something, I washed my hands.  Soon, he was at the sink next to mine, washing his hands, too.  “Your t-shirt’s inside-out," he observed.  \r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," I said.  "That''s the way they''re wearing them now.  It''s like wearing your base-ball cap backwards.  It makes a statement."\r\n\r\nI caught his face at an angle, in the mirror.  He rolled his eyes, sighed, and left without another word.  \r\n\r\nFinally alone and out of sight of my public, I quickly yanked my t-shirt off, turned it right-side-out and pulled it back on.\r\n\r\nMy confidence regained, I went outside.  \r\n\r\nThe Black Bikesman was back.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer play the second movement from my Father’s Day Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 19, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I sent you an email featuring an unusually dark and grim piece of mine, "The Song of the Marsh."\r\n\r\nI hesitated to share it because my predominant impulse is to purvey sweetness and light, to be a reliable fount of good cheer, "enchanting one and all with my bright smile and merry sallies,” as Bertie Wooster puts it.\r\n\r\nThat’s why these Sunday morning emails have mostly offered selections of my music which are sunny and pert, gay and bobbish, suggestive of a world in which everything is okey-doke, hunkum-bunkum, even boompsa-daisy.  \r\n\r\nWho wants to hear music, I said to myself, that evokes desolation and despair?  and on a Sunday morning, yet?  Aren''t the inherent tragedies of life and the dreary drumbeat of the daily news sufficiently difficult to bear without sorrowful music, yet?\r\n\r\nWell, I may have been wrong.  In fact, I may have got it exactly backwards.  Could it be that sad music is sometimes exactly what helps us bear up?  “We have art,” someone said, “so that we do not perish from the truth.”  Give us, sometimes, a sad song so that we do not perish from sadness.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, on the Sunday morning after I had finally made bold to send out my "Song of Marsh," a good friend approached me at church to tell me how much it had meant to him to discover a darker side in my work.  He shared, “I’m pretty dark, you know … I don’t need  everything perky all the time … in fact, I love melancholy music.”\r\n\r\nHere’s a secret:  I do, too!\r\n\r\nListen to my suites and you’ll often find a dark movement tucked in amongst a high-kickin’ chorus line of happy movements, flanking their dark sister on either side.  \r\n\r\nWhat’s that dark mugwump movement doing in a such company?  you might ask.\r\n\r\nRemember when we studied Shakespeare in High School English class?  We were taught that Shakespeare inserted the gravedigger into “Hamlet” and the gatekeeper into “MacBeth” so that the audience would have some “comic relief.”  \r\n\r\nWell, I think of my occasional, isolated, mugwump movements as “tragic relief” from the jollity surrounding them.\r\n\r\nThree of the four movements of my Father’s Day Suite are ''happy as a clam,'' but today I want to share the third movement, a mournful fugue, my humble attempt to emulate the pathos and depth of feeling we find in parts of Beethoven’s probing late quartets.\r\n\r\nTo hear it beautifully played by violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash \r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 18, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nA monument graces our garden.  It does not memorialize a soldier, a leader or a beloved pet.  It does not commemorate an event.  It does not metaphorize a virtue.  It honors something rarer and thus more precious than any of those entities.   \r\n\r\nIt honors ... the Inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIt is a hunk of rock-like matter, alternately smooth and rough, about two-and-a-half feet in width and height, weighing perhaps a hundred pounds.   It has holes, a dozen or so, of various widths and depths, seemingly drilled into its surface, except that there are no traces of a sharp tool having been used.  What renders it strikingly beautiful is its color: a bright, almost turquoise blue, artfully marbleized with streaks of creamy white.\r\n\r\nWhen something is inexplicable it is important.  Ask Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n“It is of the greatest importance,” the great detective explains when presented with the problem of Lord Baskerville’s missing boot, “because it is inexplicable.”  \r\n\r\nI remember very well when and where I found it.  As to its origin, I am ignorant.  I have shown it to many people and few have been able to venture so much as a guess as to what it might be or how it came to be located where I found it.\r\n\r\nI came upon it deep, deep in the woods of north central Ohio, in Richland County, the region where I passed the first half of my life.  I often wandered the woods there, sometimes for many hours, following faint deer paths, exploring glens, creeks, rock formations, even a few shallow caves.  \r\n\r\nSuddenly, there it was, plop on the forest floor, at least two tenths of a mile from the nearest road.  The surrounding forest was dense.  How had it come to be there?  Carrying it to that location from the nearest road would have been a Herculean task.  I could lift it, just barely.  I could not have walked, carrying it, for more than a dozen yards.  \r\n\r\nIf someone had transported it from the road and set it down there, then why?  Why would anyone go to such a lot of trouble, effort and strain to place a very strange rock-like object deep in a pathless wood?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was dropped from the sky.  But why lug such a thing on board an airplane and then push it out the hatch at the precise moment when it would land in the middle of the least populated part of Jefferson Township?  Was it evidence someone tried to hide?  If so, then why not drop it in a farm pond or in the Clear Fork Reservoir?\r\n\r\nDid it drop from outer space?  I’ve seen a few meteors in Natural History musems; it looks nothing like a meteor, nor like any of the specimens on display in the museums’ halls of gems and minerals.\r\n\r\nOne visitor thought it might be some kind of slag, a by-product, a scabrous remnant from the manufacture of exquisite glass.  But there are no glass works in Richland County and never have been.\r\n\r\nThe inexplicable is common enough in Twilight Zone episodes but a rarity in the humdrum of daily life.  Virtually every object in the little bubbles we inhabit has a back story, an explanation, long known to us, for being what and where it is.  \r\n\r\nNot this.  I had to possess it.  \r\n\r\nEven with the help of a friend and a two-wheel trolley, carting it out of the woods was a devil of a job.  The lay of the land was uneven at best and multiple ravines criss-crossed our route back to my car, parked alongside the nearest yet distant road.   \r\n\r\nWe oomphed it into the trunk.  It was so heavy that the back of the car sagged low and I had to drive home very slowly for fear of scraping the vehicle’s underside on the pot-holed gravel road.  We placed it among the daffodils in the backyard of our home in Bellville.  When we moved to Gambier and later to Cincinnati, the baffled movers lugged it onto the moving van.  \r\n\r\nNow, in what will most likely be our last home, it graces yet another garden, this  monument to the Inexplicable.\r\n\r\nWhy do I tell you this?  The reason is inexplicable, having nothing to do with the music I hope to share today.  It’s Father’s Day, so take my sharing of this story for what it is, the whim of an elderly father, well stricken in years, his mind now engaged in tracing backward the track of an eventful life, apparently oblivious of the present, though still in full vigor. \r\n\r\nTo hear three fine Cincinnati musicians -- violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer -- play the second movement, titled “Sicilienne,” from my Father’s Day Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have no experience dealing with ten-year-old boys.”\r\n\r\nSo said my son, who is dating a single mom who has a ten-year-old son named Eliot.\r\n\r\n“Any tips?”\r\n\r\nThere are few things an old man likes more than to be asked for advice!  \r\n\r\nAs it happens, I know a thing or two about dealing with boys.  I learned them first hand while an adult Scout leader in my thirties and a teacher in my sixties.\r\n\r\nPertaining tangentially to my “Father’s Day Suite,” the finale of which I hope you’ll let me share today, the advice I offered my son is rendered below.\r\n\r\n	“Boys crave and absolutely must find affirmation from an older man who is outside their family.  Without it, they are lost.  \r\n\r\n	“Even the most loving dad cannot give them this affirmation.  The boy enjoys the affirmation of his father but, being immature, he dismisses it because he believes that his father is “just saying that because he has to, seeing as how he is my father.”\r\n\r\n	“Denied the affirmation of an older, unrelated man, boys will seek it from one another.  This is the basis of criminal gangs as well as healthy sports.  But boys cannot grant this affirmation to one another.  Being affirmed by your peers doesn’t mean the same thing.\r\n\r\n	“I was affirmed by Mr. Culp, my Scoutmaster, and by two music teachers, Mr. Evans and Mr. Dunlap.  It was largely because of their affirmations that I became a composer.  In five years of college, only one professor affirmed me.  Thus, as a boy and young man, I was affirmed by just four men outside my family.  It was enough.  More than enough.  Even just one affirmation will meet the need and never be forgotten.\r\n\r\n	“The quest for and the finding of affirmation from a male non-relative is often recounted in literature and film.  \r\n\r\n	“Consider “Treasure Island.”  A mysterious map, doubloons in a buried chest, sea travel, exotic islands, mutiny, pistol waving, yes, but the core of the tale is the friendship of Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver.  \r\n\r\n	“Silver is no saint.  The affirming older man does not have to be a paragon of virtue.  Silver is a villain, shameless, conniving, even murderous.  Nevertheless, Jim loves him and we love him, too, precisely because he gives Jim precisely the affirmation he needs.\r\n\r\n	“It’s simple stuff.  Silver uses Jim’s name frequently and easily.  He listens to Jim, thereby assuring Jim that his thoughts and ideas have value, are worth listening to.  He tells Jim that Jim reminds him of himself when he was young.  He laughs and smiles with Jim; they laugh together, like men.  Silver speaks to Jim as an equal, a mature show of respect that is rare and precious because it is not often afforded a person with only ten years under his belt.\r\n\r\n	“Silver sometimes calls Jim “shipmate” or “Lad” or even “Mr. Hawkins.”  \r\n\r\n	“I suggest that, every now and then, you call Eliot “Sir.”\r\n\r\n	“Say:  “So, tell me, sir, whatcha been up to you lately?” or “Sir!  Tell me what you’re thinking.” or “Sir!  What do you think of this?”  The ‘this’ can be anything, doesn’t matter what.  And it doesn’t matter how Eliot replies.  What matters is that you asked his opinion, called him ‘sir’ and listened to his reply.\r\n\r\n	“He’ll know that you’re half-joking when you him them “Sir,” but he’ll like it. \r\n\r\n	“There are many other examples.  Consider how Gandalf treats Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.  He uses their names often; he listens to them; he respects their questions and never ‘sugar-coats’ his answers\r\n\r\n	“Consider Obi Wan’s treatment of Luke Skywalker.\r\n\r\n	“Consider Mr. Miyagi and Daniel in “The Karate Kid.”\r\n\r\n	“Consider Lt. Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) and Charlie Simms (Chris O’Donnell) in “Scent of a Woman,” a film I love.\r\n\r\n	“Lucky D’Artagnan!  He finds three affirmers:  Porthos, Athos and Aramis … The Three Musketeers..\r\n\r\n	“You only have to remind yourself to do it.  When there are other adults around, like Eliot’s mom, it’s easy to be so interested in her that Eliot is made to feel invisible.  Be especially alert at such moments.  When he is present, center your attention on him.  His mom can wait.\r\n\r\n	“One other observation:  young people seek The Authentic.  They detest anything they perceive to be insincere, smarmy, slick, fake, packaged, ingratiating.  Holden Caulfield despises “a phony.”  \r\n\r\n	“They are intensely drawn to what they perceive to be REAL and TRUE.  They eagerly scan an enormous range of information — songs, video games, films, books, the whole of pop culture and everyone in their immediate vicinity -- in search of Something Authentic.\r\n\r\n	“They regard we elders through that prism, asking themselves, “Is this person authentic?”  Be real.  Give only sincere compliments.  Talk about things that genuinely interest or amuse you.  Say and do things that arise from your true self.  Eliot will be watching.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the advice I offered my son.  You already knew all of it, right?\r\n\r\nYou also already know the tune out of which the main theme of the finale of my Father’s Day Suite grew.  It’s the catchy musical logo that begins NPR’s “All Things Considered.”  Modified rhythmically, the NPR fragment comprises only the opening phrase; the rest of the tune is original.  \r\n\r\nIf I hadn’t tipped you off, you might not have noticed the NPR-derived fragment, though when Chris Miller overheard the musicians rehearsing this piece at church, he noticed it right away and teased me about it later.  It’s OK.  Having been affirmed in my youth, I can handle it! \r\n\r\nNow you’ll have the fun of listening for it! \r\n\r\n(Picasso said, “...artists steal.”) \r\n\r\nTo hear three fine Cincinnati musicians -- violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer -- play the finale from my Father’s Day Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),38);

Except for the musicians who recorded it and the recording engineer, you will be the first.\r\n\r\nI wrote my Suite for Three Violins in 1989 but it has never been performed.  Two summers ago it was recorded and after a long wait, the editing has been completed and the recording is ready to be heard.  \r\n\r\nEverything happens slowly in the world of classical music.  It can takes years to share a new composition.  By then, the piece is no longer new, strictly speaking.  Still, it’s new to the listeners.\r\n\r\nAfter another long wait, a CD featuring the Suite for Three Violins along with two other chamber works of mine and four by my friend and co-producer of the CD, Mark Louis Lehman, was finally released.  \r\n\r\nThe new CD is entitled Notes from the Midwest:  Seven Chamber Works by Two Cincinnatians. \r\n\r\nIn keeping with my policy of sharing my work, free, to the greatest extent possible, I am  giving away this new CD to friends and fans, near and far.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to hear the second movement from my Suite for Three Violins, played with snap and verve by three superb Cincinnati violinists -- Kris Frankenfeld, Frankie Howard and Elizabeth Steva — and recorded by the great Cincinnati sound engineer John Burgess, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 7, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nYou must have heard it.  When National Public Radio acknowledges the support of the National Endowment for the Arts, the announcement concludes with a terse, no-nonsense assertion:\r\n\r\n	“Art works.”\r\n\r\nWord play on “artworks.”  I get it.  Clever.  \r\n\r\nStill … may I grumble?  \r\n\r\n(As our world slides toward chaos, my grumble is small stuff.  But you might get a smile out of it.  Bear in mind that I’m half-joking….)\r\n\r\nSaying that “art works" seems to imply that art needs to be justified …  that it is somehow effective "after all" ... that it demonstrates competence and productivity, workplace virtues  highly prized in a workaday world.  \r\n\r\nArt, it turns out, has a function!  Art has value.  Why?  Because it works!   \r\n\r\nArt, we are assured, is on the job.  Busy!  Occupied!  \r\n\r\nWho knew?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, announcing that ''art works’ makes that valid claim that art is an industry, an employer of thousands.  \r\n\r\nI remember this when I hear of schools dropping art and music classes on the grounds that such subjects are not career-related.  I want to shout, “What about ME?”  \r\n\r\nThe music classes of my 7th-12th grade years were the foundation of my entire career.  For me, those courses were a crucial preparation.  \r\n\r\nIn the phrase "art works” I also hear the notion that art is somehow an antidote to societal woes, a remedy for sundry public malaises, good medicine for our culture.  Duly noted.  Art can sometimes be a panacea of sorts.\r\n\r\nStill, the phrase has the same slightly defensive tone we hear when someone goes to bat for alternative medicine, “Acupuncture works!”   \r\n\r\nThe phrase implies that, in an ongoing argument about the efficacy of art, our side is losing, that ours is the uphill struggle, the battle against the odds.  Maybe so.  Maybe it’s not enough just to “do” art.  Maybe we must also try to convince whoever is listening that the conventional wisdom about art (that it doesn’t work) is wrong.  The NEA is rallying us, defiantly shouting back:  “But, don’t you see?  It does work!"\r\n\r\nTo my ear, the phrase strikes pre-emptively against the assumption that artists are slackers who expect the rest of us to support them. \r\n\r\nNot so!  But … no wonder there are so many grumpy artists! \r\n\r\nI read about a study some scholar undertook, probing the psyches of The Great Composers.  The scholar read all their letters and diaries and all that was written about them by their acquaintances, in the hope of plumbing the depths of their being.  In plain American, he wanted to get a handle on what kinda guys they were, psychologically-speaking-wise. \r\n\r\nThe scholar discovered that The Great Composers had one trait in common:  irritability.  \r\n\r\nI had to laugh.  I’m sure it’s true.\r\n\r\nBach, Beethoven and Brahms were notoriously grumpy.  Chopin threw a chair at a student.  You didn’t want to get on the wrong side of Wagner.   Charles Ives was a grouch of the first magnitude.  Sibelius, permanently ticked off, composed nothing in the last thirty years of his life.  That showed ‘em.\r\n\r\nWhoa.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that irked them so?  \r\n\r\nSome slob sidled up to them at a party, stood too close, put an unwelcome arm around their shoulders and, puffing beer breath into their face, slurred out the words, … “Lemme tell ya somethin'', old timer.  Art works!"\r\n\r\nHarrumph!\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, you’re invited to listen to the fourth movement of my Suite for Three Violins, beautifully played by three superb Cincinnati violinists -- Kris Frankenfeld, Frankie Howard and Elizabeth Steva — and recorded by the great Cincinnati sound engineer John Burgess.

In the “Waltz” movement, which I want to share with you today, I tried something different.  No folk tunes are quoted; the tunes are my own.  Instead, I attempted to blend a Russian style —  something like Rachmaninoff’s -- with my own American style.\r\n\r\nI admire Rachmaninoff.  He didn’t cave.  When the modernism of Schoenberg and Stravinsky overtook the musical world, he carried forward the banner of Romanticism.  His best music is unabashedly tonal, melodic and ‘from the heart.''\r\n\r\nHe demonstrates that Romanticism is not confined to a particular era.  It is one end of a timeless spectrum; the other end is Classicism.  The ancient Greeks mythologized these opposing artistic impulses as two gods:  Dionysius and Apollo.  Any artwork of any era takes a position on this spectrum.  On one end, the Dionysian/Romantic extreme,  hysteria and chaos reign.  At the opposing Apollonian/Classical extreme, order and an austere calm are imposed.\r\n\r\nRachmaninoff’s best works veer toward the warmer end.  That’s not to say that his work is chaotic or hysterical (he’s not Tchaikovsky).  Rachmaninoff emphasizes passionate feeling and expressivity.\r\n\r\nThe beginning and ending of the little Waltz movement from my “Sunny Days” suite aspire to the warmth of a good tune by Rachmaninoff.  The longer middle section is warm, too, but sounds very American, a gentle Appalachian folk song.  \r\n\r\nAnother duality is in the scoring.  The piano opens the movement alone, then falls silent while the violin and clarinet play together.  The three come together only when the American-sounding music begins.  Then the piano goes silent again while the others play.  Then it’s just clarinet and piano.  Then just violin and clarinet.  Finally the three reunite, the violin strumming guitar-like pizzicatos.  The piano repeats the music of its opening solo, the other instruments finally joining in, closing the movement.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Waltz from Sunny Days played tenderly and beautifully by violinist Paul Patterson, clarinetist Anthony Costa and pianist Phil Amalong, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 11, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA lot of my music is “programmatic,” i.e., more or less about something non-musical.  A season, a place, a personality, an idea, an homage to or parody of another composer or musical genre.\r\n\r\nMusic that is not “programmatic” is called “absolute music,” i.e., not intended to be about anything.  It’s just music; make of it what you will.\r\n\r\nYet, for many people, music -- all music, any music — brings vivid images to mind.  At the reception after a performance of one of my pieces — I forget which piece exactly but it was not a “programmatic” piece -- a lady told me that she had “especially liked the part where the squirrels were playing in the leaves.”  I had no idea what she was talking about but I nodded and said, “Thank you."\r\n\r\nThat was a comical moment for me but I am sure the lady was serious; she was certain her image was accurate and precise and that I would know to which part of the piece she was referring.\r\n\r\nWho is to say, after all?  Once a piece is written, the composer is just another listener; his opinions are not definitive.  For all I know, maybe metaphorical squirrels were at play in that section.\r\n\r\nWhen I hear the third movement from my Suite for Three Violins, an example of “absolute music,” I find myself imagining a long, narrow, brightly-colored, silk pennant rising and falling in a gentle breeze.  \r\n\r\nI suppose I could title it, “Long, Narrow, Brightly-colored, Silk Pennant Rising and Falling in a Gentle Breeze.”  \r\n\r\nSuch a title would have almost as strong a claim as, “Squirrels Playing in the Leaves.”\r\n\r\nMusic sometimes prompts these mysterious mental responses.  \r\n\r\nI wonder what images piece might elicit from you.  Maybe none at all.  Maybe you’ll shrug and say, “It’s just nice music.”   \r\n\r\nThat’s OK, too.\r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement from my Suite for Three Violins, played with snap and verve by three superb Cincinnati violinists -- Kris Frankenfeld, Frankie Howard and Elizabeth Steva — and recorded by the great Cincinnati sound engineer John Burgess, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 15, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nMy composer friend Mark Lehman summed it up:\r\n\r\n	"Always the composer must balance inevitability and surprise: the "givens" of his piece that unify it, and the surprising transformations that make it into a journey worth taking.  And of course the ideas a composer chooses to develop must be somehow appealing and shapely, or striking, pregnant with at least the possibility of emotional charge."\r\n\r\nMarvelous!  Re-read it, carefully.  It describes, precisely and eloquently, the composer’s challenge.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lord in Heaven, WHAT a TALL order!  Bach, Beethoven, Mahler, Sibelius … they live up to it, at least some of the time … and when they do, the effect on mere mortals is so humbling as to be almost stifling.  \r\n\r\nAt this very moment, upon mentioning those august names, I would bare my head …  except that I happen not to be wearing a hat!  \r\n\r\nAfter those guys, what’s the point of writing music?  What could we possibly contribute to the art form they still dominate?\r\n\r\nWhile they pirouette from Himalayan peak to peak, Mark and I know ourselves to be a couple of worms creeping along from clod to clod.  "A pair of ragged claws, scuttling across the floors of silent seas….”\r\n\r\nI wonder if practitioners of the other arts feel the weight of past Masters as heavily as we composers.\r\n\r\nDo contemporary playwrights shrivel at the thought of Shakespeare?  Are the writing hands of living novelists withered by Tolstoy?  Do today’s painters drop their brushes because of Monet?\r\n\r\nPast Masters can squelch the likes of us.  Knowing we’ll never top, equal or approximate what The Great Ones achieved, how shall we muster the gumption to proceed?\r\n\r\nOne way is to steer clear of the genres those masters command.  Modern-day playwrights would be well advised not attempt the writing of five-act verse-dramas in iambic pentameter.  \r\n\r\nContemporary novelists probably ought not to try their hand at the writing of 1500-page-long epic tales of society in crisis, top-to-bottom, displaying the empathy of God Almighty for more than 500 characters therein, from servant girl to aristocrat.  \r\n\r\nMost likely, painters nowadays should petition whatever dieties they acknowledge, asking that they be led not into the temptation of painting water lilies.\r\n\r\nAs for living composers?  Shall they busy themselves writing all-out grand operas?  heroic hour-long piano concertos?  epic symphonies scored for expanded orchestra, chorus, a children’s chorus, off-stage trumpets and an oboist perched in the rear balcony?  \r\n\r\nSome do and I say, "God bless them, every one.”  (Or, as Robert Benchley said, “God help us, every one.”)\r\n\r\nMe?  Writing a suite for three violins, I briefly escaped the long shadows of Beethoven, Sibelius and the rest, insofar as none of those johnnies ever stooped to write a thing so common and simple as a lowly suite for a mere three violins.\r\n\r\nTo hear the first movement from my Suite for Three Violins, played very sweetly by three superb Cincinnati violinists -- Kris Frankenfeld, Frankie Howard and Elizabeth Steva — and recorded by the great Cincinnati sound engineer John Burgess, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAlthough these weekly messages are not written uniquely to you, I try my best to give them the tone of a personal expression, a letter to a good friend.\r\n\r\nI began writing and sending these ‘mpFrees’ (my daughter’s coinage for this curious literary form, a mini-essay about a piece of my music + an mp3 of a performance of the piece + a PDF displaying the score) to about 85 friends.  Namely, everyone in my church choir, some local instrumentalists who have enjoyed playing my works, and a dozen non-musician friends, near and far.  \r\n\r\nAfter 3.5 years, the list of recipients for these ‘mpFrees’ has grown to 635.  Here’s how it happened.  One of you will forward a message to a friend and then that friend will send me an email with “yes” in the subject line, indicating that they want to be a recipient.\r\n\r\nAlso, every time someone emails me about my music — perhaps they heard a piece of mine on the radio and are inquiring about sheet music — I reply with an email describing my ‘mpFrees’ project and offering to include them as a recipient.  Many reply in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nSome of you have kindly suggested that the best of these ‘mpFree’ messages ought to be compiled into a book.  I don’t agree.  A book could not include active links to mp3s and PDFs.  It would be nice if books could do that.  Who knows?  The technology that could equip a book with internet access may be just around the corner.  But until then I could only print the website addresses of the mp3 and PDF; someone was curious to hear the music and see the score would have to type the addresses into the search field of their browser, etc.  Tedious!  Few would bother.\r\n\r\nToo, a book is a very expensive thing to create.  How well I know.  I’ve written and published a half dozen of them.  The only way to recover the investment is to sell the books.  But I don’t want to sell anything to my friends.  No commercialization!  That is my promise to everyone who permits me to share in this way.\r\n\r\nI would like to post all of these mini-essays on a vast on-line resource which anyone could access and to which I could add a new essay every week.  But I don’t know how to do it and the friends who DO know how are so busy with other things that I hate to burden them with this chore.\r\n\r\nSo, for now, I chug along, writing new ‘mpFrees’ weeks in advance, always excited about the one that’s coming soon..\r\n\r\nIn spite of my having invented and mastered this little digital / literary art form, I’m really a bit of a Luddite — I have no cell phone, no Facebook, nothing much in the way of e-this or e-that.  I have a good website but only because a dear friend put the time into developing it, in part so that he could share it with other prospective clients who might hire him to do the same.  Nowadays he has moved on to other things.\r\n\r\nI plan to continue to sending these weekly emails for years and years to come.  \r\n\r\nAfter about fifty more mpFrees, I will have sent out an email which will have featured every recording I have of my music.  What then?  I’ll start over with the musical selections, devising new verbiage to go with them the second time around.  Music stays the same but we change, events change; there are always new things to verbalize.\r\n\r\nWriting these ‘mpFrees’ has become my chief creative activity and I enjoy the work of crafting them.  I think of you, my friends, while I’m writing them, trying to make them into something I fancy y''all would like to read.  I try to offer something that will be worth your attention.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to today’s music:  the Finale from my five-movement Suite for Three Violins.  It’s a beautiful example of ‘the reconciliation of opposites.’  It opens with Violin I playing a rollicking, slightly jazzy tune that zips along like a ‘perpetual motion machine’, with Violin II slipping in before long, joined by Violin III sounding the “G” string, the violin’s lowest note, as a pedal point.\r\n\r\nAt 1:26 comes a big contrast.  The music settles down with a hymn-like tune, the violins ‘singing’ together like a choir.   Several variations on the hymn tune follow.  Listen carefully and you’ll hear the rollicking opening tune gradually ‘invading’ the hymn tune, between phrases.\r\n\r\nAt 3:42 the rollicking opening tune returns in glory.  Now it’s the hymn tune’s turn to invade!  At last the two tunes are reconciled, standing together as equals, and as friends.\r\n\r\nI particularly like the ending.  Two quiet, American-sounding chords, like an “Amen” at the end of an anthem.  The reconciliation is complete!\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement from my Suite for Three Violins, played with all due verve by three superb Cincinnati violinists -- Kris Frankenfeld, Frankie Howard and Elizabeth Steva — and recorded by the great Cincinnati sound engineer John Burgess, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),39);

Americans grow up loving Abraham Lincoln.  We see his strange face in the famous black-and-white photos, looking sad and tired but also kind and faintly humorous.  A homely face, a tall, gawky figure, yet children know that they could climb over his bony knees and curl up in his lap and feel safe and loved.\r\n\r\nLincolnesque is the title of the second of five movements in my "Trio con Brio" for violin, clarinet and cello.  I wrote the work in 1999 for my clarinetist friend Angelo Santoro.  Since Angelo planned to premiere the trio in a concert scheduled for February 12, Abe’s birthday, I decided to write a movement honoring Lincoln.  \r\n\r\nWhat music evokes Mr. Lincoln?  Aaron Copland’s fine work for narrator and orchestra, “A Lincoln Portrait,” effectively portrays the public Lincoln -- the great leader, orator, folk hero.  \r\n\r\nWith only three instruments at my disposal, I tried to write a more intimate portrait, a miniature.  This music is intended to evoke the man of the Prairie, the folksy, lanky, gentle lover of books and teller of stories.  Quiet and a tad wistful.  A simple person, honest and authentic, in whom we sense a capacity for depth.  Good natured.  Patient.  A reconciler.\r\n\r\nI later made a transcription of the work for clarinet and piano.  As with all my music, upon request, I’ll gladly send anyone PDFs of the score and clarinet part.\r\n\r\nTo hear Lincolnesque performed exquisitely by clarinetist Michele Gingras, violinist Kris Frankenfeld and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 14, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA lullaby suits Christmas Eve; we like to imagine Mary administering a musical soporific to the newborn baby Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe "Lullaby” I’m administering to you on this Christmas Eve morning was written for my clarinetist friend, Cynthia Field.  She is the self-proclaimed president of my fan club;  when she emails me, that’s how she signs off.\r\n\r\nCindy asked me to write a lullaby, but not so that she would have a tune handy when and if she might need to croon an infant to sleep.  For that purpose she could easily hum “Rock-a-Bye Baby” and/or Brahms’ immortal contribution to The Lullaby League.\r\n\r\nInstead, Cindy asked me to write a sweetly sad lullaby in honor and memory of her mother, Ellen Lewis Field, whom she had recently lost.\r\n\r\nA lullaby must be somnolent and repetitive; we sing the same little tune over and again until the audience — the tiny person to whom the tune is directed -- finally drifts across the border that separates the wakeful from The Land of Nod.  \r\n\r\nA by-the-book lullaby wouldn''t cut the mustard in a work of chamber music.  Musicians and listeners would quickly tire of a simple tune played over and again with no development or expansion.  This lullaby, the fourth movement of my five-movement “Trio con Brio,” had to offer more than somnolence and repetition if it was to stand proud and tall, with shoulders back and chin held high, alongside its sister movements.\r\n\r\nSo, while the tune itself, played by the violin at the outset of the movement, is definitely a lullaby, it’s misleading to title the movement “Lullaby.”  More accurately, it’s a set of variations on a lullaby-like tune.  \r\n\r\nYet, it would have been even more misleading to name it “Variations on a Lullaby” because that title creates expectations that would not be met by the music I envisioned.  \r\n\r\nA proper set of variations must have a certain structure:  a clear statement of the tune followed by variants of the tune such as a gig version, then maybe a march, a polka, a waltz, at least one variation in a minor key, delivered with flurries of flourishes, doodads by the dozen, musical gewgaws galore.\r\n\r\nWhat I wrote is more like a fantasia.  I might have named it “Fantasia on a Lullaby.”  But that title connotes something else that doesn’t sit right; a fantasia is supposed to offer a mixture of forms and styles tossed off with flash-and-flair.  Flash-and-flair?  Too flamboyant for a lullaby. \r\n\r\nToo, a fantasia is usually a keyboard work.  No keyboard in this trio, just violin, clarinet and cello.   \r\n\r\nNaming the baby is no small trick.  Thought is required.  I wonder how much thought Mary and Joseph gave to the naming of their baby.\r\n\r\nI finally came full circle, titling the movement, simply, and after all, “Lullaby.”  \r\n\r\nTo hear the “Lullabye" from my Trio con Brio performed very tenderly by clarinetist Michele Gingras, violinist Kris Frankenfeld and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWhen we finally, sadly, put Jake to sleep, we agreed:  “No more dogs.”  \r\n\r\nDuring the first forty years of our marriage we owned four dogs, one at a time.  Thurber, Candy, Binsche and Jake. \r\n\r\nFour seemed enough.  Without a dog, we’d be more free to travel, the apartment would be cleaner, quieter.  No more midnight walks in the freezing rain, traversing the steep, icy sidewalks of Cincinnati, yanked along by a barrel-chested canine straining on a leash.  Enough.  All that would recede into the past, eased into memory by the tincture of Time.  \r\n\r\nHowever ... Jo, an ardent, life-long lover and admirer of dogs, a dog enthusiast, a dog guru, sorely missed old Jake.  Suddenly she was bereft of a little furry creature to feed and to fuss over, with whom to converse, for whom to sing funny songs of her own invention.\r\n\r\n''Then one day,'' as storytellers say, a neighbor couple asked if they might leave their dog in our care during a vacation they were planning, even offering to pay for the service.  Jo was thrilled to accept.  No inn guest ever received a warmer welcome nor enjoyed a more satisfying stay than Huxley, a bouncy, brindle boxer.\r\n\r\nWord spread.  Soon, other neighbors were leaving their dogs with us, sometimes just for a few hours, sometimes overnight, sometimes for a weekend or longer.  \r\n\r\nJo discovered an on-line service that links dog parents with dog sitters and soon amassed twice as many rave reviews on their website as any other dog sitter in the Queen City.  Jo saw no reason to limit the number of these shaggy guests to two or three; soon we were hosting four dogs at a time, then five, then six.  \r\n\r\nWe’ve been dog sitting for four years, tallying over 500 dog-stays.   Our guest list includes many colorful and imaginative doggy names, including Bugsy, Bam-bam, Chompers, Zeus, Zola, Elizabeth Taylor, Gizmo, Cosmo, Enzo, Milo and Norbert.  \r\n\r\nRegarding Jo’s latter-day reinvention of herself as a businesswoman, I  quote Sean Connery’ character in "The Man Who Would Be King”:  “She’s more than a wife!  She’s a going concern!”  \r\n\r\nMy attitude toward all this?  Generally positive.  Back in the 1950’s, when Jo was a girl, she wanted to be a veterinarian but in that career was closed to women during that be-nighted era.  (Today female vets outnumber males.)  \r\n\r\nInstead, Jo became a nurse and did important work with the mentally disabled, AIDS patients and Planned Parenthood.  But her heart was with dogs.  \r\n\r\nThus, for Jo, the dog sitting business became a partial fulfillment of her girlhood dream.  She takes a keen interest in every dog''s medical, psychological and social history.  Prospective dog parent-customers must submit a detailed ten-page application.  She carefully screens parents and dogs during a mandatory, hour-long ''meet-and-greet’ session.  She has a knack for sensing which dogs will or won''t ‘play well with others.’ \r\n\r\nCaring for dogs makes Jo happy and that makes me happy.  She conceived and developed a profitable home-business with no up-front investment.  Few can say as much!\r\n\r\nThere’s more.  The care Jo gives extends well beyond the dogs.  Vacations are only one reason why dogs need sitting.  Tragedies, weddings, births, extended illnesses, even jury duty are among the many other reasons people need dog sitters.  As Jo''s rapport with the dogs’ parents quickly deepens, her skills as a listener, counselor, and friend come into play.  Her peculiar vocation has grown into a ministry.  Dogs'' lives are short; when they die, it is Jo with whom the parents share their grief. \r\n\r\nMe, I like dogs just fine but I impose one strict rule:  there shall be no dogs allowed, ever, in my ‘back room,’ a sort of study where I write, read, phone a friend, take a nap, etc.  \r\n\r\nDog sitting is troublous at times.  Dogs have ‘accidents,’ get sick, fight over a bone or a half-empty bowl of food.  Most of the time, they’re good company and fun to have around.  They are always ready to play or just “relate.”  Scratch their ears or their tummies and they are instantly in love with you.\r\n\r\nThey provide free entertainment.  I relish their lengthy, intense tug-of-wars and mock battles, wrestling, rolling, scuffling, tussling, pretending to bite each other’s ears, necks, haunches and tails, growling in feigned ferocity, a boisterous, bogus battle-cry.\r\n\r\nWhy all this about dogs, you’re wondering?  Because the music I want to share with you today reminds me, when I listen to it, of these faux doggy-wars that enliven the Sowash household.  \r\n\r\nThe music is the opening movement of my Trio con Brio.  The movement is named, “Intrada,” nothing to do with dogs.  An Intrada is simply a musical introduction or prelude, usually the opening movement of a suite.  \r\n\r\nThere is irony in this music; it is “angry” in quotation marks, i.e., tongue-in-cheek.   In that respect it resembles a mock battle between dogs with all the rambunctious good humor of a counterfeit canine combat.\r\n\r\nTo hear the “Intrada" from my Trio con Brio exuberantly performed by clarinetist Michele Gingras, violinist Kris Frankenfeld and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s April Fool’s Day, 2020, but this is not the year for pranks.  \r\n\r\nUplift?  Humor?  Yes.  \r\n\r\nYesterday, I resumed teaching at my school -- which has the student-chosen name, ''Leaves of Learning’ -- albeit on-line.  \r\n\r\nIt was good to see the faces and hear the voices of my students, even if only on my computer screen.  We were all a little clumsy with the technology but we were patient with one another and had some laughs.  Some content was imparted and absorbed.\r\n\r\nTeaching on-line is a far cry from teaching in a classroom.  But hearing “a far cry” is far better than hearing no cry at all.  The mother of one of my students enlightened me by saying, “If you feel badly that you can’t give your students 100% of what you would like to give them, then believe me when I tell you that 10% of all that you have to offer is still a whole lot.”\r\n\r\nStudents need content and consistency.  The latter is delivered just by showing up, just by appearing on the screen, on time, with something to offer.  Just that, in itself, may be more valuable at this moment than conjugating a French verb or working through a French short story.\r\n\r\nStill, we miss ’the good old days,’ just three weeks ago, when we hung out together in a classroom, taking it for granted.\r\n\r\nNow, with the help of one of my students, there is a YouTube slide-show that, for three minutes, takes us back to those days.\r\n\r\nYou are also invited to visit my classroom, virtually, by viewing that YouTube.\r\n\r\nMost of the photos in the YouTube were taken by my students.  Whenever I do something eccentric, they get out their cell phones and start clicking.  Later, they share the photos with their friends and sometimes send me a copy.  Only because they are cute and funny, I’ve kept them in a file on my computer.  Now, I’m glad I did because they make an uplifting slide-show to share with you at a time when uplift and humor are in short supply. \r\n\r\nToo, you may feel that you know me a little better after seeing me perform as a teacher.  You may see why I love teaching so much and why I can hardly grasp that I am actually paid to have this much fun and to sew, tend and harvest this much joy.\r\n\r\nI hope the video will help you feel a little more connected.\r\n\r\nThe musical score is the third movement, “Song of Samwise,” from my Trio con Brio,  exuberantly performed by clarinetist Michele Gingras, violinist Kris Frankenfeld and cellist Ellen Shertzer.\r\n\r\nTo view the video, copy and paste this link into your browser:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBe1-1cYlTk&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a great idea that was, to take a nap.”  \r\n\r\nSo says columnist James Parker in a recent issue of The Atlantic:\r\n\r\n	“After lunch, perhaps, nature gently makes the suggestion.  So you settle; you sink.  But not too far.  A delicious shallowness.  You open your eyes.  You’re awake again -- in a state of lamblike innocence, blinking limpidly and contentedly.  Ah, it feels so good.  What a great idea that was, to take a nap.”\r\n\r\nSheltering in place for three full seasons, going on four, I’ve gotten in the habit of napping almost every day.  Sometimes twice a day!\r\n\r\nI have the perfect-est little room for a siesta.  I call it my cubbyhole.  The only room on the tiny second floor of our house, it has sloping ceilings and dormer windows.  A widow’s walk tops the house; the cubbyhole is the little room beneath the widow’s walk.  A narrow stairway ascends from the cubbyhole to a hatch that accesses the widow’s walk.  In warmer weather, I like to go up there to take in the view of the pines at the border of our property, the green sward beyond and the hills on the far side of the valley of the Little Miami River.\r\n\r\nJo decorated the rest of our house -- and a good thing, too; I shudder to think what our home would look like if the decorating had been left to me.  But the cubbyhole is MY space.  I admit it:  it’s a boy’s room.\r\n\r\nMy Eagle badge, 1964 Boy Scout Jamboree neckerchief and the wooden neckerchief slide I carved when I was 12 (it’s a flintlock derringer, a vest-pocket pistol) are in plain sight.  \r\n\r\nThe gems of my collection of hand-painted toy soldiers are parading or standing at attention on display shelves.  There’s an elaborate toy pirate ship with red-and-white striped sails, a jolly roger flag and a crow’s nest, manned by a colorful crew which I painted.  Keeping watch on my desktop are mini-statues of three inspiring eminences:  Gandalf, Babar the Elephant and Teddy Roosevelt.  \r\n\r\nA large Great Seal of the State of Ohio hangs by itself on one narrow wall.   Hung on another wall, alongside family photos is my great-grandfather’s ceremonial Masonic sword (his name is engraved on the blade:  Martin Luther Sowash and I’m not joking).  On the opposite wall are portraits of my heroes:  Charles Ives, Thoreau, Odell Shepard and Binsche, our noble Springer spaniel who, like those other great souls, has gone to his reward.  \r\n\r\nEtchings by my artist friends Randy Wright and Sean Sexton hang alongside three Chagall lithographs and an ink rendering of bamboo branches that was fashioned before my wondering eyes by an artist in Taiwan who inscribed and presented it to me.  A framed drawing of The Green Man represents a healthy paganism, a touch of Nature worship in my otherwise Christian theology.\r\n\r\nMy favorite hiking stick rests in the corner.  A curved dagger made in East India, a Turkish yataghan (I call it my ‘Spaghetti machete’) and my Scout knife are at the ready in case of intruders.  \r\n\r\nThere’s just room for one twin bed.  A Hudson’s Bay blanket brings color, good cheer and a hint of French Canada to the room and offers a delicious warmth when I nap beneath it.  My favorite books respose on a small bookshelf near to hand.  \r\n\r\nOn the nightstand is a diorama of Robin Hood and his Merry Men practicing their archery, quarterstaff and fencing skills in a Sherwood Forest of miniature trees, stumps and rocks, realistically painted by the undersigned.  Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Maid Marion are on hand.  Robin, too, in the center, exuberantly blowing a rallying call on his cow-horn bugle.  There’s a miniature stone bridge and some of the Manly Merriers are crossing it, setting out on an adventure.  \r\n\r\nIn my cubbyhole, I feel very much at home.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about napping there is that upon awakening, eyes half open, head still on the pillow, I can gaze through the windows into the mass of our stately pines, ever green, even in this gray time.  The branches sway gracefully in the wind, gesturing like dancers.  Wordless, they nevertheless convey the assurance that, contrary to the grim daily news, things are as they ought to be.  If these deeply rooted, ancient pines could put their tree-thoughts into words, they would say:  “Underneath are the everlasting arms.”\r\n\r\nTo hear a nap-worthy rendering (I mean that to be a compliment) of the “Lullabye" from my Trio con Brio performed very tenderly by clarinetist Michele Gingras, violinist Kris Frankenfeld and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, at the grocery store, I picked up a can of my favorite baked beans and right there on the label, plain for all to see, it said:  "made with real onions."   \r\n\r\nI’ve enjoyed these beans for years, even cold, straight out of the can, but I had never noticed this.  I considered.  “Bea-ns” how the bean company was announcing this fact, I figured there must be something to it.  “Caveat emptor?”\r\n\r\nThis got me to thinking.  Fake onions must “be a thing” these days.  The bean company alerts buyers to the situation and assures them that matters are in hand.    \r\n\r\nProbably what happened was this:  the bean company’s head ‘bean counter’ discovered that fake onions are a little cheaper.  The bean company’s chef tried them and found that they just weren’t as tasty as real onions.  So the company did the right thing and stuck with the real ones. \r\n\r\nProud of their commitment to real onions, they announced it on the label.  \r\n\r\nI pondered this further.  There must be fake onion farms.  Which means that there must be fake onion farmers and fake onion truck drivers and, obviously, fake onion eaters.  Who are these people?  Do you know any?\r\n\r\nI’m determined to support the cultivation of real onions by continuing to buy, exclusively, beans that are made with them.   I trust you will do the same.\r\n\r\nI hope that, by sharing these insights, I haven’t opened a whole new can of worms.  Or should I say “real worms?”\r\n\r\nyour old pal,\r\n\r\nGrippy  (a.k.a. Dick Ferrell)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy reply:\r\n\r\nYou want to know who eats fake onions?  Actors, that’s who.\r\n\r\nLook no further than those sub-titles you see on TV commercials:\r\n\r\n		REAL PEOPLE, NOT ACTORS	\r\n\r\nReal people eat real onions.  Which leaves actors, who are, apparently, not real people, to eat the fake ones.\r\n\r\nBy the way, that’s one problem composers don’t have.  You never see:\r\n\r\n		REAL PEOPLE, NOT COMPOSERS\r\n\r\nYour theory about the bean company’s ‘bean counter’ is clever, but the fact is that the truth-in-labeling policy began in the aftermath of the Great Scallion Scam of ‘66.  \r\n\r\nSome fancy restaurants were caught using sham shallots in their risotto, less-than-likely leeks in their vichyssoise and so called ‘cheatin’ chives’ over sour cream on baked potatoes.  \r\n\r\nAfter hearings, Congress decreed that the use of real onions and other edible members of the Amaryllidaceae family of plants must be plainly stated on menus and on the labels of canned foods.  The FDA enforces this rule and woe betide the bean company that fails to “bea-n” compliance.\r\n\r\nAnytime you need to be set straight on something, just let me know.  Glad to be of assistance.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of grocery stores, have you noticed those signs in grocery carts that say, “Children not allowed to ride in carts” ?\r\n\r\nIt makes sense.  Small children are unpredictable.  They might suddenly stand up and tumble out, incurring injuries.  No one wants that.  Safety first.\r\n\r\nTo ride in a cart, then, you have to be a  grownup.  My question is, how old do you have to be to ride in a grocery cart? \r\n\r\nWe used to have to wait for our 21st birthday before we could vote.  In our late teens, we could enlist in the armed forces, and possibly be asked to die for our country; yet we weren’t considered old enough to cast a ballot to choose our leaders.  Well, they lowered the voting age, which was only right.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my question, would an 18-year-old be permitted to ride in a cart?  If so, why not a 15-year-old?  a 12-year-old?\r\n\r\nIn my dad’s day, a youth had to be 12 to join the Boy Scouts.  When you and I joined Scouts in the early ‘60’s, the entrance age had been lowered to 11.  Nowadays, it’s 10.5.\r\n\r\nSeems like, if you’re old enough to join the Boy Scouts and go on hikes and campouts and cook your food over a campfire and all that good stuff, then you ought to be old enough to ride in a grocery cart.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked the manager at Kroger’s about this he just looked at me.\r\n\r\nyour old pal,\r\n\r\nSodie  (a.k.a.

We lived there from 1986 to 1994, inhabiting a charming, 19th-century home with fireplaces, cozy low ceilings, wormy chestnut beams, exposed brick walls, old windows with wavy glass and little bubbles in the panes.  We were surrounded by hardwood forest on three sides and our two-thirds of an acre boasted no less than forty mighty oak trees.  \r\n\r\nEvery spring the yard burst forth in, truly, about 10,000 daffodils.  Previous owners had planted them but we dug up the bulbs, busted them apart and replanted them so that they spread and spread, more each year.  The results were amazing.  The yard looked like a movie set or the cover of a bulb-seller’s mail-order brochure.  Villagers walked past our house, just to see the display of daffodils.  \r\n\r\nBest of all, our kids were little and, every moment of every day, we felt that we were, not just a couple, but a family living together.\r\n\r\nOur next door neighbor was Susan Browning, a devoted amateur clarinetist and a passionate dog-lover.  Sometimes she called to ask if our noble Springer spaniel, whom we had named “Binsche,” would like to come along with Trim, her stately, beautiful collie, for an ice cream cone treat.  The dogs would pile into Susan''s car and we’d watch as Susan backed out of our driveway, the dogs’ heads already sticking out the partially rolled-down back windows, tongues out, ears flapping in the wind.  When the three of them returned, Susan would very seriously assure us that “the boys” had enjoyed their ice cream, as if we had doubted if such would be case and were in need of assurance.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Susan commissioned me to write a suite for unaccompanied clarinet.  She did not want a virtuoso concert work, just a set of fun, short pieces that she could play at home for her own amusement. \r\n\r\nI wrote twelve little pieces for her, collectively entitled, “A College Town Diary: 12 Months in Gambier.”\r\n\r\nThe piece is a “diary,” i.e., a private journal of thoughts, sentiments and sarcasms, carefully recorded but not necessarily intended for public scrutiny.  Being a “diary,” the piece is personal, opinionated and a little eccentric … like Susan … like myself.\r\n\r\nTwelve movements — even short movements — would make a long haul for a clarinetist performing unaccompanied in front of an audience.  Now and then clarinetists have fashioned a handful of the movements into short suites, more suitable for concert use.  That’s fine with me.  A few years ago, I devised a “Suite from A College Town Diary,” arranging six of the movements for clarinet and piano.\r\n\r\n(By the way, I’ll gladly send PDFs of these scores — free — to any of you who are interested.  Just ask.)\r\n\r\nThese days, Jo and I live in the historic heart of Cincinnati, a city with much to admire culturally, scenically, historically and some things to deplore, such as the nation''s second-highest rates of homelessness, hunger and poverty.  \r\n\r\nWe moved here for the educational opportunities the city offered our children.  After they graduated from Cincinnati’s celebrated School for the Creative & Performing Arts and left home, Jo and I stayed on in Cincinnati.  We wouldn’t be as happy in Gambier now, not without our little kids living at home with us.  And we’ve changed, too;  a tiny Ohio college town, surrounded by woods and cornfields, would feel too small for us now.\r\n\r\nThat difference is particularly felt during the month of March.  March is no treat in an Ohio city but in rural Ohio, March is bleak, almost unbearable.  Muddy, cold, gray and no holidays, except when Easter comes early.  St. Patrick’s Day doesn’t amount to much in a rural Ohio village.  Cincinnati’s Bockfest and March Madness are unknown in the Buckeye hinterland.\r\n\r\nOr rather, in a college town, there are no March holidays for the Townies.  For the students and faculty, there’s Spring Break!  They get to leave!  It’s the one joyous thing about March!  Off they go, to warmer places where they will, you may be assured, like Binsche and Trim, enjoy their ice cream.  Thus, my “March” movement is joyful after all!   And less than 90 seconds long.\r\n\r\n(The music for the “March” movement is not a march, by the way.  More like a leaping-and-bounding dance.  I reserved the notion of writing a march for the “July” movement, to evoke Gambier’s delightful Fourth of July parade.)\r\n\r\nTo hear Bill Perconti play “March” from A College Town Diary:  Twelve Months in Gambier on the alto saxophone, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 6, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThe French word for “tire” is “pneu.”  \r\n\r\nGet this:  it’s pronounced "puh-neu”.  The “p” is not silent!\r\n\r\nWhat?  "Puh-neu?”  Yep ... er, “Oui.”\r\n\r\nThis comes as a shock.  A belated April Fool’s Day joke, you ask?  No … er, “Non."\r\n\r\nSilent letters are the April Fool’s Day joke played on us, every day, by our language.\r\n\r\nLife isn''t sufficiently complicated?  How were all these silent letters foisted upon us?  \r\n\r\nThe answer is pedantic.  I know parts of it, but I say phooey.  Mocking pedantry is always more fun than being pedantic.  So, in the spirit of April Fool’s Day, let’s have some laughs.\r\n\r\nLet’s focus on the silent “p” and its cohort in crime, the silent “w."  \r\n\r\nHaving no say in the matter, we tolerate, as best we can, the silent “p” when it has the temerity to precede an “n” or an “s.”  But when it precedes a “t”, as in “ptomaine," “ptarmigan" or “Ptolemy?"  Well, really.  I mean to say.  It’s a bit much.  It might even be dangerous.\r\n\r\nWhat if silent letters constitute a linguistic bacillus?  What if they were to infect neighboring words?  What might that look like?\r\n\r\n	<< Ptroubled by a ptouch of ptomaine, Wrick Psowash pspent the day wreading the writings of Ptolemy.  "If I''m ptolerably better ptomorrow," he wreckoned, “I may ptry pto ptrap a ptarmigan.” >>\r\n\r\nNot all silent “p”s are equally egregious.  We can almost forgive the silent “p” when it is followed by an “h”, as in “phallic.”\r\n\r\nAn English professor friend overheard a fragment of a conversation between two students passing his open office door:  “I know it’s a phallic symbol,” one said to the other, "but a phallic symbol of what?”   \r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nBut enough orthography.  Let’s get to some music.  Here is another way of mocking pedantry:  listen to my little piece entitled, “An Eccentric Professor,” the fourth movement of my Suite from A College Town Diary for clarinet and piano.  \r\n\r\nUsually, at this point, I credit the musicians.  Instead, paraphrasing Hollywood’s disclaimer regarding animals, I can assure you:  no musicians were harmed in the making of this mp3.  It’s not performed by anyone.  \r\n\r\nWhat you’ll hear is a MIDI file, i.e., my computer rendering the music exactly as I’ve notated it, using a music notation program.  It sounds robotic, but that’s OK for this particular piece because part of the joke is that the music is NOT flexible or expressive.  \r\nThe tune waddles along, like an eccentric professor in shabby corduroys, crossing the campus, chomping a pipe, lugging a battered, bulging briefcase, badly in need of a haircut, his mind long since made up, once and for all, on just about everything.  “Often wrong but never in doubt!"\r\n\r\nTo hear “Eccentric Professor,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 2, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nBegone, dull care!\r\nI prithee, begone from me.\r\nBegone, dull care!\r\nYou and I shall never agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife shall dance and I shall sing,\r\n\r\nSo merrily pass the day,\r\n\r\n\r\nFor I hold it one of the wisest things\r\n\r\n\r\nTo drive dull care away.				— anon.\r\n\r\nThese are troublous times.  Daily, our sensibilities are battered; we are forced to fear the worst.  Each of us finds solace and good cheer where we can.  \r\n\r\nMe?  In the ten months since the inauguration, I’ve been reading little else than the novels and short stories of P.G. Wodehouse.  I guzzle them down, one after the next.  Bottoms up!\r\n\r\nWodehouse’s oeuvre is not everyone’s decanter of fizz.  When I read aloud passages from his work to Jo, she smiles but I soon perceive that she is mustering the self-discipline required not to squirm. \r\n\r\nI adore the writings of “Plum,” as his friends called him.  He’s funny.  \r\n\r\nMake an assertion like that and you’re bound to back it up with an example.  Thus:\r\n\r\n"Fine weather we''re having," said Mortimer, who was a capital conversationalist.\r\n"Yes," said the girl.\r\n"I like fine weather."\r\n"So do I."\r\n"There''s something about fine weather!"\r\n"Yes."\r\n"It''s - it''s - well, fine weather''s so much finer than weather that isn''t fine," said Mortimer.\r\nHe looked at the girl a little anxiously, fearing he might be taking her out of her depth, but she seemed to have followed his train of thought perfectly.\r\n"Yes, isn''t it?" she said. "It''s so - so fine."\r\n"That''s just what I meant," said Mortimer. "So fine. You''ve just hit it."\r\nHe was charmed. The combination of beauty with intelligence is so rare.\r\n\r\nRare indeed!  That makes me laugh.  \r\n\r\nHis plots are the flimsiest of scaffolds.  Paradoxically, he drapes those rickety scaffolds with just about the nimblest dialogues and most inventive prose any johnny has ever penned.  The man never misses a beat.  Every work is a gem, every sentence rings true.  He seizes upon the mot juste, every time.  His pitch is perfect.  \r\n\r\nHe makes a monkey of prosy poetasters like your friend, the undersigned.\r\n\r\nHe was every bit as prolific as Bach or Picasso.  Ninety novels!  Over five hundred short stories!  He wrote screenplays.  He wrote ''the book'' for many a hit Broadway musical, including Cole Porter’s “Anything Goes.”  Lyrics for lots and lots of songs.  Good ones, too!  Like “He’s Just My Bill” from Jerome Kern’s “Showboat” and classic tin pan alleys songs like “Look for the Silver Lining.”  He compels admiration.\r\n\r\nIn his short story, “Monkey Business,” he introduces Montrose Mulliner, an affable fool who tries his best.  We catch a glimpse of ourselves in this goofball.  \r\n\r\nMontrose utters a speech that could have been Plum’s manifesto, his artistic credo.  It’s a speech like those we sometimes find in Shakespeare wherein the author seems to be using a character as a guise so that he can speak directly to us, straight from his heart, his beliefs, his experience of life.  \r\n\r\nIt touched my heart, truth be told, because it comes pretty close to my own artistic credo, too.\r\n\r\nHere ’tis ….\r\n\r\n	“I am not a man who often speaks of these deeper things.  On the surface, no doubt, I seem careless and happy-go-lucky.  But I do hold very serious views on a citizen’s duties in this fevered modern age.  I consider that each one of us should do all that lies in his power to fight the ever-growing trend of the public mind towards the morbid and the hectic.”\r\n\r\nIn that one well-turned graf, I find summarized most of what I’ve aspired to achieve in my music, my writings, my teaching, my life’s work.  In my own small way, I have countered the morbid and the hectic as best I could, by mustering tunes and stories. \r\n\r\nNow, you are probably expecting today’s dose of my music to be light and sweet.  Sorry to disappoint.  You can’t have the Light without the Dark, nor the sweet without the bitter.  It’s gray November, after all.  Almost exactly one year since the election.  \r\n\r\nTo hear “November” from my “College Town Diary” beautifully played on the saxophone by William Perconti, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI have always loved January.\r\n\r\nMy birthday falls smack dab in the middle, on the 16th.  \r\n\r\nFrom boyhood, January sets me aglow with anticipation.  Presents, chocolate cake, best wishes for many returns of the day, feeling like a "big boy” because now it''s official:  I''m one year older.  A milestone had been passed.  \r\n\r\nNext week, I’ll pass my sixty-eighth birthday milestone.  Strange to tell, I’ve already lived longer than either of my grandfathers.  Next year, I’ll have lived longer than my father did.  After that I’ll be, so far as I know, the longest-lived male my gene pool has ever produced.\r\n\r\nMy arrival at the thresh-hold of Old Age has increased my joyful birthday feelings.  I love my present age.  I love my white beard and silvered temples, my round spectacles, my smile-wrinkles, my arresting mustache!  I love being “an old guy who can still hack it.”  My diminished ability to hear gives me a handy way out of awkward conversational moments.\r\n\r\nI love the laugh that comes when I tell my students that I am the school’s "oldest living teacher.”   They say that I am “the Gandalf of the school.”  Some of them even call me “Mr. Gandalf.”  That’s why I put together a Gandalf costume to wear to school on Halloween Day.  (See below a photo of "Mr. Gandalf" in his classroom.)\r\n\r\nFifty years older than my students, I AM their Gandalf.  \r\n\r\nLike Gandalf, I am someone with “a life” far beyond the boundaries of the students'' little world:  one little school in one little corner of the great globe.  The school is their Shire.  \r\n\r\nLike the hobbits, the students are chiefly concerned with themselves, their friends and families and the sundry goings-on in their immediate environment, more or less oblivious to much of anything else, except or beyond.\r\n\r\nHow do I measure up to Gandalf?  His concern and affection for the hobbits is genuine, as is mine for my students.  He is sometimes humorous.  Me, too.  His  esoteric knowledge of wizardry might be compared to my knowledge of the subjects I teach:  French, Music Theory, Storytelling, subjects arcane to my students.\r\n\r\nThe hobbits love Gandalf and I know my students love me.  Vice versa.\r\n\r\nBut Gandalf is also wise.  Am I?\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt in north central Middle Earth for two-thirds of a century, l must have acquired some wisdom.  What, exactly?  That’s a good question.  A January question.  A birthday question.\r\n\r\nPondering it for several weeks, in devising and revising this message, I’ve concluded that I can claim a "January wisdom,” partially expressed in the following wintry platitudes:  \r\n\r\n	Simple is best.\r\n\r\n	Pretty is important.\r\n\r\n	No sewers, no symphonies.\r\n\r\n	Invest in yourself.\r\n\r\n	If you don’t ask questions, you don’t get answers.\r\n\r\n	Trust everyone until they lie to you once; then cease trusting them.\r\n\r\n	Happiness equals Reality minus Expectations.\r\n\r\n	All we have to do is decide how to use the time that is given to us.\r\n\r\n	Do your best.  Afterwards, however it turns out, you’ll be able to say, “Well, I did my best.”\r\n\r\n	The sovereignty you have over your own work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will.\r\n\r\n	Be kind, because everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.  \r\n\r\n	There are other forces at work in the world besides the will of Evil.\r\n\r\n	Things will work out because they have to.  \r\n\r\n	Take it as it comes.  \r\n\r\n	This too shall pass.\r\n\r\nSuch is my hoard of hibernal platitudes.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of platitudes reminds me of a story about Plato, another Wise Old Man, another Gandalf.  I love this story.  It comforts me.  I try to remember to bring this story to mind whenever I find myself I festering with feelings of futility.  I love retelling it aloud, in my own words.  \r\n\r\nLet’s imagine we’re together, you and I, there in your living room.  Winter winds are blustering outside but there’s a fire in the fireplace, a colorful braided rug on the floor, the walls are brimming with bookshelves; you’re on the couch, wrapped in an afghan; I’m in the easy chair, my feet on your footstool; steam is rising from our twin cups of freshly-brewed, just-poured assam tea.  \r\n\r\nThe perfect moment for a story ….\r\n\r\n	When Plato was an old man, his disciples learned that their master, when young, had written a play.  They asked him about this and Plato acknowledged that it was true and that the play had won a prize.  \r\n\r\n	Immediately all the disciples wanted to read the play, but Plato told them that it had not seemed worthy to him and that he had burned the only copy, accomplishing by his own hand what the passing of Time would eventually have done and will eventually do to everything we humans have thought and dreamed and made.  \r\n\r\n	They were aghast.  Then it occurred to them to ask if he remembered any lines from the play and could perhaps recite them.  \r\n\r\n	Plato gazed up at the blue Mediterranean sky, tilted his bald head and drummed his fingertips on his chin.  He breathed in a great lungful of the clear, clean Hellenic air and recited a speech from his play.  \r\n\r\n	So struck were his disciples by the expressive power, the depth of thought and the transcendent majesty of what had fallen from his lips that they demanded to know:  “Master, how could you have destroyed such a marvelous thing?”  \r\n\r\n	The old philosopher shrugged.  "If it was imbued with that which is false," he told them, "then it deserved to be burned.  If it was imbued with that which is true, then neither fire nor the passing of time nor anything else will ever destroy it."\r\n\r\nTo hear “January” from my “College Town Diary” beautifully played on the saxophone by William Perconti, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nMy good wife baked several dozen "Molasses crinkles,” that prince among cookie recipes, the cookie supreme, for munching by the adult volunteers and Boy Scouts during their long, long ride in a van from Lexington, Ohio to Canada’s Algonquin Provincial Park, four hours north of Toronto, site of the troop’s annual summer high adventure canoe trip.\r\n\r\nThe Scoutmaster, my old friend Dick Ferrell, drove the van.  I rode ‘shotgun.’  After an hour or two, I opened one of the cookie tins.\r\n\r\n“What you got there?” Dick demanded to know.\r\n\r\n“Cookies!  Molasses crinkles!  The best!  Jo baked ‘em for us all to eat on the way up.”\r\n\r\n“Let me taste one of those.”  He munched, slowly, thoughtfully.  “No,” he said, “we’re not going to pass these out to the boys.  These cookies are far too tasty to waste on the likes of them.  They don’t know good food from diddley squat.  To them, McDonald’s is a gourmet restaurant.  These cookies will be reserved for the grownups.”\r\n\r\n“What gives YOU the right to make that decision?  It was my wife who baked ‘em.”\r\n\r\n“And I thank her for doing so, from the depths of my tummy.  But as it says in the Good Book, there’s no sense in casting pearls before swine.  In the Art of the Cookie, these constitute a masterwork.  Some things are for the discerning few.  The plays of Shakespeare, the paintings of Rembrandt, the symphonies of Beethoven will never be embraced by the masses, nor should they be.  The masses are content with far less.”\r\n\r\n“You’re such a snob!   Be that as it may, I insist that we share these cookies with the Scouts, all and sundry.”\r\n\r\n“Let me have another one,” he replied.  Steering with his left hand, he held the second cookie aloft in his right hand and called out to the boys.  “Listen up, you guys!  Mrs. Sowash has made cookies and sent them along.  There’s plenty to go around.  But these cookies are special, VERY special.  Probably the most delicious cookies ever devised by human ingenuity.  Before you are given a cookie, you must prove yourself WORTHY!  You must EARN the right to eat one … by naming The Principal Ingredient that Mrs. Sowash used in the making of these extraordinary cookies.”\r\n\r\n“Chocolate chips!” one Scout yelled out.\r\n\r\n“Peanut butter!” yelled another.\r\n\r\n“Nope,” said Mr. Ferrell.\r\n\r\nSugar, cinnamon, ginger, oatmeal, flour, eggs, raisins, walnuts, vanilla frosting … all were ventured, with the same result:  “Nope.”  \r\n\r\nThe Scouts’ imaginations strained further and further from the ingredients of the cookies they had known, rummaging ever more remote regions of the culinary world.  An hour went by and none had guessed The Principal Ingredient.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of weird, unnatural, bizarre and esoteric cookies had Mrs. Sowash fashioned?\r\n\r\n“Oh, come on, Dick,” I said finally.  But Dick is stubborn.  He shook his head.  Then he called out to the Scouts, “Alright, you bunch of sad sacks, I’ll give you a clue and here it is.  (Dramatic pause.)  The Principal Ingredient has to do with the hind-ends of little furry creatures.”\r\n\r\nWhat?  The hind-ends of little furry creatures?\r\n\r\nThey got to work on it.  First, they made a list of every "little furry creature" they could think of.  Squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, hamsters, girbils, rats, mice, mink, weasels, otters, beavers, koalas, chinchillas ...  Then they made a list of every word or expression for "hind-end.”  Bottom, behind, buttocks, butt, derrière, fanny, fundament, rump, hiney, keister, tush...\r\n\r\nFinally, Chris Carpenter, one of the older Scouts and one of the brightest, leapt to his feet, thrusting his forefinger into the air and whooping, “I’ve GOT it!”  He made his way to the front of the van and whispered his guess into Mr. Ferrell’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Yep!” said Mr. Ferrell, “Chris has figured it out!”  I presented Chris his hard-won cookie and, closing his eyes in ecstasy, the envy of every other heavily salivating Scout on board, he bit into the cookie.  “Ah!” he said.  “Dee-LISH-ious!” and returned to his seat.\r\n\r\nYou can’t keep a secret like that.  Soon, Todd Boebel, Chris’ equally bright best friend, came forward and, after whispering The Principal Ingredient in Mr. Ferrell’s ear, received his reward.  Gradually, one by one, the boys advanced, whispered the password, relished their reward and returned to their seats.\r\n\r\nSoon, all the Scouts had proven themselves worthy, had earned a cookie.  All except Heath Bair.  He was close.  He had all but attained enlightenment.  He had determined the two component parts of the riddle.  He had singled out the correct little furry creature.  He had pinpointed the correct synonym for “hind-end.”  \r\n\r\nBut, aghast, he could not combine the two concepts in a manner acceptable to any reasonable human being.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Heath!” the other Scouts shouted.  “Put ‘em together!  You’ve got it!  Just put ‘em together!”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be RIGHT!” Heath shouted back.  “It just can’t be RIGHT!”\r\n\r\n“Heath, no!  IT IS RIGHT!  You’ve GOT it!  Just put ‘em together!  You’ve got it!”\r\n\r\n“OH YEAH, RIGHT!” Heath shouted back, cynically and louder than ever.  “I’M SURE!  I’M SURE THAT MRS. SOWASH IS GONNA MAKE COOKIES OUT OF THE ASSES OF DEAD MOLES!”\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed as hard as laughter can be laughed.  We held our stomachs, twisted in our seats and punched each other, tears in our eyes, laughing ourselves silly, as only the male of the species can do, for a good five minutes.  \r\n\r\nHeath’s pronouncement became part and parcel of the legend and lore of Boy Scout Troop 152 of Lexington, Ohio.  For days afterwards, during our high adventure canoe trip, none of us could resist the temptation to remind Heath, every now and again, of his Moment of Truth.  “Hey, Heath,” we would say, with casual good cheer, “How ‘bout if we try and trap a few moles so''s we can rustle up some good cookies like Mrs. Sowash makes?”\r\n\r\nHeath was a good sport about it.  “Okay, you guys,” he would say with a smile and wave and a shake of his head.  “Okay, Okay.”\r\n\r\nYou’ll find Jo’s recipe for Molasses Crinkles at the end of this message.\r\n\r\nTo hear “June” from my “College Town Diary” beautifully played on the saxophone by William Perconti, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nMolasses Crinkles\r\n3/4 c. shortening\r\n1 c. brown sugar\r\n1 egg\r\n1/4 c. light molasses\r\n2 1/4 c. flour\r\n2 t. soda\r\n1/4 t. salt\r\n1/2 t. cloves\r\n1 t. cinnamon\r\n1 t. ginger\r\nMix shortening, sugar, egg and molasses thoroughly.

All very proper, observing one of the unwritten laws that grease the gears of our society. \r\n\r\nTaking one’s place in line is “comme il faut,” an unquestioned given, in English-speaking parts of the world.  Along with the Magna Carta, trial by jury, the plays of Shakespeare and the prose of Charles Dickens, it is among the many gifts Anglo-Saxia has bestowed upon the world.\r\n\r\nWe take it for granted, this instinctual willingness to wait in line, but there are broad swaths of the world where the custom is unknown.  \r\n\r\nA bus driver in Vancouver told me that twenty years earlier, when he had commenced his career behind the wheel, riders had formed lines at bus stops as a matter of course, but that, as more and more Asians swelled the local population, the practice had ceased.  He said that nowadays Vancouverites arrange themselves into a large bubble of humanity at the open bus door.  They wait as a group, politely, quietly, never shoving or elbowing, but never in a line.  He said that the spontaneous forming of lines is "not an Asian habitude."\r\n\r\n(Is this true?  I don’t know.  I merely report what he said.)\r\n\r\nI soon realized that we were lined up in front of the Morgan Library at 225 Madison Avenue.  I was in the city for a December conference but there were no events scheduled for Saturday afternoon, leaving attendees at liberty to shop and explore the city.  I’m no shopper but I love tramping crowded sidewalks, ambulating to the rhythm of the city, taking in the department stores’ Christmas window displays, honing my skills at people-watching.\r\n\r\nI had a dim idea that the Morgan Library was the erstwhile home of the Gilded Age banker J. Pierpont Morgan and that its collection of rare books, prints and paintings, illuminated scripture, original musical manuscripts notated by the likes of Beethoven, Brahms, Stravinsky and Bob Dylan (!), was available for public inspection.\r\n\r\nStill, why the line?  Would that many people wait in line for a glimpse Stravinsky’s hand-written score for “Petrouchka”?\r\n\r\nI eavesdropped on my fellow wait-in-liners, ahead and behind me, hoping to overhear a hint about what it was we were waiting to see.  No luck.  \r\n\r\nI was shy about asking, “What is it that we are waiting to see?”  I didn’t like to make plain my status as a clueless sheep shambling along with other wooly-headed members of my species, destined for the slaughter, for all I knew. \r\n\r\nAt length we were admitted.  It was warm in the foyer and I removed my hat, gloves and scarf.  We shuffled past glass display cases and through the immense library room, an eye-popper, with intricately decorated ceilings three stories overhead, gorgeous doors and paneling, medieval tapestries on the walls and, all around, carved wooden bookshelves burgeoning with “many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore." \r\n\r\nWe filed through a narrow hall that opened into a small room containing a single glass display case, flanked by armed security guards.  I saw the people ahead of me in line quite literally bowing over the display.  Had we been waiting to view a sacred relic?  Would a bow would be expected of me when my turn came? \r\n\r\nDrawing closer, I saw that the bow was necessary for a close examination of the item.  The folks ahead of me kept their investigations brief, perhaps in deference to the dozens waiting behind them or perhaps because little time was required to appreciate it, whatever it was.  Once you’ve seen it, you’ve seen it.  Time to move on.\r\n\r\nFinally, my turn came.\r\n\r\nA leather-bound notebook was displayed, opened to page one, a piece of manuscript paper covered with handwriting, with many words stricken through with a thick line of ink, with cramped revisions crowded between lines, over top the scratched-out words, all jotted in a crabbed cursive, an almost illegible longhand, distinctly Victorian.  \r\n\r\nThe first three words were plainly written, no revisions, easy to read:\r\n\r\n					“Marley was dead.”\r\n\r\nWith a pleasant shock, I realized what I was scrutinizing:  the original manuscript, written in the author’s own hand, of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” the Holy Grail of our Anglo-Saxon concept of the whole point and purpose of Christmas, our best-known, best-loved emblematicization of the possibility of redemption.\r\n\r\nIt was the perfect thing to behold in a great city on a cold December afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt was to be wondered at, though twenty seconds sufficed.  I made my way to the exit and was soon on the sidewalk.  Gloves on, scarf wrapped and knotted beneath my gray beard, hat bedecking my silvering temples, beaming at all and sundry, I might have passed for Ebenezer Scrooge as he appears at the end of the tale -- after he has turned over his new leaf, not before!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, unexpectedly, I found myself aglow with the spirit of the Season.  It showed, I’m sure, in my twinkling eyes, my affectionate grin, my red and wind-busked cheeks.  \r\n\r\nSeeing me smile and nod at them, passing Manhattanites may have thought that I was mentally deficient.  More likely, they simply assumed that I was from the Midwest and didn’t know any better.\r\n\r\nI didn’t care what anyone thought.  I felt happy to be alive and proud to be a bona fide member of the species that had produced Charles Dickens, the self-same person who, in the fullness of time, would in turn produce “A Christmas Carol."\r\n\r\nMy jovial "God-bless-us-every-one!” mood prevailed during my stroll around Manhattan that afternoon.  What I felt during those hours is precisely expressed in the “December” movement of “A College Town Diary,” my twelve-movement suite for unaccompanied clarinet or saxophone. \r\n\r\nWill you give it a listen?  It asks only a minute and eighteen seconds of your time.\r\n\r\nTo hear saxophonist William Perconti’s sly, witty rendition of “December” from A College Town Diary, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must have looked through the wrong end of a telescope.  It used to amaze me, as a kid.  Things that were big and near looked tiny and far away.\r\n\r\nWhat would it be like to HEAR music through the wrong end of an auditory telescope, if such a thing can be imagined?\r\n\r\nIt would be like hearing The William Tell Overture played upon an ocarina. \r\n\r\nBeethoven''s Emperor Concerto played on an African thumb piano.  \r\n\r\nThe Hallelujah Chorus on a kazoo.\r\n\r\nOr a loving parody of a Sousa march played, NOT by "seventy six trombones … with a hundred and ten cornets right behind,” but instead by exactly one saxophone.\r\n\r\nThe “July” movement from my College Town Diary for solo clarinet is precisely that.\r\n\r\nTo hear saxophonist William Perconti playing the movement, click the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOn a hill above the Kokosing River, overlooking the cornfields of central Ohio, reposes the village of Gambier, the seat of Kenyon College.  Founded and funded in the early 19th-century by two wealthy Englishmen, Lord Gambier and Lord Kenyon, it was intended to be what it continues to be:  a fragment of the Old World’s Etonian traditions improbably plopped smack dab in the center of the Buckeye State.\r\n\r\nMy wife, our two children and I passed six happy years living in Gambier, prior to moving to Cincinnati in 1994.  We were ’townies,’ enjoying the absence of any  affiliation with the College.  Our view of Kenyon was ironic.\r\n\r\nIrony is frequent in our conversations and literature.  Language bends toward irony much more readily than music.\r\n\r\nMusic is sincere, heartfelt.  There’s nothing ironic about Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony or Tchaikovsky’s Romeo & Juliet or Debussy’s La Mer.  In works like those, the apparent meaning IS the actual meaning.\r\n\r\nMusical irony is rare, but it does exist.  Prokofiev’s March from the Love of Three Oranges or the faux-triumphant finale of Charles Ives’ Second Symphony or Peter Schickele’s superb A Bach Portrait exemplify irony, demonstrating that a composer, like anyone else, may harbor the capacity to simultaneously admire and mock something, may mingle genuine admiration and sneering mockery.\r\n\r\nThe buildings and campus of Kenyon College are so lovely that it can be difficult to remember where they are located.  Gambier is an Anglophile’s dream and never more so than in August at the annual Opening Convocation featuring a majestic procession of banner-waving faculty ‘in full battle array,’ costumed in caps and gowns, the accoutrements of their academic status.\r\n\r\nFor me at least, a bystander in the crowds gathered on either side of “Middle Path,” watching the procession evoked an amalgam of admiration and mockery.\r\n\r\nThe twelve short movements of my suite for solo clarinet, “A College Town Diary,” express some characteristic of life in Gambier during a particular month. \r\n\r\nFor the “August” movement, I wrote an presumptuous little march in the manner of Edward Elgar’s Pomp & Circumstance marches, the most famous of which is quoted, twice.  The first time, it’s sly and a bit hidden, like me when I tried not to laugh at the sight of ''the perfessers’ waddling past in their robes, sweating under their mortar boards in the heat of an August day in Ohio.  You’ll have to listen closely to catch it the first time but it comes out from hiding pretty clearly at the end.\r\n\r\nAm I sneering at professors, Kenyon and Elgar here?  Or am I admiring those entities?\r\n\r\nSee what you think.  As you listen to “August” ask yourself, is this admiration or mockery?  \r\n\r\n( Spoiler:  It’s both!  Musical irony, violà! )\r\n\r\nTo hear saxophonist William Perconti playing the movement, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	Heath Bair blinked in astonishment.  Just beneath the surface of the water, two steps off the rocky shoreline, was a snapping turtle as big as a wheelbarrow.\r\n\r\n	Something this amazing must be shared.  Heath looked around and spotted me. \r\n\r\n	“Mr. Sowash!  Come here, quick!  You won’t believe this!”\r\n\r\n	I came right over, looked where he was pointing and jumped.\r\n\r\n	“Oh, my gosh!  This is incredible!  I never saw such a big turtle!”\r\n\r\n	I hurried back to the campsite.  We had just finished breakfast and the scouts were getting things squared away for another day of adventuring on Big Crow Lake in Ontario’s Algonquin Provincial Park.  I told them to drop whatever they were doing and follow me, quick.  They saw that I was serious and fell in behind me.\r\n\r\n	They were all amazed.  We watched Heath''s snapping turtle for a long time, speculating about his age and weight and whether or not he could ''bite your arm off.''\r\n\r\n	After a while, the others drifted back to the campsite.  Heath and I lingered.  He interested us, this testudine.  We did not interest him in the least.  Insofar as we were neither snails, worms, leeches, water plants, small fish, frogs, toads, smaller turtles nor even snakes, he gave us nary a modicum of consideration.\r\n\r\n	Heath’s discovery warranted an affirmation.  I would deliver it.\r\n\r\n	Affirmation from a family member is fine but, if a kid is lucky, such affirmations are just part of family life and not particularly cherished at the time.  \r\n\r\n	Contrariwise, when someone older and outside the family affirms a young person, it means the world.\r\n\r\n	A few elders outside my family affirmed me:  my Scoutmaster, two or three high school teachers, a college instructor.  It was enough.  I try to be alert to occasions when I can do some affirming, a way of returning the favor by passing it along.\r\n\r\n	Intending to gift Heath with an affirmation, I said, “Good work, Heath.  If you hadn’t spotted that turtle, probably none of us would ever have seen such a thing.”\r\n\r\n	Heath was still looking at the creature.  “Seeing that turtle just made my day,” he said.\r\n\r\n	So far, so good.  But then the cynical jerk that lurks in me and in all of us suddenly found his voice.  Regretting it as soon as it was out, I said, “Yeah, but what about tomorrow?  How you gonna equal that?”  What a jerk.\r\n\r\n	It didn’t phase him.  He simply said, “Oh, there’ll be somethin’ else tomorrow.  There always is.”\r\n\r\n	The words of Jesus came to me:  “Not in all Israel have I found such faith.”  \r\n\r\n 	I had thought I was being the Wise Teacher.  Now it was Heath who was teaching me:  "There’ll be somethin’ else tomorrow.  There always is.”\r\n\r\n	It’s been thirty years since Heath said that;  I remember the incident as clearly as if we’d come upon that turtle yesterday morning.\r\n\r\n	There always IS something else tomorrow.  All we have to do is expect it and keep our eyes open.  That’s how I want to live!  \r\n\r\n	May we all aspire to the wisdom and faith of the 14-year-old Heath Bair.  \r\n\r\n	Sometimes I think gangs come into existence because young men, failing to find affirmation from older men, find there a dark but better-than-nothing affirmation.  But what do I know about gangs?\r\n\r\n	Sometimes I think that young people join the military partly in hopes of being affirmed by an elder.  I remember an older man, a dealer in rare books, telling me, “When I joined the Marines, I was illiterate.  My drill sergeant taught me to read and write.  He began by fashioning a stencil I could use to sign my name.”  What an affirmation that was!\r\n\r\n	Sometimes I think that schools and colleges came into existence partly because parents, however affluent and loving, know that there are affirmations they cannot give.  They deliver their children to such institutions not only to become educated but also in hopes that the affirmation young people crave will be found there.  \r\n\r\n	The September movement from my "College Town Diary" for solo clarinet, depicts a vulnerable, homesick Freshperson.  \r\n\r\n	To hear Bill Perconti playing the September movement on his saxophone, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n	To see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nCreativity.  How do we do it?\r\n\r\nWe ask ourselves a question.  Answers come, telling us what to do.  Then, we act.\r\n\r\nSeeing the end result, people marvel.  They are inspired by the fact of our having done the work and also, hopefully, by the content of the artwork itself.  \r\n\r\n“How did you come up with that?” they ask.  Often, before we can answer, they conclude:  "I guess you’re just creative.”\r\n\r\nSure, we’re creative.  But there is a process.\r\n\r\nTwo examples.  \r\n\r\nFirst, over the past two days, I’ve written a story, a story that didn’t exist two days ago.  \r\n\r\nWhy?  How?\r\n\r\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays, I teach two 75-minute classes -- French One and French Two — to fifteen bright, funny, energetic teenagers.  I’m mid-way through my sixth year of doing this.  I love every minute of it.\r\n\r\nI have not found a French textbook that pleases me.  I’ve look at about 40 of them; only one didn’t bore me.  It’s pretty good and I use it on-and-off.\r\n\r\nLast summer I decided to write my own stories in French, for use in my courses.  My stories had to be written in simple, basic French and they had to be funny or suspenseful or both.\r\n\r\nI began by asking myself a question.  What plot would my students find funny or suspenseful?  Gradually, answers came.  I wrote about two dozen stories, each just 40 sentences long.  I numbered the sentences so that we could study them carefully, one at a time, in sequence, understanding as we went and referring back to words used in earlier sentences.  I underlined the words that would be new to the students.\r\n\r\nWell, my stories are a hit.  We’ve been through all of the stories I wrote last summer and now they want more.  You see?  I HAVE to write more stories, I HAVE to be creative.  I have put myself in the position of having no choice.  They are insisting and will not be gainsaid.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home from school on Thursday afternoon, I took a nap.  Half-asleep, I watched another new story take shape.  Our hero wants to join Robin Hood and his Merry Men (Robin des Bois et ses Joyeux Compagnons) but when he goes to Sherwood Forest the guards tell him he is too young, weak and absurd and that, in any case, the whole operation is out of business because Robin has been captured.  So, of course, with a little supernatural assistance, he rescues Robin and becomes the newest Merry Man.  All in French.  Fun stuff!  I am very eager to spring it on my classes next week.\r\n\r\nFriends, that is how creative work is done.\r\n\r\nNow, a second example.  When we lived in Gambier, Ohio, a college town, a neighbor asked me to write some music she could play on her clarinet, unaccompanied, and just for her own amusement.\r\n\r\nI asked myself, what music would Susan like to play?  A series of twelve short, fun, intriguing pieces, each depicting a calendar month.  I titled the suite “A College Town Diary.”  The suite begins with “August” since that is when the school year commences at Gambier’s Kenyon College.  This prompted me to ask myself, “What music would be apt for August in Gambier?”  And so forth, with all twelve movements.\r\n\r\nToday, I’m sharing the movement titled “February” as an example of how creativity works.  I asked, "What music for February?"  Well, with what do we associate February?  Valentine’s Day and by extension, Romantic Love.\r\n\r\nThat prompted me to ask, “What music would express Romantic Love?”  There is no shortage of precedents.  All those great love themes from Hollywood films, from Broadway musicals, from operas and tone poems.  What could I conceive that would extend, a little, those traditions?\r\n\r\nIt had to be a yearning, languorous melody, written in a major key but with a flatted sixth.  That is to say, in C major but with the sixth degree of the scale being an A flat instead of the usual A natural.  With this in mind, I noodled around in my head, humming and whistling, then trying out the shapes on the piano until -- Bingo! — the tune was born and the movement took shape.\r\n\r\nYou see?  I asked myself some questions, listened for answers and then did what the answers told me to do.\r\n\r\nThat is my account of how creative work is done.\r\n\r\nTo hear saxophonist Bill Perconti, playing “February” from A College Town Diary, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	Our happiest years as a family were 1988 - 1994 when we lived in the little college town of Gambier, Ohio.  So small, it had not a single stoplight.  Our kids, who were six- and three-years-old when we arrived attended Wiggin Street Elementary School and a very sweet place it was.\r\n\r\n	The school''s annual "May Fun Fair" was a fundraising event that featured a genuine cakewalk.  Do you know what that is?  I knew Debussy’s “Golliwog’s Cakewalk” but had never participated in a cakewalk in person.  \r\n\r\n	The piano player (me) was positioned in the center of the gym floor.   A dozen  squares in various colors of duct tape were placed on the floor in a wide circle stretching to the edges of the gym.  When the ragtime music was being played, about fifty grownups and children would shuffle and dance from square to square.  After a minute or two the music would abruptly stop and the pianist (me) would yell out the color of one of the squares.  “Red!” or “Blue!” or “Yellow!”  Whoever happened to be standing on that particular square got their choice of a “cake” from a table of baked goods the families had prepared.\r\n\r\n 	This was a very big deal, especially for the children.   You were not allowed to win twice; nearly everyone triumphed, winning at least a cupcake.\r\n\r\n	Happy Memories!\r\n\r\n	I improvised quasi-ragtime tunes and one of them stuck in my head, becoming the “May” movement of my College Town Diary, originally scored for solo clarinet.\r\n\r\n	To hear saxophonist Bill Perconti playing “May” from A College Town Diary, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again this year, same as last year, April Fool’s Day came and went and I wasn’t able to play any tricks, one small factor of life during a pandemic.\r\n\r\nSo instead of playing one on you, I’m going to let you in on one of my favorites, a stunt I’ve pulled dozens of times.\r\n\r\nFirst, the set up.  A practical joke must be set up.  The set up for this one is intricate and must be done exactly right.  Read the following instructions carefully and follow them ‘to a t.’  Practical joking is a serious business!\r\n\r\nYou’re giving someone a lift in your car.  Our car happens to be a 2013 Honda Fit, but the type of car you have doesn’t matter; the trick can be done with any kind of car.  \r\n\r\nYour prospective victim must not be a family member; your family knows you too well.  They know you’re a trickster and they won’t fall for it.  Maybe your passenger is a fellow chorister and you are kindly giving them a ride home after choir rehearsal (when such things resume).\r\n\r\nAfter you’ve both settled in for the ride and have been chatting for a while, your passenger will very likely ask you something about your vehicle.  People are curious about cars, particularly newer models; it’s a source of conversation.  The advent of electric cars will heighten this curiosity, opening new vistas of opportunity for those who know this trick.\r\n\r\nYour passenger will ask, “So, how do you like your _______?” (Tesla, Prius, Honda or whatever) ...\r\n\r\nYou must wait for your victim to pose this question.  The victim must introduce the topic, not you.  This gives them the illusion that they are controlling the dialogue.  \r\n\r\nIf they don’t ask, you must resist the temptation to inquire.  Do not say, “Would you like to know how I like my [your model] ?”  That would tip your hand.  Likewise, do not say, “Let me show you a peculiar feature of my [your model].”  Such statements raise suspicions and will alert the passenger. \r\n\r\nWait for the inquiry in an expectant silence.  If you are blessed with or suffer from logorrhea, pleonasm and/or periphrasis, or all of the above, as I do, the long, silent wait will be difficult for you.  Trust me, your patience will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nWhen they finally make the inquiry, reply truthfully.  Say: “Oh, I like it just fine.  It handles well and it gets good mileage.  It’s easy to parallel park and can make sharp turns.”\r\n\r\nLet this sink in for a moment, then continue in the same, matter of fact tone.\r\n\r\n“It has some pretty cool features.”  Name one or two.  These can be very minor but they must be true.  Tell them about the cute little icon that lights up when the gas is low.  Or the cheery little beeps that remind you to buckle up.\r\n\r\nThen, in the same truth-telling tone of voice, you add, “Also, the horn is on the dashboard.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Yep.”\r\n\r\nSteering with your left hand, you extend your right hand until you can lightly press your fingers onto the dashboard directly in front of your passenger.  Your passenger will be watching your right hand.  At the precise moment you press the dashboard with the fingertips of your right hand, you use your left thumb to give the horn (which is, of course, actually on the steering wheel), a toot.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be darned!” they’ll say.  “I never heard of this!”\r\n\r\n“It makes a lot of sense,” you say, reasonably, appreciatively.  “Suppose you spot something that I don’t -- like a deer running out of the woods or a car in front of us suddenly hitting the brake -- well, with the horn on the dashboard, YOU can sound the toot!”\r\n\r\nThen you say, “You can try it if you like, but not right now.”  Refer to the actual traffic situation in which you find yourself, saying something like, “I don’t want this guy in front of us to think that we’re tooting at him.”  Or, “Wait until we get through this intersection.”\r\n\r\nYour passenger will wait, exclaiming the while, “This is amazing!  How clever!”  \r\n\r\nAt this point in the proceedings, my friend Claire announced, “A WOMAN thought of this!  I just KNOW that it was a woman’s idea!  Her husband was driving and she told him to toot the horn at some jerk who just sat there after the traffic light had turned green -- and her husband wouldn’t do it!  And THAT was when the idea popped into her head!”\r\n\r\nOf course, your passenger will be very eager to toot the dashboard-horn, but they will wait respectfully.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the traffic situation would seem to allow for an impunitious toot, you say, “Now’s a good time.”\r\n\r\nThey press the dashboard.  Nothing happens.\r\n\r\n“That’s funny,” you say, reaching over with your right hand again and pressing.  This time it toots.  \r\n\r\nThey try again.  Nothing.\r\n\r\n“Maybe you’re not pushing hard enough,” you suggest, trying to be helpful.\r\n\r\nThey push on the dashboard even harder but nary a toot is heard.\r\n\r\nYou could try to time an actual toot with the moment they make their third attempt, but timing it just right is very difficult.  I usually just let them continue to push in vain.\r\n\r\nYou will be surprised at the people who will fall for this.  My favorite victims are college professors.  But I’ve pulled it on doctors, lawyers, pastors, teachers, students, actors, musicians.  All walks of life.  It never fails.\r\n\r\nFrom this point forward, play it as it comes.  Driving our 2013 Honda Fit, I sometimes will say, “The honking dashboard was only in the 2013 Honda Fit.  The feature was discontinued after that.  Most people just didn’t know about it.  We only discovered it by accident.  I mean, it’s in the driver’s manual but who actually reads a driver’s manual?  Life’s too short for that.”\r\n\r\nSummarize thus:  “What times we live in, eh?”  Shake your head in wonder and add, “What will they think of next?”\r\n\r\nIn my “Suite from ‘A College Town Diary’” for clarinet and piano, there’s a movement titled “Eccentric Professor.” \r\n\r\nAlas, this suite has not yet been recorded.  I can only offer you the mp3 of a MIDI file, i.e., my computer’s aural rendering the score.\r\n\r\nIt sounds robotic, but for this particular piece ‘robotic’ is OK, because the joke is that the music, like the eccentric professor it portrays, is inflexible.\r\n\r\nThe tune waddles along, like an eccentric professor, badly in need of a haircut, wearing a shabby corduroy jacket and wool tie, chomping a pipe, lugging a battered, bulging briefcase as he makes his way across the campus on an April day.\r\n\r\nHis mind has long since been made up, once and for all, on just about everything.  Often wrong, but never in doubt!  He probably hasn’t even noticed that Spring has arrived.  What he needs is to have a good practical joke played on him.  What he needs is the honking dashboard.\r\n\r\nto hear the MP3 file of “Eccentric Professor,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),161);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(48,replace(replace('Hello —\r\n\r\nWhatever your faith or absence thereof, please know I''m wishing that today — Easter Sunday — will be a happy one for you.\r\n\r\nI read somewhere the fascinating suggestion that a capacity for religious experience may be genetic.  It’s an attractive notion; it''s brought me exhilaration and relief.  It liberates the religious impulse from intellectual tedium.  A person is religious, not because they’ve convinced themselves that they can prove the existence of a Deity or because they’ve somehow reconciled the idea of a loving God with the fact of Evil.  No. Being religious is simply in their DNA.  \r\n\r\nMetaphysics interested me when I was a teenager.  I had a dim idea that Great Minds wrestled with such things and that, if I were to have a Great Mind, I was obliged to join in.  You are older now than I was then; you know what follows:  feverish disputation, resentment and alienation.  These might be endured if there was any hope of a rational resolution to the Great Questions, but eventually I concluded that there was no such hope and grew weary of the whole business.  I set it all aside and found, to my surprise, that I remained quite religious, regardless of the irrationality of it.  I have been at peace with my own appetite for religion, ever since.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t need to make sense.  If it’s absurd, fine.  I inherited the religious gene, apparently, along with brown eyes, musical ability and a bundle of other traits.  And that’s that.  I couldn’t be non-religious any more than I could change my eye-color to blue or turn tone-deaf.  It’s who I am.\r\n\r\nMy dear wife, my partner and best friend, the love of my life for nearly 50 years, hasn’t the slightest appetite for religion.  It does not run in her family.  I go to church every Sunday.  Jo stays home, watching “Meet the Press.”   I pray and ponder, many times, every day.  If Jo prays or ponders the Will of God, she has never made it known to me.  \r\n\r\nOur daughter seems to have inherited the gene from my side, while our son is like his Mama, non-religious.  Happily, the non-religious half of our little family gets along just fine with the religious half.  It’s no big deal.  We like each other and religion rarely comes up.  When it does, we’re respectful.  We tilt our heads and listen thoughtfully. When I give thanks before a family meal, all four heads are bowed.  We have lots of other things to talk about and most of them are more fun than religion.\r\n\r\nI’ve written quite a lot of sacred choral music, ie., music intended to be sung in worship services.  Religious feeling sometimes finds its way into my instrumental works as well.\r\n\r\nToday being Easter, I’m inviting you to listen to the second movement of my Sonata for cello and piano, entitled “Largo Religioso.”  I think you will like it, whatever your DNA, “religiously-wise-speaking” (as the great musical humorist Peter Schickele would say). You don’t need to have inherited the religious gene to enjoy this music.  I know that’s so because my Jo loves this recording!\r\n\r\nJo, and shortly you, are among the very few who have heard this music.  I wrote the sonata in 1990 for my cellist friend and mentor Terry King but it has rarely been performed.  I have never heard it performed live.  It has only recently been recorded and will be featured on a CD of cello works which I hope to issue next year.\r\n\r\nTo hear my friends — cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Sam Black — playing “Largo Religioso,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 27, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI want to give you a ‘sneak peek’ into a new CD of my music, due out next year.  The CD will be titled “Seasonal Breezes” and will offer premiere recordings of several of my cello works played by a superb cellist, my friend Josh Aerie.\r\n\r\nToday, you’ll be almost the first to hear one of the tracks.\r\n\r\nThe central work on the CD will be my Sonata for Cello and Piano, a deeply felt work I wrote in 1990 for another superb cellist, my friend and mentor, Terry King.  \r\n\r\n1990?  The CD coming out in 2018?  That’s 28 years!  It takes a long time to get a piece recorded and issued on a CD.  Everything happens slowly in the world of classical music.\r\n\r\nI have waited until this weekend, just prior to September 11 with its tragic connotations, to share this deeply felt music with you.\r\n\r\nTwice now, I’ve termed this music “deeply felt."\r\n\r\nWhat is meant when we say music is “deeply felt.”  To whose deep feelings do we refer?   In whose psyche do those profound, unsettling feelings reside?  Whose tragedy is experienced when tragic music is played and heard?  Who is experiencing it?\r\n\r\nThe musicians?  No.  If the musicians permit themselves to experience the full extent of the sadness that is evoked when they play deeply sorrowful music, they would be reduced to weeping, rendering themselves unable to perform.  Musicians, when performing, are not at liberty to be overwhelmed by their emotions.  They have a job to do, a technically demanding job that requires intense concentration.\r\n\r\nThe composer?  No.  The composer’s task is even more demanding, technically, than the musicians’.  Tremendous concentration is required.  I do not feel sorrowful when I write sorrowful music, nor joyful when I write joyful music.  The emotions I’ve experienced while writing music are mostly anxiety and fear.  More on that in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe listeners?  Yes.  The majestic sorrow in majestically sorrowful music is yours; it evokes your sense of the tragic, your sorrow in contemplating the losses you’ve suffered, the thought of your own departure, the attendant loss it will bring to the people whom you love and who love you.  At the moment of performance and perception, those feelings are neither the musicians'' nor the composer’s.  Those feelings are yours.\r\n\r\nUnderstand from this assertion how important you are as a listener; understand that you are crucial to the experience of music.  Unheard music is as meaningless as a painting that never gets painted, a book that never gets written.\r\n\r\nNon-composers are curious about the feelings of composers.  A friend asked me, "What does it feel like, what emotions do you have, when you are composing?”\r\n\r\nWe can be honest with a friend.  I ventured an honest answer.  My emotions when writing music are:  initial excitement, soon followed by an irksome anxiety and growing fear, leading to a mingling of regret and tentative delight, finally arriving at relief.  \r\n\r\nI am unaware of any other composer who may have tried to explain what I mean.  So instead of quoting another composer, by way of explanation, I will quote two great writers.\r\n\r\nThis from Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary.”  \r\n\r\n	“Human speech is like a cracked kettle on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.”\r\n\r\nAnd this from Virginia Woolf''s "To the Lighthouse.” \r\n\r\n	"She could see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment’s flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.  Such she often felt herself—struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to say:  “But this is what I see; this is what I see,” and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast … "\r\n\r\nThese writers know.  Note the phrase, “as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.” \r\n\r\nIn creating music, what I have feared is that, once again, I will ‘blow’ it, I will compromise.  I am afraid that as what I was trying to capture slips away from what I envisioned, from what I aspired to, I will deceive myself, pretending that I am satisfied or, worse, that I will convince myself that no one will notice the compromises I make, the many passages which I settled for less.  I have sometimes found myself literally holding my breath in fear as I plunked ahead on the piano, scratching the notes onto score paper or keyboarding the notation on my computer.  \r\n\r\nYears after a piece is finished, when I hear it, I can still spot the places where I caved.  I curse myself for those flaws.  Damn!  I came so close!  If only I had tried harder!\r\n\r\nNo musical ideas come to reality without being diminished in the process by a great many compromises.  The finished work always falls short of the hopes I cherished for it when I commenced to write it down.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing can overcome the paralyzing effect of all this fear:  the conviction that the idea is GREAT, that it MUST be to brought to reality, that it is divinely inspired will of God, that it expresses and extends the trajectory of the human race, that it affords an invaluable glimpse ahead into what my painter friend Sean Sexton calls “nextwhere,” that the existence of this new work will extend consciousness, change lives, change the world, will fulfill the purpose of music that Schubert proclaimed when he said that the reason he composed music was “to improve Reality."\r\n\r\nTo move forward in spite of fear requires a very strong ego, strong enough to have sufficient faith in the importance of one’s own ideas, even though we know that, in the greater scheme of things, the value of our ideas is scant, that “a hundred years from now, what will be the difference?”  Our precious ideas will have been forgotten.  This is easily proven.  How much music that was written by American classical composers a hundred years AGO — that is, in the year 1917 — is remembered today?  \r\n\r\nPeople say that artists are egotistical.  Of COURSE they are.  Artists MUST be egotistical to muster the gumption to create anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the piece is finished, the struggle over, I feel regret that it didn’t turn out as well as I’d hoped, delight that it turned out as well as it did, and relief that, for better or worse, I know that I did the best I could and completed the task.\r\n\r\nMuch of the above described emotional journey parallels the emotional content of the first movement of my cello sonata, the music that’s waiting for you to discover today.  The excitement is there, the anxiety and fear, the delight in moments of beauty and a certain majesty.  \r\n\r\nYou may find your own sorrows and joys reflected in it as well.  May your hearing of it  comfort you on this weekend of the remembrance of the events of September 11.\r\n\r\nTo hear my friends cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Sam Black playing the first movement of my Sonata for Cello and Piano -- so beautifully! — click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nToday?  A ‘sneak peek’ into a new CD of my music, to be unloosed upon an unwitting world sometime later this year.  The CD will be titled “Seasonal Breezes” and will offer premiere recordings of several of my cello works played by a superb cellist, my friend Josh Aerie.\r\n\r\nThe central work on the CD will be my Sonata for Cello and Piano, written in 1990 for another superb cellist, my friend and mentor, Terry King.  \r\n\r\nToday I want to share the sonata''s third movement.  Except for the audiences present when Josh has played this work in recitals, you will be the first to hear this music.\r\n\r\nThat’s exciting, don’t you think?  Most of the ‘classical’ music we hear comes to our attention already festooned with ‘seals of approval.’   Not this time!  You’ll be using your critical faculties untrammeled by generations of critics who have long since pronounced upon the value of the music.  In the world of ‘classical’ music, that is a rare experience.\r\n\r\nComposed in 1990?  The CD coming out in 2018?  That’s 28 years!  \r\n\r\nYep.  It takes a long time to get a piece recorded and issued on a CD.  Everything happens slowly in the world of classical music.  The compensation is that the music doesn’t age, has no ‘shelf life,’ comes with no warning:  “best if consumed before February 4, 2018."\r\n\r\nHearing this music, you could not guess if it was written three weeks ago, three years ago or three decades ago.  \r\n\r\nI’ve said it was written in “the ’90’s,” but you will listen in vain for the influences of Madonna, Michael Jackson or Prince.  It doesn’t sound like “the 90’s."\r\n\r\nIt might be a little easier to guess where it was written because it is clearly the work of an American composer coming to terms with Beethoven, especially in the louder, triumphant parts.  \r\n\r\nBeethoven’s spirit is alive in this work, intentionally.  It is an homage to the master, the greatest of all composers in my opinion.  In three or four of my works, I deliberately tried to allow his great spirit to breathe again and afresh through my music.  I’ve attempted to mingle Beethoven-like gestures with the American musical vocabulary inherited from Copland, Barber and the great Hollywood film score composers.  \r\n\r\nI might have subtitled this music, “Beethoven Goes West” but that risked trivializing it.\r\n\r\nWhen the new CD is available, I will announce it in an email and ask for the address to which you want me to send your free copy.  Some of you will want to send me some money in return and I won’t refuse it.  In fact, some of you have already sent me some money in support of this CD''s production costs.  \r\n\r\nToo, as I have done with all my CDs, I will send this new CD to 165 American classical music radio stations.  The packaging and postage are expensive.  So … “all contributions will be gratefully accepted” … and sincerely appreciated … but neither necessary nor expected.  \r\n\r\nSimply an exchange of gifts.  That’s how I see it.\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasure and my calling to share my work with anyone who is interested in discovering it.\r\n\r\nTo hear my friends cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Sam Black playing the third movement of my Sonata for Cello and Piano -- so beautifully and with such energy! — click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),78);

He performed with “les Gavottes”, the Riviera-based trio that recorded my first three trios for clarinet, cello and piano, written specifically for the group. \r\n\r\nI sent Jean my works for solo keyboard, including “Pensée," the earliest piece of my music which I still value, written in 1968, when I was 18 years old.  \r\n\r\nToday, what is surprises me about this little piece is the extent to which it shows that I was already so completely myself when I wrote it.  When you listen, I think you’ll agree.  You’ll think, “Yes, this sounds like something R.S. would write."\r\n\r\nMy high school music teachers taught me 90% of what I needed to know about music in order to do my life’s work.  During my college years I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a middle ground between who I really was, musically, and the composer the faculty at the illustrious School of Music I attended seemed to want me to be.  The implication was that if I didn’t cave in and write avant garde music, I could not have a career.  But I was not cut out to be an avant garde composer.  Musically, I was always a Conservative.  “Derrière garde,” yes.  Avant garde, no.\r\n\r\nHappily, after graduating, I recovered my authentic voice.   \r\n\r\nI named this piece “Pensée” because it means “a thought” in French.  This is humorous because, at that time, my relationship with the French language had been a disaster.  At the time I wrote the piece, I had had one year of high school French and had bombed badly, earning the only “D” of my academic career.  I was too busy writing music and fiction to bother learning French.\r\n\r\nAll the same, teenager that I was, I thought the title “Pensée” would sound intelligent, worldly and high-falutin’.  When I was 18 I never dreamed I would soon return to studying French again — with seriousness this time -- let alone that I would someday  teach French (as I have been doing very happily for the past two years).\r\n\r\nYet the title is apt.  This IS a thoughtful piece.  Especially the way Jean Tatu plays it.  His rendering is tender and simple.   I love to watch him play in the Youtube he kindly sent me, especially the way he lifts his hands from the keyboard after sounding the last chord.  It reminds me that music-making is a thing we can relish visually as well as aurally.  That reverent, poetical gesture reveals the love Jean has for his instrument and for Music.\r\n\r\nTo hear Jean Tatu playing “Pensée” for solo piano, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo both see and hear Jean Tatu playing “Pensée, go to this youTube website:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqMX6bBu1Zw\r\n\r\nWhat times we live in when sharing such things is this easy!\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 3, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n2020 sucks eggs.  Let’s escape to the far away and long ago.\r\n\r\nOne day back in 1968, when I was 18 years old, fooling around at the piano, I suddenly discovered the first four chords of the piece.  I saw where those chords were pointing and I let the piece unfold, let the music go where it wanted to go.  It was one of those rare occasions when a piece fell on me out the blue, almost writing itself.\r\n\r\nToday, what surprises me about this little piece is the extent to which it shows that I was already so completely and thoroughly my mature self when I wrote it.  Listen and you’ll agree:  “Yes, this sounds like something R.S. would write.”\r\n\r\n... The music sounds French, a little like the simpler movements of Ravel’s “Mother Goose Suite” for piano four hands.  ... If you’re a pianist, print it and play it.\r\n\r\nWhat times we live in!  There is much to curse in the present moment, but at 18, I never dreamed that a time would come when sharing music with friends could be this easy!

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(50,replace(replace('Our son, Chapman, 31, is my favorite guy.  On his Facebook page, he advises his friends:  “Be an interesting Cincinnatian” and he practices what he preaches.  An extraordinarily versatile trombonist, he has made numerous tours of America and Europe with a variety of bands.  Here in Cincinnati, he’s the co-founder of the Hot Magnolias, the Queen City’s chief exponent of traditional New Orleans jazz.  But he also plays with several other bands, ''local and beyond,’ in styles ranging through reggae, ska, rockabilly, Dixieland, soul and funk.  He’s making his fourth European tour next month as a guest trombonist with The Toasters, a famous ska band.\r\n\r\nHe’s written only a few songs, but they are strong.  The Blues song he wrote and played at my mother-in-law’s funeral brought tears to our eyes.  His ska tune is entitled “Higher Ground” and was recorded by another band he helped to found, The Pinstripes.  I liked the opening tune of “Higher Ground" so much that I made it the recurring theme in the joyful, exuberant "Finale" movement of my cello concerto.  I want to share that movement with you today.\r\n\r\nAt the website linked above, you’ll hear Chap''s tune immediately, catchy and compelling, played by the brass.  Take in at least the first thirty seconds so that when you listen to the “Finale" concerto movement, posted below, you’ll see how it was adapted.  Click on the link to hear The Pinstripes playing Chap’s tune, “Higher Ground.”\r\n\r\nSince the tune is the style of ska, the tempo of the “Finale" movement of my concerto is indicated as "Tempo di ska.”  The opening three measures establish the beat, the key and the feel.  Then the solo cello renders Chap’s tune, somewhat as you heard it in “Higher Ground.”  The same, yet not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, right quick, the clarinet plays tune as a trickster might, ornamented and sassy, an octave higher than the cello you just heard and with jazz and Klezmer inflections.\r\n\r\nThus, the clarinet immediately establishes itself as a rival to the cello.  It’s a theatrical device.  Sometimes the clarinet steals the spotlight from the solo cello.  At other times the clarinet supports the cello’s solo role.  At still other times the clarinet retreats, a pale color amid the strings.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a metaphor.  The clarinet is the piece’s only wind instrument and the only black instrument in the ensemble.  All the other instruments are the color of varnished wood.  The clarinet is the outsider — or is he?  It’s as if the clarinet is the black man in a white society or a Jew in Christendom.  What is the difference between merely being present and truly belonging?  What does it mean to belong?  Having one’s contributions accepted and appreciated by the majority?\r\n\r\nConsider that ska was created by Jamaicans, jazz and the blues by African-Americans and Klezmer by Jews.  And here is our clarinet friend, in this concerto, evoking ska, jazz and Klezmer.  See what’s happening?  But, here, in this work, the clarinet is not an outsider, not a “black sheep,” because in this work those ‘outsider’ minority musical traditions are reconciled with classical European traditions. \r\n\r\nHow?  At 2:15 the music abruptly, unexpectedly turns 18th-century, Viennese.  With almost no modulation, there are improbable changes:  to a new key -- G minor — and a new meter -- 6/8.  We’ve visited this world many times before.  It brings images to mind  musicians in frock coats, knee stockings and powdered wigs, a polite and ordered society.  It’s the world of Haydn.   \r\n\r\nWhat happened to Chap’s ska tune?  It’s still there but hidden, played pizzicato in the lower register by the cellos and basses.    \r\n\r\nBut the main action here constitutes an homage to Haydn.  Why Haydn?.  Because he so effectively reconciled humor with nobility and surprise with architectural integrity.   That’s what I’m trying to do in this concerto.  The Haydn-esque section is both an homage and a joke but I don’t think Papa Haydn would be offended;  no one loved a musical joke better than he.\r\n\r\nAbout 3:24 the music picks up speed and starts to cook again.  By 3:41 it’s really goin’ to town and sounds, to me, like a hit song from one of George M. Cohan’s old-fashioned Broadway musicals.\r\n\r\nThe tunes are developed and expanded and at 5:19 comes the movement’s climax, when the cello descends from a high A and lands in the unanticipated key of Eb major. This new key is the extreme opposite of A major, the key in which the movement and the entire concerto are cast.  \r\n\r\nThis brief venture into Eb major reconciles the opposing extremes of the circle of fifths, echoing the reconciliation of musical styles and traditions that is attempted throughout.  The chugging 16th-notes in the strings in this section always prompt me to imagine a little locomotive, flying down the tracks.  For me, this section recalls the fun and silliness of Leroy Anderson’s wonderful little tone poems.  You might call it “The Little Engine Who Could."\r\n\r\nBut the piece doesn’t end there.  The moment for a big cello cadenza is prepared but the cellist abandons the attempt, playing instead a sort of “anti-cadenza.”  Instead of a flashy virtuoso display, the cello simply plays a little figure on the A string with the open D string sounding underneath.  The figure is short and it gets shorter each time the cellist repeats it, gradually releasing the energy that had nearly reached the bursting point; after our little locomotive just about burst its boiler, this "anti-cadenza" gradually lets the pressure escape.\r\n\r\nNow comes one last quiet surprise:  the tenderness of the cello.  Using its delicate middle strings, the cello plays a plagal cadence, like the “Amen” at the end of a hymn, returning at last to the solemn, heartfelt hymnody that began the opening movement, twenty minutes earlier.  The cello affirms:  "Joyfulness can be funny, yes, even rambunctious … but also, at the end of the day, joyfulness comes in response to the Sacred."  \r\n\r\nAll the opposites presented in the work -- opposites of mood, style, key, genre, the clash of the solo cello and his rival, the clarinet -- are reconciled at last and the concerto ends in quiet dignity.\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 24, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAfter several years of gentle pestering, the Bulgarian-American cellist Kalin Ivanov finally convinced me, by dangling the prospect of a premiere performance in Carnegie Hall, to write a concerto for him.  True to his word, he premiered the work in Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall and he has performed the piece many times since.\r\n\r\nHe recently sent me a marvelous recording of his performance with the Las Colinas Symphony, a Dallas-area orchestra.  I’m eager for you to hear all four movements, but .  let’s listen to the first movement today.\r\n\r\nKalin and I talked at length about the piece before any notes were written down.  We agreed it should be tuneful, tonal, accessible.  Born in Bulgaria, now a new American citizen, Kalin wanted a piece that would bridge the two cultures, combining European and American musical gestures.\r\n\r\nWhat is more American-sounding than a folk hymn?  The concerto begins quietly, with the cello playing an original folk hymn, all the way through, all by himself.  Then the clarinet plays it, the cello in canon right behind, with the strings plucking a tentative accompaniment.  Eight minutes later, after a tumble of fugues, the hymn returns at the end of the movement, played in rich harmonies by the entire ensemble.\r\n\r\nWhat is more European-sounding than a fugue?   Between the opening statements of the hymn and the return of the hymn at the end, come two fugues, both derived from the second line of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.”  The subject is derived from the notes we sing with the words, “Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack.”  It’s disguised a bit, so listen carefully at 2:02 and see if you can spot that fragment.  The fugues climax at 6:20 with a quotation of the ending of that beloved song:  “For it’s one, two, three strikes you’re out at the old ball game.”  it’s slightly altered and it goes by quickly.  So listen carefully!\r\n\r\nI remember my grandmother Kate Hoff, my Nana, singing that song with gusto … and she and my grandfather were both born in Serbia, not far from Bulgaria.  Arriving in Ohio as immigrant children, they were intensely proud to be Americans, eager to embrace the culture of their adopted homeland, a homeland that, they felt, had adopted them.  Remembering this, I am pained by the anti-immigrant rhetoric we hear so often today.  My experience of immigrants is personal; I think of my grandparents and what they brought to this country.\r\n\r\nIn between the two fugues, at 5:30, comes another folk hymn, contrasting with the opening one, and very sweet.  The fugues end with the cello’s cadenza, a bridge back to the hymn tune that began the movement.\r\n\r\nYou’ll notice that the clarinetist is the cellist’s rival, competing for the spotlight usually reserved, exclusively, for the concerto''s soloist.  This is yet another metaphor.  The clarinet is the outsider, a minority of one, a wind instrument, dull black with silver keys, while all the other instruments are made of strings and shining, varnished wood.  Like any minority worth its salt, the clarinet brings richness, color and diversity to the whole.\r\n\r\nThe movement is entitled “Hymns and Fugues.”  It juxtaposes and, for me at least, reconciles the very different musical gestures of the American and European traditions.\r\n\r\nTo hear the opening movement of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of a cello/clarinet/piano reduction of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 21, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAwhile back, when I was railing against the term “classical music,” one of you kindly replied to suggest I should instead use the word “classycal."\r\n\r\nI like the coined word “classycal” even though it’s too cute for practical purposes.  I like the flippant hint of caution against trying too hard to be “classy.”  I like the gentle mockery of the term “classical”, which, like “fine arts," could do with a bit of gentle mocking.\r\n\r\nWhich in turn reminds me of the humorous, wise quip attributed to Fats Waller:\r\n\r\n“Some people got more class than what’s good for ‘em,” Fats said, "but the rest ain’t got no class at all.”\r\n\r\nAll told, I’d rather be among those in the former category.\r\n\r\nFats was black.  Me, I’m a white guy.  I like plain yogurt, Basmati rice and mayonnaise.  I put miniature marshmallows on top of my Cream of Wheat.  That is something that white people do.  (I’m joking, just so you know.)\r\n\r\nI have a deep admiration for what African-Americans have achieved, musically and otherwise.  In our shared American history, Louis Armstrong is among the Americans I most admire.  An America devoid of the cultural contributions of African-Americans would be vastly diminished, unimaginable.\r\n\r\nGershwin knew this and it inspired him to write the greatest and most frequently performed American opera, “Porgy and Bess,” which begins with “Summertime,” one of Gershwin’s greatest tunes.\r\n\r\nThat opera is an ardent homage to African-American culture.\r\n\r\nMy own efforts to do the same don’t amount to much, not alongside those of Gershwin.  But my attempts are no less sincere.  \r\n\r\nVaughan Williams put it so well:  “There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers."\r\n\r\nTo hear one of my own homages to African-American culture, listen to the second movement, “Blues," of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 9, 2017\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),135);

How does a composer know that further tinkering will not improve the piece?\r\n\r\nFascinating questions, the answers to which, including the one I am about to venture, ought to be taken with a grain of salt.  Maybe two. \r\n\r\nBecause … the only experience of Life we have is our own.  Each of us is an island, notwithstanding John Donne’s assertion to the contrary, and we draw our conclusions from what has passed in the tiny island-worlds we inhabit.  We are all Robinson Crusoe; that is why we still read that book, almost 300 years after it was written.  I’ve read it three times.\r\n\r\nVast gulfs separate us.  We are profoundly different from one another.  \r\n\r\nWhen some loud mouth announces that “Deep down we are all the same,” it’s because he wants to sell us something:  a product, a faith, a political allegiance.  How dare such loud mouths presume to know what we are like, deep down?  \r\n\r\nEach of our stories is unique.  The wonder is that we can communicate at all.  Every painting, story and piece of music is a message in a bottle, tossed from another island, washed up on our shore.\r\n\r\nThus, I can only guess how other artists might sense when a work is complete.  \r\n\r\nBut I can tell you authoritatively how I know when my own work is done.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I started, as a boy, “making up stuff” — stories, tunes, ideas — I have partnered with what I can best describe as a voice.  As I worked on creative projects, this voice speaks to me, almost audibly, saying, “Try an F sharp here, delay the punch line there, put in another measure before the climax, add a pinch of dissonance, make it spookier, make it funnier, smooth it out, give that tune to the cello, this part is too obvious, too pat.”  \r\n\r\nI rarely resisted, almost always tried and accepted what was suggested. When I ignored this free advice, the forward momentum of my piece or story would flounder.  The voice reminds me that a piece of music or writing, as it is being newly born, knows where it wants to go.  My task has been to learn to let it go there, to stay out of the way.\r\n\r\nTake these weekly missives you kindly allow me to share.  (Thank you!  I am immensely grateful for the privilege of sharing my life’s work in this way.)  I slap out a rough draft and then re-read and re-write, dozens of times, implementing suggestions from you-know-what.  Yep, that same voice.\r\n\r\nAs I bring to reality a piece of music or writing, the voice makes fewer and fewer suggestions.  When the voice falls silent, when there are no more suggestions, that’s when I know the work is done.  Just now I re-read this message for the last time … and the only peep of advice that came was to add this sentence I am now writing.  \r\n\r\nln my childhood, teens and twenties, I never thought about the source of this voice.  I took it for granted.  In my thirties, reading about Carl Jung’s thoughts on these matters, I began to understand my experience in a new way.\r\n\r\nIn creative work, at least in mine, there is an extra-human influence, coming from outside my conscious mind, to which no suitable name can be given because the old name has been soiled by so much ignoble use.  It is the very thing — that other-, extra-, beyond- thing which I have tentatively termed ‘a voice'' -- with which we partner and work.  And, yes, it is the thing we worship, each in our way, implicitly or devoutly, as suits our tastes. \r\n\r\nI felt a peculiar relief, a curious unclenching, when I found this same thought, beautifully expressed, in Odell Shepard’s thoughtful memoir, The Cabin Down the Glen:\r\n\r\n"There is some Power ... that stands waiting to help, to cheer, and to guide us.  I do not care to name it now, for all names are limitations, but I believe that each of the great worships of the world has been addressed to this Power, has been the rediscovery by some direct and penetrative mind of a truth that all right-living people have always dimly known.  When we work against this Power, we fail.  When we try to work without it, we merely exhaust ourselves.  When we work with it, we succeed and fulfill our destiny."\r\n\r\nWhen I set out to write “Sunny Days,“ my first trio for violin, clarinet and piano, I planned a five-movement work; the third was to be a set of variations on a Belo-Russian folksong.  But as I worked on that movement the voice''s suggestions came in a flood and, though I tried to keep the movement concise, it grew longer and longer.  Soon, it was almost as long as the other four movements combined and still the suggestions kept coming.\r\n\r\nFinally, I accepted the inevitable:  this movement was determined, perhaps predestined, to become a separate work, “an island, entire of itself,” to quote Mr. Donne.  \r\n\r\nSo I cast it loose from “Sunny Days” and let it expand even further until it became my Trio #2 for violin, clarinet and piano, a single 15-minute movement, subtitled, "American Variations on Belo-Russian Folksong.” \r\n\r\nTo hear the Verdehr Trio’s exuberant performance, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 22, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),32);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(52,replace(replace('In the Impressionists Gallery of the Cincinnati Art Museum, where I was as a museum guard for eight years, there are two paintings by Alfred Sisley and one by Frédéric Bazille.\r\n\r\nThe Sisleys are tranquil landscapes, a river in the foreground, a village half-way back, a joyful sky rendered in shades of pale green, pink, lavender, cream and dusty blue.\r\n\r\nSisley must have loved “inventing” the sky.  Consider.  As he painted, outdoors, the river and village just sat there before him, unchanging, in no hurry to be captured in paint. But the skies were always changing, leaving him at liberty to devise whatever sky he wanted to fashion above his quiet river and his sleeping village.  He indulged his fancy and concocted some of the most joyful skies ever seen on canvas, at least by the undersigned.\r\n\r\nThe CAM’s painting by Bazille is mysterious and unfinished, like Bazille himself.  A woman sits on a bench at the edge of a garden; a beckoning path recedes into a surprising depth, suggesting undeveloped potential, an unknowable future, a journey only contemplated, never undertaken.  \r\n\r\nThe woman and the bench are transparent; mere outlines; you can see right through them to the garden behind.  Is the painting unfinished or did Bazille intend to indicate only the outline of the woman?  Is she a ghost?\r\n\r\nBazille’s story doesn’t answer these questions; it certainly enriches them.  A painter of great talent, close friends with Monet, Renoir, Sisley, he was killed at the age of 28, heroically leading a charge in the Franco-Prussian War.  \r\n\r\nWhen he painted that strange garden scene he didn’t know that his life would soon be cut short.  When we look at it today, we cannot help imagining that the beckoning path is emblematic of the future he might have pursued, the potential he might have realized; the ghostly figure is perhaps the partner with whom he might have found a lasting fulfillment.\r\n\r\nFor me, despite the garden''s rich greens and robustly colorful flowers, it’s a sad painting, a lament for all the young talents taken away too soon by War and for the veterans who returned but who had lost their way and were never the same.  My father, for one.  \r\n\r\nThe last movement of my Impressionist Suite #2 for reed trio is entitled “Sisley & Bazille: Joyful Skies and a Lament for the Fallen.”\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear Sisley’s joyful skies right off, the closest I could get, musically, to what Sisley expressed so cheerfully in paint.   Exactly two minutes in, the mood shifts from joyful to sad as I try, beginning at 2:30, to put into notes the sense of loss we feel, standing before a soldier''s grave.\r\n\r\nAt 4:15, we lift our eyes from the grave and there, again, is the sky.  Sisley’s sky.  So happy after all, smiling down on us.  And, through our tears, we smile back, in spite of everything.\r\n\r\nTo hear this movement played — perfectly! beautifully! -- by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 29, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nImagine this New Year as a baby posed on its mother’s lap in a painting by Mary Cassatt.\r\n\r\nWhat music for such a moment?  A lullaby, of course.\r\n\r\nInfants need sleep.  We all do, especially these days.  Waking hours are tense and, come night, sleep can be elusive.  A lullaby says, “Sleep.”\r\n\r\nWhen hit the sack I am calmed by thinking about this:  from now on, Cincinnati’s toddlers will be guaranteed a pre-school education thanks to our citizenry having voted to increase our property taxes to pay for it.  \r\n\r\nAmong American cities, Cincinnati has the second-highest rate of childhood poverty.  Last November 8 we did something to turn around that shameful statistic.  We were told that a strong pre-school experience wings the impoverished child upward; the child’s trajectory into the future is aimed higher.  We were told that when positive patterns of learning and social behavior are established early on, the children harvest much more in subsequent school years, preparing them for an ascendant life.   A majority of Cincinnatians saw the sense of these assertions and voted accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am so happy about this, so proud of our city.  We did something unselfish, purely because it was the right thing to do.  We set aside conservative self-interest, the usual knee-jerk antipathy to higher taxes, and we did something great.\r\n\r\nGood for us!  \r\n\r\nIt’s one of the many phenomena that fall well below the national news radar, the sort of thing a friend had in mind when she wrote to say that, despite recent events, she remains "at least somewhat hopeful that we’ll be pulled through by the many people of this country who contribute to their communities each day in quiet ways."\r\n\r\nCan individuals or communities or even large-scale movements slow the devastation that is in store for our state, our country and the world?  The rich and powerful are surely laughing at the prospect of whatever resistance we might muster.  \r\n\r\nFor example, our governor just signed into law a bill forbidding any Ohio municipality the liberty to raise the minimum wage.  Does our state have the power to do that?  Apparently so.  Why would our lawmakers impose such a restriction?  Mask it how they will, it’s only to keep the rich rich, the poor poor and themselves in power.\r\n\r\nStill, if only for the sake of our mental health, we must try to ameliorate new laws like that one (and the far worse national and global catastrophes soon to come) by doing a little good, in a small way, close to home.  It is an alternative to despair, to hugging our belongings while things crumble.\r\n\r\nArtists are particularly powerless before political onslaughts.  Clout-less, they cannot sway.  Wealth-less, they cannot bribe with campaign contributions.  Like any citizen, an artist can protest;  I have done my share of protesting and will soon do plenty more.  \r\n\r\nMainly, artists just do their work, though it rarely makes much sense as a response to the current events of their time.  \r\n\r\nMary Cassatt’s quiet depictions of mothers and infants did nothing to avert the horrors of the century that followed.  The little lullaby I wrote in homage to Miss Cassatt won’t have any effect either.  \r\n\r\nNo mere work of art will swerve the attacks on the vulnerable that are slated to commence in precisely twenty days, nor the concomitant showering of benefits on the most well-off at the expense of tens of millions.  What melody could protect the health of our countrymen or the well-being of our environment?  What tune could put uncorked hatreds back in the bottle?  What song could forestall the coming wars?   \r\n\r\nWars?  He said: “I love war.”  Other people’s children will die, not his.\r\n\r\nStill, listening to my Lullaby, my homage to Cassatt, you might find respite, a temporary unclenching, a beneficial calm, a kind of wakeful sleep.  \r\n\r\nIt may be scant comfort, considering what is coming, but it’s what one artist has to offer.\r\n\r\nTo hear a tender rendering of Mary Cassatt''s lullaby movement from my Impressionist Suite #2, played by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJanuary 1, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne day when I was at my post as a guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, a solid woman approached me with a purposeful stride.\r\n\r\n“Where’s the ART?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Ma’am, you’re in the Asian gallery.  This is where we display the art of Asia.”\r\n\r\n“This is flea market stuff,” she said.  “I wanna see some Art.”\r\n\r\n“You mean paintings?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, that’s right.  Paintings.  Statues.  In other words, Art.”\r\n\r\nHoo boy.\r\n\r\nThat job expanded my horizons.\r\n\r\nDid you know that some museum-goers attach their depreciated chewing gum to furniture, the undersides of drinking fountains and even onto the frames of paintings?\r\n\r\nDid you know that they leave coins on the carved hands, arms, feet and garments of sculptures?\r\n\r\nDid you know they yank open the drawers of Louis XVI-era armoires?  and are at a loss to know what to do when their children climb onto a hand-carved, Victorian-era bedstead?\r\n\r\nNeither did I.\r\n\r\nOne lady, perusing the descriptive paragraph posted alongside a painting, mistook the identification number for a price tag.  “You paid this much for this painting?” she snorted.  “There goes our tax dollars, down the drain, as per usual.”  I assured her that the support the museum enjoyed was entirely private and voluntary.  She gave me a look.\r\n\r\nA man asked me to tell him how to find the nearest restroom.  I did.  Less than a minute later he came marching back with a menacing air.  “You messin’ with me?” he said.  I assured him that had not been my intention.  Abandoning my post, I led him to the restroom.\r\n\r\nA woman sidled up to me and, in hushed tones, said, “Now these are all copies, right?  I mean, they’re not the actual paintings.”\r\n\r\nI assured her that all the art on display was genuine.\r\n\r\n“Oh come on.  Some of these have to be copies.”\r\n\r\nI repeated my assurance.\r\n\r\n“Look,” she said, a little louder.  "This is an art museum, right?  Which means that, somewhere in here, you gotta have the Mona Lisa.  Now it’s gotta be a copy, right?  I mean, you’re not going to tell me that you have the actual Mona Lisa here.”\r\n\r\n“No, Ma’am, I wouldn’t tell you that.”\r\n\r\n“Well then!” she huffed, vindicated, stomping off.\r\n\r\nA family stood before a depiction of St. Sebastian dying, shot full of arrows.  “Look kids,” said the father, solemnly pointing to the painting.  “It’s George Armstrong Custer!"\r\n\r\nAfter seating her tour group of First Graders on the floor at her feet, a docent positioned herself beside Robert Blum’s painting, “The Silk Merchant,” and asked, “Who can tell me where silk comes from?”\r\n\r\nOne little girl waved her hand.  The docent nodded at her.  “It comes from SHEEP!” the girl cried, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“No, sweetheart,” said the docent.  “You’re thinking of COTTON!”\r\n\r\n??\r\n\r\nSuch moments provide the museum guard with an opportunity to practice spiritual discipline, struggling to refrain from rolling his eyeballs or bursting out in laughter.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the guard is surrounded by patient mentors;  to wit, the paintings, silently staring down from the walls.  Dignified, passive, handsome, they have endured human folly, some for centuries.  \r\n\r\nConsider the works of Gustave Caillebotte.  He is the least remembered of the original French Impressionists, perhaps because he valued clarity, precision and muted tones while the rest were busy capturing light with hastily applied brush-strokes and the colors so enjoyed by cherishers of jelly beans.  \r\n\r\nI wrote two suites for reed trio, trying to depict the spirit and character of seven of those painters.\r\n   \r\nThe second movement from my Impressionist Suite #2 evokes the style of Monsieur Caillebotte.

You can listen to music while you are falling asleep but once you’re really asleep, you’re not listening to music anymore!\r\n\r\nWhat other art form does this?  Imagine a poet writing stanzas with the explicit intention of making your eye lids grow heavier and heavier as you read them.  Or a painter wishing to create canvases that elicit somnolence to such an extent that couches, cots and bedsteads must be set up in the galleries where they are exhibited, bedecked with comforters and pillows.  Or a play that deliberately sets out to induce its audience to snore by intermission.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there are boring poems, paintings and plays; none were written with the specific intention of assisting readers, viewers or theatre goers in falling asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen my brothers and I were tiny, grandmother sang us to sleep with a little tune of her own making.  The words were simply, “Doo-lee, doo-lee, doo-lee….” repeated for as long as was needed to dispatch us to the Land of Nod.\r\n\r\nWhen my turn came to sing lullabyes to my own little ones, I sang that tune again, along with “Loch Lomond” and two Shaker folk hymns: “Simple Gifts” and “Love is Little.”\r\n\r\nThe better known lullabyes didn’t serve.  Brahms’ Lullaby is beautiful but it’s a piano piece, not really intended to be sung.  \r\n\r\n“Rock-a-bye Baby” has a lovely tune, but the imagery is troubling.  You don’t think about the lyrics until you are actually singing them to a baby.  If you looked out your kitchen window and saw a neighbor placing an occupied cradle in a treetop, you’d call the police; they would arrest the caregiver on a charge of child endangerment.  Such a stunt would be dangerous on a still day, but the song says that the wind is blowing, or soon will be!   That bough?  It is going to break; the lyrics leave no room for doubt.  The song doesn’t say “if the bough breaks.”  No.  It is quite clear on that point.  It says “when the bough breaks.”  Folks, that cradle is destined to take the plunge.  “Down will come baby, cradle and all.”  This is a lullaby?  Are you kidding me?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the tune belies all this, rendering the images tongue-in-cheek, even dreamlike.  A good tune can do that, working a sea-change on the lyrics.  The treetop seems hazy, like foliage rendered by Monet.  The wind ineffably gentle.  The baby’s predestined descent will take place, we feel assured, in slo-mo, very slo-mo.  Gravity notwithstanding, we know that the baby will be perfectly safe.\r\n \r\nIn 2002, my graphic artist friends Randy and Michelle Wright asked me to write a lullaby for their newborn daughter, Kara.  If you have my CDs, you’ve seen Randy’s work; he designs my CDs and also my books.  \r\n\r\nA lover of the cello, Rand asked that the piece be scored for cello and piano.  Interestingly, a few nights after I received this request, as I was falling asleep, a lullaby-like tune came to me.  It was still in my head the next morning so I used it as the opening melody of the piece.  \r\n\r\nIt’s followed by a contrasting middle section, beginning at 2:40, evoking the sleepy Old South as imagined by Yankees like myself, who have seen "Gone With The Wind” a time or two.   The Antebellum South, when life was slow and easy, at least for the aristocrats, as always.  And sleep was deep.  That’s the fantasy; let us suspend our revisionist impulses for a bit and honor it for what it is:  a fantasy, yes, but a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nRandy and Michelle, with little Kara in tow, were present when the piece was premiered.  She crooned and chortled as the piece was played before an otherwise silent audience.  Her contribution was the perfect, non-musical touch and the audience loved it.\r\n\r\nTo hear cellist Jeff Schoyen and pianist Phil Amalong perform "Lullabye for Kara,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 4, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),84);

Five years after my high school graduation, I married her daughter, after which Mrs. Ackerman became the best (and only) mother-in-law I ever had.\r\n\r\nShe was hugely entertaining in class but also very demanding.  For one, she made us memorize poems, something I had never done.  One was this poem by Lord Byron, all about youthful arrogance, impetuosity and love:\r\n\r\nStanzas Written on the Road Between Florence and Pisa\r\n\r\nOh, talk not to me of a name great in story;\r\nThe days of our youth are the days of our glory;\r\nAnd the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty\r\nAre worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.\r\n\r\nWhat are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?\r\n''Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:\r\nThen away with all such from the head that is hoary!\r\nWhat care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?\r\n\r\nO Fame! -if I e''er took delight in thy praises,\r\n''Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,\r\nThan to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover\r\nShe thought that I was not unworthy to love her.\r\n\r\nThere chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;\r\nHer glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;\r\nWhen it sparkled o''er aught that was bright in my story,\r\nI knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.\r\n\r\nMemorizing those stanzas was a steep climb for a kid growing up in rural north central Ohio, but there was no getting around it.  I nailed it and can recite it to this day, fifty years later.  Now that I have a “brow that is wrinkled,” not to mention a “head that is hoary,” I view the poem differently than I did when I was 17.  When I recite it to myself, I think, “Heck.  Lord Byron was dead at 36.  What did he know about wrinkles?  Diddley-squat."\r\n\r\nI’ve memorized quite a few poems.  After I have a poem in my head, it sometimes begins to “sing.”  Before I know it, I’m setting it to music.\r\n\r\nWhen I set Lord Byron’s poem to music, in 1977, I tried to capture its high Romanticism, galloping rhythm and breathless, forward-plunging speed.  The song goes by mighty quickly, clocking in at a little over 90 seconds.  \r\n\r\nByron’s title being a bit of a mouthful, I re-named it, “The Days of Our Glory."\r\n \r\nTo hear baritone Dan Hoy’s strapping rendition of “The Days of Our Glory,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 12, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),113);

In the final song, when the singer offers a farewell kiss that comes like a benediction, singing, “My kiss will give peace now and quiet to your heart…” that’s when the lump forms in my throat and the salty sap starts to seep.\r\n \r\n“Along the River” is a set of seven songs, scored for mezzo, flute, clarinet and piano, connected by instrumental interludes.  The cycle tells a sad, beautiful love story.  Sad story, beautiful music.\r\n\r\nA lonely clarinet solo opens the piece with a tender love theme.  You might recognize it because I later expanded it into another work, “The View from Carew,” which is both a single-movement chamber work for clarinet, cello and piano and also the middle movement of my concerto for clarinet and orchestra.  One of my best themes, it is played by all three instruments at various times throughout “Along the River,” though it never appears in the vocal part.  \r\n\r\nA very long time ago, my girlfriend (who, next month, will have been my wife for 44 years) shared with me a wonderful cycle of poems entitled, “Chamber Music” by James Joyce.  Don’t be frightened!  This is the young James Joyce, the youthful genius who gave us “Dubliners” and “A Portrait of the Artist as  Young Man,” not the later, half-mad literatus who conferred “Ulysses” and “Finnegan’s Wake” upon a still baffled world. \r\n\r\nThe poems are written from a man’s point of view, yet I have cast them here to be sung by a woman.  For me, the woman is reading (singing) the man’s love poems back to him, as if to say, “Listen to yourself!  Hear what you sound like!  Understand how you come across!”  Viewed this way, the poems reveal clues as to why the relationship failed.  The woman “explains” this to the man as she says goodbye, using his own words, which are very beautiful and very overwrought.  One can see how she grew weary of such an ardent, needy and loquacious lover.  \r\n\r\nWhat are her feelings?  The music itself is the only hint.  Her feelings, a mingling of sorrow and relief are implied by the way she sings these poems, the way the words are set to music.\r\n\r\nThe seven poems I chose from “Chamber Music” (see below) tell the story, starting out naively happy, gradually darkening, ending in separation and farewell.\r\n\r\nExcept, not quite!  The long piano solo after the soprano finishes her last song, ends the cycle with resignation, yes, but also a wistful radiance.  “Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.”  \r\n\r\nAt the very end, the clarinet repeats a fragment of the naively happy ''springtime'' theme that begins the cycle, as if to say, “The possibility of Love is always present; Love may come again, even to the broken-hearted.”  \r\n\r\n“Along the River” was written for and is dedicated to mezzo soprano Diane Haslam.\r\n\r\nYou are among the few to have heard this beautiful music; the piece has been performed only about a half dozen times.   \r\n\r\nTo hear "Along the River” sung exquisitely and with delicate fervor by Mary Elizabeth Southworth, with flutist Danielle Hundley, clarinetist Marianne Breneman and pianist Phil Amalong (when the four of them perform together, they call their ensemble, “Conundrum,”) click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoems from “Chamber Music” by James Joyce, in the order in which they appear in “Along the River":\r\n\r\nI.

I would in that sweet bosom be\r\n     (O sweet it is and fair it is!)\r\n     Where no rude wind might visit me.\r\n     Because of sad austerities\r\n     I would in that sweet bosom be.\r\n\r\n     I would be ever in that heart\r\n     (O soft I knock and soft entreat her!)\r\n     Where only peace might be my part.\r\n     Austerities were all the sweeter\r\n     So I were ever in that heart.\r\n\r\nIII.

I do?  I had to think.  Ohio strikes me as The Land of Missed Opportunities.  Greatness has often seemed almost within our grasp, but we lose heart, take the narrow view, opt for short-term gains, settle for less.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, when I heard a presidential candidate say, “Ohio is an amazing state!’ I thought, “So the claims are true; this candidate really is a liar.”  I’ve lived in Ohio all my life and the only thing about present-day Ohio that amazes me is Serpent Mound.  \r\n\r\nOhio was once an amazing place.  Just over two centuries ago Ohio was the greatest hardwood forest on the planet, intact since the retreat of the glaciers.  All gone, long since.  The settlers shaved the state bare.  If they had had the foresight to let the forest remain in just one county or even just one township — which is to say, just one 36 square mile area — that would be an amazing resource for study, discovery and appreciation, a world-class tourist attraction.  But no.  For short-term gain, they destroyed it ALL.\r\n\r\nToday Ohio is pleasant enough for the middle class and up.  But amazing?  No.\r\n\r\nDo I love Ohio?  It’s been my home, all my life.  It seems churlish not to say I love it.  \r\n\r\nI suppose we look upon our city, state and country with the same feelings we harbor, in old age, remembering our parents.  They were flawed, they got a lot wrong.  Yet we loved them and cherish their memory … because, we conclude, they did the best they could.  Some things they got right.\r\n\r\nMay our own children be as charitable in their summaries of us.\r\n\r\nOne small thing America got right was the song, “Shenandoah.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I’m asked, "What''s your favorite song?,” I answer, “Shenandoah.”  \r\n\r\nI’ve loved “Shenandoah” since I first heard it when I was 12, in Max Steiner’s score for “How The West Was Won.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was 23, I made the first of many hikes on the Appalachian Trail in the Shenandoah National Park.  \r\n\r\nThe Appalachian Trail is a thing America got right.  Another thing America got right was the amazing idea that there should be national parks.  Next month our great National Park Service will mark the hundredth anniversary of its founding.  That’s something to celebrate!\r\n	\r\nWhen I was 32, my wife and I, mindful of the song and the park, named our daughter Shenandoah.  \r\n\r\nStill later, we learned the meaning of this ancient, Native American word:  “Clear-eye’d Daughter of the Stars.”  That was how they described what we call Shenandoah river.  You have to admire a culture that could come up with a phrase like that one.\r\n  \r\nWhen I was 41, I wrote my Fantasia on “Shenandoah," for string quartet, paying homage to our most beautiful American folksong.  \r\n\r\nNow I’m 66 and technology has developed to the point that I can share this music with you.  For free!  And so easily!  \r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, when I wrote this music, I could not have conceived of sharing my work so readily.  Who came up with this whole electronic rigamarole that allows us such a privilege?  I don’t know their names but I know that they were Americans.  Ingenious Americans.  That’s something else to to celebrate this Fourth of July weekend:  our amazing capacity for innovation.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Shelburne String Quartet playing my Fantasia on “Shenandoah,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the full score for my Fantasia on “Shenandoah,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 19, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),136);

Do we mean to imply that other kinds of music “ain’t got no class?"\r\n\r\nFor some, the very notions of “Fine arts” and “Classical music” ring false.  Folk art and popular music can sometimes be very fine indeed.  \r\n\r\nTake dear old Grandma Moses.  Was she not a fine artist?  \r\n\r\nThink of Stephen Foster, J.P. Sousa, Scott Joplin, Louis Armstrong, Jerome Kern, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Pete Seeger, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon.  Their best works are classics …. and classy, too!\r\n\r\nOh, I know the definitions of these terms.  If “Fine” and “Classical” imply exclusivity, it’s  an accident of semantics.  Still, I wish we could come up with a better term for what we call “classical” music.  I’ve tried and failed.  Seemingly, no one else has succeeded either.  We suspect the term puts off potential listeners, but we’re stuck with it, I fear.\r\n\r\nThere is a legitimate warning here:  When we narrow our sensibilities, as when we categorize some things “classical” or “fine," we imperil our openness to and understanding of expressions that we can’t readily categorize.\r\n\r\nA cultivated friend, aware of this danger, told me, “If ever I write my autobiography, I am going to title it:  ''Impaired by Snobbery.’” \r\n\r\nHa!  The reason that’s funny is because we know that my friend “isn’t the only sucker in town.”  We’re all hobbled by snobbery, one way or t’other.  It’s comes with being human.\r\n\r\nThe Tao Te Ching warns against this, implicitly urging us to see through the fallacies we erect.\r\n\r\n	"When people see some things as beautiful,\r\n	other things become ugly.\r\n	When people see some things as good,\r\n	other things become bad.”\r\n\r\nWe instinctively organize everything into opposites.  Beautiful vs. ugly.  Good vs. bad.  Right vs. Left.  To name a few.  It’s useful, short-term, but it’s a childish way of looking at the world. \r\n\r\nOne of my oldest friends, Dick Ferrell, whom I’ve known since I was eleven years old, wrote a delightful little poem satirizing our tendency to reduce everything to opposites, coaxing us to move beyond that way of thinking … simply by hiking.\r\n\r\n\r\n	Hither and Yon\r\n\r\n	I''ve been to Hither many a time,\r\n	But I''ve never been to Yon.\r\n	I think I''ll travel there sometime.\r\n	I''ll wake up with the dawn.\r\n	I''ll lace my boots,\r\n	And grab my hat,\r\n	I''ll put my backpack on\r\n	And prob''ly be ''bout halfway there\r\n	Before they know I''m gone.\r\n\r\n	Have you ever wanted to visit a place\r\n	With a name like To or Fro?\r\n	Or If or When, or This or That,\r\n	Or maybe High or Low?\r\n	Or These or Those,\r\n	Or Now or Then\r\n	Or maybe Fast or Slow?\r\n	It''s such an easy thing to do.\r\n	Just get up and go.\r\n\r\nListening to music, we’ve often ‘hiked'' through and beyond the opposites of that art form ... loud-soft, fast-slow, major-minor, high pitch-low pitch.  These examples are purely musical, but music is also rich with stylistic opposites.  “Classical” vs. “Popular,” for instance.\r\n\r\nIn my music I often attempt a reconciliation of musical opposites, but also of stylistic opposites, seeing what happens when the gestures of disparate genres, such as “Classical” and “Popular” are juxtaposed.\r\n\r\nAmerican composers have a knack for this.  It is one of the blessings of living in a democracy, but no one, to my knowledge, explored that set of possibilities before Charles Ives (1874-1954).  Ives pioneered the reconciliation of popular music and classical music by mixing Civil War songs, hymns, band music and ragtime into his symphonies and sonatas.   That’s partly why Ives, for my money, is our greatest American composer and one of my heroes.\r\n\r\nOthers pushed further yet, exploring this impulse to reconcile musical gestures that had seemed hopelessly disparate;  Gershwin blended elements of jazz into a rhapsody, a concerto and a tone poem;  Copland built two of his ballets on cowboy songs and, in another, rendered world-famous the Shaker folk-hymn “Simple Gifts.”  Another example is Bernstein’s orchestral suite of the music he wrote for the Broadway musical, “West Side Story.”\r\n\r\nIn the music of those composers, the Popular and the Classical are presented simultaneously, each enriching the other, as opposites do when skillfully and satisfyingly reconciled.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me — at last! -- to the music I want to share with you today, my Variations on a Hiking Song for solo piano.  The theme is the well-known tune, “The Happy Wanderer.”  You know it, don’t you?  The chorus goes:  "Val-de-ree, val-de-rah!”  \r\n\r\nBut the variations are not exactly on “The Happy Wanderer.”  In fact, that tune is never actually heard, as such.  Instead the piece begins (and ends) with the bare, skeletal outline of the tune.  It’s pared down so much that it’s almost unrecognizable.  You’ll have to listen carefully to realize that the source of the lean, spare theme that opens the piece is “The Happy Wanderer.”\r\n\r\nMy idea was to reduce the tune to its barest minimum at the beginning, and again in the final variation, and then, in between, to ‘flesh out’ the skeletal tune through variations that alternate, more or less, between the Popular style and the Classical style.  \r\n\r\nThe music swings back and forth between those two supposedly opposing styles, even going to extremes, invoking the clichés of Popular music in one variation followed by an elegant “Classical” expression in the next.  \r\n\r\nThe distinctions between the two stylistic worlds are increasingly blurred as the piece goes on; gradually the music becomes ambiguous.  Are the later variations intended to be Popular or Classical? ironic or sincere? a parody or an homage?  \r\n\r\nBut there is no doubt at the end.  The final variation, a Requiem, is heartfelt, touching and sincere.  It’s like a benediction; it brings closure to the piece.  \r\n\r\nWhy did I end a delightful piece with a Requiem?  Because the piece was composed in 1992, in memory of my father, Richard Sowash, who died in 1991.  \r\n\r\nTo hear my friend Phil Amalong give a marvelous rendition of my Variations on a Hiking Song, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 17, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),85);

Come Fall, I landed my first full-time job, as Music Director at First English Lutheran, the largest Lutheran church in Mansfield, the county seat.\r\n\r\nThe pastor was demanding.

At least, that’s what I thought for several years.\r\n\r\nHowever, when our services, for a while there, stretched longer and longer past noon, there was some good-natured grumbling.

So, are you a singer?"\r\n\r\nHer school was hosting me, for one day, as a Visiting Author.  \r\n\r\nAn author?  \r\n\r\nWell, yes.  I’ve written several books about Ohio for older elementary school children.  Books about Ohio’s heroes, animals, geography, folk lore.  Schools sometimes invite me to be a Visiting Author.  \r\n\r\nI’m a One Day Wonder!\r\n\r\nI present assemblies, I host a “Lunch with the Author” for the school’s best student-writers, I spend happy half-hours with each of the older grade-levels, trying my best to inspire the kids by revealing “the secret tricks that writers know” so that they can have the fun I have, the fun of "putting pictures into other people’s brains."\r\n\r\nMusic focuses kids'' attention.  I punctuate my instruction with improvisations on the piano or funny little tootles on my soprano recorder.  \r\n\r\nComposing, my true calling, is not part of my Author’s Visits.  Not even the teachers know that I have put far more creative energy into composing music than writing books … unless they read about it on my website, as this teacher had done.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can sing, yes,” I told the teacher.  "I sing tenor in my church''s choir.  But I am not a soloist and I don’t sing on the CDs you saw on my website."\r\n\r\n“So then, if you’re not singing, are you playing the piano on those CDs?”\r\n\r\n“No. I get musician friends to play the music on my CDs.  They play better than I do.”\r\n\r\n“But what songs do they play?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s my music but they’re not songs; they’re instrumental pieces.  It’s chamber music.”  \r\n\r\n"So it''s mostly cover songs, then?”\r\n\r\nUnintentionally, I gave her a look.  She wasn’t getting it.\r\n\r\n“No.  I wrote the music.  The tunes are original.  I chose the harmonies; I decided which instruments would play what.”\r\n\r\n“But if you’re not performing on these CDs then why is your name on the covers?”\r\n\r\n“Because I’m the composer.  You know, like Beethoven?  I wrote the music.”\r\n\r\nShe still didn’t get it.  She nodded, then changed the subject.\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t stupid.  There are many intelligent, educated Americans who don’t grasp what it means to be a composer.  Author?  Painter?  Yes.  Composer?  Not so much.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?  We are a nation of music lovers but most of the music we love did not come to us from American classical composers.  It came from performers, improvisers, singer/songwriters.\r\n\r\nBeing both an author and a composer has allowed me to experience, first hand, how much Americans’ attitudes and assumptions differ regarding those two artistic professions.\r\n\r\nI’ve experienced the discrepancy many times.  The passenger next to me on the airplane asks that classic American question, “What do you do?”\r\n\r\nIf I say, “I’m an author,” he lights up and asks about my books. \r\n\r\nBut if I say, “I’m a classical composer,” he’s at a loss.  Pause.  Sometimes a stranger will come back with, “Oh, then where do you teach?”  When I tell him that I don’t teach music, that I have never taught music, I just write it … bewilderment sets in.\r\n\r\nEuropeans know about composers.  In France, I’ve seen parks, streets, schools and even apartment buildings named for classical composers.  Before the Euro, Debussy was featured on the French two-franc note.  Do you think we’ll ever see Aaron Copland’s homely mug smiling up at us from a two-dollar bill?  Me neither.)  In French public spaces there are statues of Berlioz, Chopin, Gounod, et al.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, in all of America there are only two statues of composers and, strictly speaking, neither of those two musical geniuses were composers; they were song-writers.  There’s the statue of George M. Cohan on Times Square and a statue of Stephen Foster here in Cincinnati’s Alms Park.  \r\n\r\nIn all of America, there is exactly one George Gershwin Elementary School.  Where? You’d guess NYC?  Nope.  Chicago.  Go figure.\r\n\r\nThere Is a Samuel Barber Road in Jackson, Georgia.\r\n\r\nI’m not complaining, mind you.

We borrow the notion from the heights of things in our everyday world.  Some things are high, like the top of our refrigerator, which my petite wife has never seen.  (Good thing; it’s very dusty up there, a disgrace, really; I mean to do something about it, once of these days.)  \r\n\r\nOther things are low, like shoes (the only item of our clothing that we can view while being worn, without using a mirror, which is why — as Sherlock knew so well -- shoes tell us so much about the person wearing them; we look down at our shoes and say to ourselves, “See? That’s the sort of person I am!").  \r\n\r\nBut a C-sharp is not any “higher” than a C.  Basses do not sing “lower” than sopranos.  \r\n\r\nMusic isn’t “fast" or “slow" either.  Other than ''chronologically speaking wise'' or in a figurative, musical/architectural sense, a piece of music is not going anywhere; it''s not moving from point A to point B.  Music itself moves not quickly, not slowly, not at all.  Music is moveless.\r\n\r\nYes, we say music is “moving,” we are “moved” by it, ''emotionally speaking wise.''  Another figure of speech.  Faugh.  \r\n\r\nWith the notable exceptions of marching bands, rock-n-rollers and string bass players, musicians almost always perform while seated.  They move only when they take a breath, finger the valves, whack a tom-tom or yank a bow across a string.  \r\n\r\nPhysical motion is not relevant to music, when you think of it, anymore than the temperature of a painting is relevant.  A painting undoubtedly HAS a certain temperature just as seated musicians are undeniably hurtling through space along with the audience and all the rest of us as the earth spins on its axis.  But so what?  \r\n\r\nMusic can be loud, yes.  But “soft” is a term we''ve borrowed from our sense of touch  A pillow is soft.  Why then do we say music is soft vs. loud instead of saying that music is soft vs. hard? \r\n\r\nTo be sure, in a different sense, there is such a thing as “hard” music, like the Haydn piano sonata I had to master in music school.  That was hard, ''technically speaking wise.''\r\n\r\nCuriously, the French express the idea of quiet music with an image borrowed from the sense of taste.  They use “douce,” meaning “sweet.”  Their word for “loud” is “forte,” which means “strong,” and can be applied to flavors as well as biceps.\r\n\r\n''Practically speaking wise,'' even the fundamental terms of music are fraught with potential misunderstandings.  \r\n\r\nFor most people a “key" is an object that is used to unlock a door or start a car.  \r\n\r\nA “note" is a small piece of paper with writing on it.  \r\n\r\nA “bow" shoots arrows.  \r\n\r\nA “snare" catches rabbits.  \r\n\r\nKnives are “sharp.”   Floors are “flat.”  \r\n\r\nA “staff" is what a wizard, if wise, is seldom without.  \r\n\r\nThe English horn is neither … neither English nor a horn.  \r\n\r\nWhat is the frog?  Part of a violin?  Or a tailless amphibian with a short squat body, moist smooth skin, and very long hind legs for leaping?\r\n\r\nWith relief, we turn to the phrase, “music stand.”  Here, for once, are two words from the world of music that mean, ''verbally speaking wise'' almost nothing other than what they indicate,\r\n\r\nI say “almost” because the phrase dimly echoes a question polite Midwesterners (such as the undersigned) would ask more frequently if our regional culture hadn’t rendered us so reluctant to risk seeming to be less than friendly.  Namely, “How can you stand that music?”  \r\n\r\nLet’s see if you can stand the music I hope to share today.\r\n\r\nTo hear Teresa Villani playing the first movement of my Little Suite in G for solo cello, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nMy painter friend Richard Schemm swears this story is true.\r\n\r\nRichard and a friend were out for a walk in Chicago on a windy winter evening when they came upon a ragged, grizzled man seated on the sidewalk, wrapped in a dirty blanket and holding a cardboard sign:  “Homeless Please Help.”\r\n\r\nRichard reached for his wallet but his friend cautioned him.  “Don’t give him anything; he’ll most likely spend it on cigarettes or booze.”\r\n\r\nRichard hesitated.  That was a likely outcome.  \r\n\r\nThen a blast of wind gusted across his face.  Richard pulled a ten dollar bill from his wallet and handed it to the man.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” the man said.  “This money will come back to you!  It will!  You’ll see!”\r\n\r\n“Slim chance of that,” Richard thought.  Aloud, he said, "Glad to help.”\r\n\r\nA year later Richard was back in Chicago, walking in the same neighborhood, alone this time.  Approaching the street corner where he had encountered the ragged man, he remembered the incident.  This time, no man, no sign.\r\n\r\nRichard looked down at the square of sidewalk where the man had been seated.\r\n\r\nAnd there on the sidewalk was … a ten dollar bill.\r\n\r\nI’m not quite sure what this story means.

It was how I played … with blocks, toy soldiers, marbles, costumes, anything.  Really, anything.  There being no toys at my Grandma Sowash’s house, when I stayed there overnight I borrowed her lipstick tubes, boxes of buttons and wooden bobbins, assigned each one a personality and a name and then passed happy hours watching and listening as they ‘talked'' to one another, assembled into formations and undertook battles, quests and adventures.\r\n\r\nEventually I transferred that spirit of play from toys and buttons to musical notes and words.  I ''made up stuff’ sitting at the piano and I ‘made up stuff’ with a pencil, writing stories on pads of bright yellow paper with thin green lines, chronicling the deeds of Rouston S. Clark and General Floucus and other characters I invented.\r\n\r\nIn my teens, my elders pressed me to choose, once and for all, what I “wanted to be when I grew up.”  They said that I must choose between the only two disparate career paths I could envision.  I wanted to be a composer and I wanted to be a writer.  But which?\r\n\r\nRobert Frost was no help at all, standing there in his yellow wood, confronted with two diverging roads, saying he was “sorry I could not travel both."\r\n\r\nSomeone could have spared me a good deal of adolescent angst by informing me that a person CAN "travel both” by becoming more than just one thing.  In defense of those grownups, who loved me and cared about me very much, the notion that a person could be more than one thing was not as commonly accepted fifty years ago as it is today.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Teddy Roosevelt was chief among my boyhood heroes was because he was so many things.  President, author, naturalist, cowboy, soldier, hunter, explorer.  My kind of guy!\r\n\r\nIn college, still unable to choose between the two paths, I tackled a double major:  Music Composition AND Comparative Literature.  It required a fifth year of undergraduate courses.  So be it, said I.  \r\n\r\nAfter college, I returned to Richland County, Ohio, the home of my family for six generations, and set about writing BOTH music and literature.\r\n\r\nBy my mid-twenties the composing was going well and you are kindly allowing me to share  the music I wrote during the four decades that followed.  Thanks.  Your interest in my music means so much to me.\r\n\r\nThe writing did not go nearly as well.  I had not found ‘my’ genre.\r\n\r\nI tried most of the more familiar literary genres.  In my twenties, I wrote a couple dozen poems and two novels:  taken together, they comprise ''a richness of embarrassments.''  I lacked the knack for fiction or poetry.  I tried re-writing one of my novels as a play, without success.  I tried writing lyrics.  Oscar Hammerstein made it seem so easy.  It is not.\r\n\r\nIn my late thirties I began writing non-fiction for 4th- and 5th-graders, books about Ohio history, folklore and animals.  I made a fair amount of money from those books, publishing them myself, marketing them to Ohio schools, but their artistic value is negligible.\r\n\r\nI wrote my best book in my late fifties, my boyhood memoir, “The Boy Who Would Be Famous.”  It’s delightful and I am proud of it.

It’s a literary genre which I seem to have invented:  a weekly blab anchored by a piece of music which I have composed, with links to an mp3 recording and a PDF of the score.  My daughter coined a term for this combination of verbiage, recordings and sheet music:  an “mpFree,” an essay more or less about and accompanied by a piece of my own music. \r\n\r\nAt long last I have found my genre!  All these years, I never knew I was an essayist!  I’m like Molière’s character who is delighted to learn that all his life he’s been speaking in prose!  But then, I never knew that I was a teacher either, until the last couple of years, the same period  during which I’ve written and shared these ‘mpFrees.’  Self-discovery, this late in life.  Who knew?\r\n\r\nWriting these ‘mpFrees'' and teaching various subjects that interest me are activities that still feel, even after four years, very new and exciting to me … and richly rewarding!\r\n\r\nWhy am I sharing these thoughts about writing?  Because, in truth, I have almost nothing to say about the music I want to share with you today.\r\n\r\nIt’s a good piece but it speaks for itself.  \r\n\r\nTo hear Teresa Villani playing the third movement from my Little Suite for Cello, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),29);

I have, once.  \r\n\r\nCould such an experience be expressed musically?\r\n\r\nCould music capture the accompanying elements:  the silence, the stillness, the heat?\r\n\r\nSeemingly not.  \r\n\r\nSilence?  By definition, music must be audible.  It can be very soft, sure.  There can be brief rests between notes, phrases, movements.  But silent?  No.\r\n\r\nStillness?  By definition, music must progress, must seem to ‘go somewhere.’  We are quickly bored by a changeless chord. \r\n\r\nHeat and thirst?  By definition, music reaches us through our ears, unaffected by Fahrenheit or the frequency of fluid intake.\r\n\r\nYet these were precisely what I wanted to express in the first movement of my Trio #3 for violin, clarinet and piano, “Memories of Corsica."\r\n\r\nThe Verdehr Trio, having performed all over the length and breadth of the globe, had asked me write a piece, suggesting that I seek inspiration from exotic places I have visited. \r\n\r\nI asked myself, what places have I visited that could be called exotic?\r\n\r\nThen, I thought:  Corsica!  The scrubby landscape, the sleepy stone villages, the crumbling watchtowers scanning the azure Mediterranean, the pristine beaches, the chestnut forests, the strong wines and cheeses, the spicy salads topped with eggs fried in olive oil, larded with the bacon of wild boars.  \r\n\r\nI remembered the intense, dry heat and my desperate thirst when, foolhardy, I hiked out from Corté, the capital city, into the wild, with a half-bottle of water.  I knew better, but Corsica is a strange, timeless, enchanting place; Corsican bandits were legendary; it’s a place where the banditry of one’s usual good sense is a possibility.\r\n\r\nMy water gone, I ought to have turned back.  But the landscape was thrilling and mysterious, like the Sonoran deserts of Arizona; my curiosity drew me around the bend, around the next, then the next.  \r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt unwell.  A dizzy, ringing head.  A sandy, swollen tongue.  I turned around. There was Corté, further away than I expected.  I started back but my knees weakened and I had to sit down.\r\n\r\nI felt tiny and vulnerable, a speck of humanity, very hot and very dry, my fundament plumped on one small rock amid ranges of jagged mountains, sawtoothed against a harsh and depthless sky.  \r\n\r\nNature?  Beautiful ... and indifferent.  Our predicaments concern her not.\r\n\r\nAbandon me there for a few minutes, seated on a hot slab in the sun-baked Corsican wilderness, while you listen to the Verdehr Trio performing the first movement of my Memories of Corsica, subtitled "Arid Heat.”  \r\n\r\nBe warned:  the music begins VERY quietly.  If your hearing, like mine, is fading, you may not hear any music for several seconds.  Be patient.  The violin and clarinet are melting in and out of one another, quietly intoning a middle C, back and forth between them.  That’s the ceaseless heat of the sun.  Then you’ll hear the pianist playing, in both hands, two octaves apart, a hollow, desolate melody, slow but rising and falling in sharp jerks.  That’s the zig-zagged outline of the moveless mountains.

It means a lot to me.  I hope that one message each week is not too often, lest you find yourself “awash with Sowash."\r\n\r\nI began sharing these weekly messages four years ago by sending them only to fans and friends with whom I had a face-to-face acquaintance, mostly Cincinnatians, all of whom knew how to pronounce my last name.  But the pool of recipients has gradually expanded, resulting in these messages now reaching folks who are at a loss to know how to pronounce my strange last name.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, I mused on the spelling of my curious sur-name and several of you wrote to kindly ask me how it should be pronounced.\r\n\r\nWhen I phone in an order for Chinese carry-out —or Greek, Thai, Indian, Mexican — the name has been variously understood as “Squash,” “Sasquatch,” “OshKosh” even “Sushi."\r\n\r\nWe Sowashes prefer the pronunciation, "SO-wash.”  Accent on the FIRST syllable, please.\r\n\r\nWrongly accenting the second syllable — "so-WASH" — makes it sound like a response to someone complaining about having gotten their hands dirty:  “So? WASH!”  \r\n\r\nOr the slurred inquiry of a half-looped friend:  “So … WASH new wish YOU?"    \r\n\r\nThe name was originally, “Sauvage,” a not uncommon French family name, the name of my French ancestors.  Johannes Sauvage arrived in Boston in 1737 and all Sowashes, what few there are of us, descend from Great-great-grandpa Johannes.  \r\n\r\nWhy would a Frenchman have the Germanic first-name “Johannes?”  Because the family, being Huguenots, fled the persecution of Louis XIV, curse his bones, hightailing it to Holland where, over the next 90 years, they apparently picked up the habit of naming their children with Dutch first-names, such as Johannes.  \r\n\r\n(I curse the bones of Louis XIV for turning a blind eye to the persecution perpetrated on the French Huguenots by their Catholic compeers and for revoking the Treaty of Nantes which had ended the Wars of Religion, promoting religious tolerance in France.  If Louis had been a liberal, I would be living in France.  I’d be French!  Not just Franco-American.  As it is, I take pride in being an American descendent of Huguenots, a distinction I share with Paul Revere and Davy Crockett.)\r\n\r\nThere were Sauvages in the Continental Army, qualifying me to be a Son of the American Revolution if I were attracted to that form of patriotic expression, which I am not.\r\n\r\nAround 1840, my ancestors arrived in western Pennsylvania and began spelling the name “s-o-w-a-s-h,” probably to accommodate their German-speaking neighbors.  In German, you get a “V” sound by writing a “W” -- as in “Wagner.”  To a German ear, “Sauvage” would be spelled “Sowasch.”  Drop the “c” and you arrive at "Sowash."\r\n\r\n"SO-wash" is thus an Americanization of “Sauvage."  \r\n\r\nWe like our names to be correctly pronounced.  Some radio broadcasters, seeing my name in print on the cover of a CD, deduce that it is to be divided down the middle, like this:  Sow + Ash.\r\n\r\nI don’t like it when someone pronounces my name as Sow + Ash because I don’t like having “sow,” a female pig, in my last name.  Nor do I like “ash.” \r\n\r\nWhat is Sow + Ash?  the incinerated remains of a female pig?  burnt bacon?  scorched ham?  sausage cinders?  cremated kielbasa?  \r\n\r\nCome to think of it, didn’t the pioneers use sow ash in the making of soap?\r\n\r\nContrariwise, SO + wash connotes wholesome domestic activities — sewing and washing -- and that’s just fine with me.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, that very phrase shows up in one of Walt Whitman’s most famous and affecting poems, “I Hear America Singing."\r\n\r\n"I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear ….\r\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at\r\n     work, or of the girl sewing or washing…”\r\n\r\nI noticed that when I set the poem to music.\r\n\r\nIt made me shake my head.  The things a composer gets into…\r\n\r\nBy the way, a great many American towns boast a street monikered with my family name.  What?  A street sharing its name with that of an obscure Midwestern composer active before and after the turn of the last century?  Well, sort of ...  \r\n\r\nA multitude of American municipalities have a Washington Street, almost always in the oldest part of town.  Some of these Washington Streets run north-south.  So a town will have a “North Washington Street” and a “South Washington Street.”  You see what’s coming?  Since “South Washington Street” has a little too many letters to squeeze onto a street sign, it’s often abbreviated to … you guessed it … “So.Wash. St.”  \r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nTo hear “Ardent Souls," the third movement of my Trio #3 for violin, clarinet and piano, subtitled “Memories of Corsica,” performed by the Verdehr Trio, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“We have art,” said Picasso, “so that we do not perish from the truth.”\r\n\r\nArt inures us to Truth either by offering an escape from it or by taking us so deeply into it that we can view the outer world from a fresh perspective, vicariously, from inside the Truth, temporarily distanced from its effects.\r\n\r\nP.G. Wodehouse expressed the thought this way:\r\n\r\n	“There are two ways of writing novels.  One is mine, making a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real life altogether; the other is going right down deep into life, and not giving a damn.” \r\n\r\nWodehouse made no bones about it; he offered escape.  Me too, most of the time.  I went ‘down deep’ a time or two and brought back some good stuff which I’ll share someday when the world is less crisis-ridden, when our daily dose of Truth is more tolerable.  The piece I want to share today offers escape.\r\n\r\nWhen the world-traveling Verdehr Trio asked me to write a piece for them, they suggested that I might find inspiration in memories of exotic places I have visited. \r\n\r\nCorsica, I thought!  The jagged mountains, an “Arizona” landscape surrounded by the amazingly blue Mediterranean, the sleepy stone villages, the crumbling watchtowers where Genoan guards kept watch for pirate raids, the pristine beaches, the vast chestnut forests, the peppery wine, the strong, sheep’s milk cheese, the salads laced with the bacon of wild boars, grown fat foraging chestnuts, topped with a hot, fried, fresh egg.\r\n\r\nMy most salient memory of the place is the aroma.  When hot, dry breezes fling about the scents of the herbs that grow everywhere in wild profusion -- oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme -- the scents pervade the island.  Herbs don’t only grow in the Corsicans’ kitchen gardens, mind you, but literally everywhere, wild, right along the road.  Sailors at sea, it is said, can sometimes catch a whiff of that extraordinary fragrance on the breeze, fully forty miles downwind!  Think of it!  To sense the presence of a island, not through the eyes, no!  But through the nose!  \r\n\r\nI’ve wandered that strange, timeless and enchanting island twice, awestruck, for five days both times.  Though I dream of returning, I’ve contented myself so far by reading its sad, noble history.  \r\n\r\nWhen I settled down to write music about that beautiful place I remembered the Corsicans I’d met:  neither French nor Italian, proud, a little fierce, yet quick to laugh.  I remembered the intense, dry heat and my desperate thirst when I foolishly set out on a hike with too little water.  But most vividly, I remembered that fragrance. \r\n\r\nYou can’t smell with your ears any more than you can hear with your nose, but music can offer metaphors for many experiences, even the olfactory ones.  I tried my best to write fragrant music, herbaceous music, tunes and harmonies redolent of herbs.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Verdehr Trio play "Aromatic Breezes," from my Trio #3 “Memories of Corsica” for violin, clarinet and piano (as featured on the CD entitled “Pastorale”) click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),33);

No one was more excited about it than my impetuous roommate, Ben, a freshman piano major.\r\n\r\nThe day after the recital, Ben and I were walking through the Student Union when a tall, balding, bespectacled man came strolling down the hall toward us.\r\n\r\nMy heart stopped as I recognized him.

Jo tended me at all hours; friends visited, bringing meals and good cheer.  \r\n\r\n(Right now, feet up, I’m sitting here with one of my biggest fans.  A three-speed Cool Master.  We got it on sale at Sears.)\r\n\r\nThank you, all!  I am very well-cared for.  \r\n\r\nOops.  Mustn’t end with a preposition.  But if you don’t put it at the end, then where DO you put it?  Put anywhere else in the sentence and you sound like Yoda:  \r\n				"Hmmm!  Very well cared for, I am.” \r\n\r\nWhat did I have to bring that subject I don''t like to deal with up for?\r\n\r\nOops.  Did it again.\r\n\r\nLet’s try this:  Up for what with did I have to bring that subject I don''t like to deal?\r\n\r\nSigh.  \r\n\r\nRules, grammatically-speaking-wise … or ought one to say grammatically-wise-speaking? … \r\n\r\nRules and more rules.  It makes you wonder ... to what is coming the world?\r\n\r\nAll this is by way of demonstrating that the best way I know to keep up one''s spirits is to try to be funny.  What’s funny about losing an entire summer while recovering from surgery?   The truth is I’ve suffered pain, which I expected, but also depression, anxiety, mild hallucinations, the unexpected side effects of the pain-relieving narcotics.  I cannot recall a more difficult summer.\r\n\r\nTo quote Stan Laurel’s last words, I’d rather be skiing.\r\n\r\nJust before he died, Stanley told his nurse he would rather be skiing.  The nurse said, "Are you a skier, Mr Laurel?"  He replied, "I''m not, but I''d rather be doing that than having these needles stuck in me.”  A few minutes later he died, exiting with a joke.  \r\n\r\nMy only joke about this second knee replacement is that I will never have to go through this again owing to the fact that by a lucky chance I happen NOT to have been born with three knees.  \r\n\r\nMy hospital stay was no fun at all, though it might have been. I had planned all sorts of shenanigans.\r\n\r\nI was going to knot my sheets and drape them out the open window; then hide in the bathroom, leaving the door open just a crack so that I could watch all the fun that would ensue when the nurse found my bed empty and knotted sheets hanging out the window.\r\n\r\nI was going to surreptitiously place a half-inch segment of spaghetti up my nose, just out of sight, and then, with the nurse watching, blow it out into a tissue and display it, explaining that I’ve been experiencing a "sort of a noodle-y feeling" in my nose all morning and suggesting that it be sent to the lab for assessment. \r\n\r\nI was going to ask the Candy Striper to take the jello of my lunch to the good-looking female patient who had caught my eye in the room across the hall, with instructions to explain that the jello had been sent over by the old guy in #503.  Then, when she looked my way, I was going to give her a big smile and a wave and call out, “Hi-ya, toots!  Hope ya like jello!"\r\n	\r\nI was going to bring along a bit of string and when no one was looking, tie one end around my ear, inserting the other end into the corner of my mouth.  Then, when the nurse came to check on me, I was going to wait until she noticed it and then, snap! before she could inquire, I was going to give her a baleful look and grumpily demand to know, "How long do I have to keep this damn string in my mouth?"\r\n\r\nI was going to hide one of those brittle plastic drinking cups under my armpit, out of sight, inside my pajamas, and then, when the doc came in, ask, “Doc, do you think this is normal?" and, real quick, take my jaw in one hand and the back of my head in my other hand and then give my neck a sharp, chiropractic twist, crushing the cup under my armpit while doing so.  When demolished in this way, a plastic cup makes a horrendous crunching sound which, being somewhat muffled under my armpit and pajamas, convincingly sounds as if it''s coming from my insides.  I know of what I speak.  I’ve pulled this trick many a time, usually at picnics, though never at a hospital.  It would have been fun.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, during my twenty-seven hour stay at the hospital, I was almost completely ‘out of it.''  I didn’t get to do anything fun.\r\n\r\nI can’t pull stuff like that here at home.  Jo knows all my tricks.  I’m just going to have to hold off until the next time I have to be in a hospital, if I ever I do, which hopefully I won’t have to.  Oops.  Darn.  There I go again.  Perorating with a preposition.  I guess I should say, "Hopefully, to have I won’t."\r\n\r\nLet’s listen to some funny music.  Or lively anyway.  Listen for the quotation from Handel’s Hallelujah Chorus at 3:11, “and He shall reign forever and ever.”  \r\n\r\nTo hear “Peasant Dance” from my Spring Fever Suite for two cellos, both parts played by Teresa Villani, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	My Sunday morning ‘e-pistles’ have been mighty serious of late.  \r\n\r\n	Today, a funny story.\r\n\r\n	The music I want to share today is ‘about’ daffodils (insofar as music can really be ‘about’ anything).  I love daffodils and have enjoyed them immensely these past few weeks.  \r\n\r\n	I just don’t have much to say about them.  I could quote Wordsworth, note that they are pretty and cheerful, a sure sign of Spring, all that.  I could observe that a daffodil, like a good piece of music, doesn''t need explaining.  \r\n\r\n	Lao Tzu says: \r\n\r\n		“Those who know don’t talk.  \r\n		Those who talk don’t know.”  \r\n\r\n	And where does he say that?  In his great book the Tao Te Ching, which is five thousand words long.  What a blabbermouth!\r\n\r\n	Instead, let''s turn our thoughts to Green Lake, Wisconsin!  \r\n\r\n	Ah, such a lovely place!  \r\n\r\n	Among its other charms, it’s the home of the Green Lake Festival of Music at which I was once the featured composer for a week.\r\n\r\n	The Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) made the festival their summer home and finagled an invitation for me to be among the festival''s ‘visiting artists.''. \r\n\r\n	A young composer, in my early thirties, I was thrilled.  I was invited to present a talk or two, rehearse the musicians, my music would be performed, I would take a few bows, hang out, schmooze, “confer, converse and otherwise hobknob,” (as the Wizard of Oz says), with my fellow musicians.  \r\n\r\n	A good time would be had by all.\r\n\r\n	The only fly in the ointment was the sleeping arrangements.  I was assigned to a room in an old wooden structure, a sort of barracks that had served as sleeping quarters for summer camp attendees in years gone by.  There were two twin beds in the room;  one for me and one for the Mirecourt Trio’s fiddler, Kenny Goldsmith.\r\n\r\n	It was OK with me.  I’m a Boy Scout, used to sharing a tent.  I liked Kenny, a brilliant violinist with abundant enthusiasm for my music.\r\n\r\n	Kenny and I unpacked our things, chose which bed would be ours, then went downstairs to socialize until the wee hours with the other musicians, telling stories, laughing and at last ascending to our room.\r\n\r\n	We jumped into our jammies and hit the sack.  I set a course for the Land of Nod.  \r\n\r\n	After what seemed only a few minutes I was abruptly awakened by a hideous performance, a combination of violent crunching, vigorous sawing, impassioned gasping and porcine oinking.  \r\n\r\n	It was Kenny, snoring.  \r\n\r\n	I tossed and turned all night.  There was no sleeping with that racket going on.  Kenny was seventeen years older than myself and I had enormous respect for him.  He was awe-inspiring.  It didn’t seem proper for a fledgling composer such as myself, to get up, shake the great musician’s shoulder and issue a shouted entreaty that he stop snoring.  He wasn’t doing it on purpose, after all. \r\n\r\n	That night, I slept not at all, or so it seemed.  When I opened my eyes, sunlight was streaming in the window and Kenny’s bed was empty.  I figured he must be down the hall, taking a shower.\r\n\r\n	I went downstairs in desperate need of coffee.  Steaming mug in hand, I sat down at a table across from clarinetist Russ Harlow, another ‘visiting artist,’ who promptly opined, “You look terrible.”\r\n\r\n	“I feel terrible,” I said.  “I didn’t sleep a wink all night.  Kenny snores.”\r\n\r\n	“Oh, that doesn’t have to be a problem,” he said.  “There’s an easy solution.  When I was with the Utah Symphony, we toured Europe and I had to share a hotel room every night with another musician who snored like the dickens.  But all I had to do -- and all you have to do -- is snap your fingers three or four times and he’ll stop on a dime.  Or you can whistle, like this.”  He let out a series of short, sharp whistling sounds.  “Nothing to it.  Works every time.”\r\n\r\n	“Good to know!” I said.  “Duly noted!” and thanked him for this valuable inside information.\r\n\r\n	I didn’t see Kenny much that next day and when I climbed upstairs to our room he was already in bed, asleep.  I jumped into my jammies, curled up under my blanket and fell into the arms of Morpheus.  \r\n\r\n	After what seemed, again, like a very short time, Kenny began another performance, as fierce and fervid as the night before.  I snapped my fingers four or five times and he immediately stopped snoring.  \r\n\r\n	Some time later he was snoring again.  This time, for variety, I let out a series of short, sharp whistles.  Once again, boom, he stopped.  Silence.  I fell back asleep.\r\n\r\n	I slept pretty well that second night and the next morning I was up and at ‘em, early.  Kenny being still asleep, I quietly slipped out of the room, had my shower, and descended in my robe to the dining hall.  \r\n\r\n	An hour or so later, I was sitting at the table with some other musicians, chatting over coffee, when Kenny entered the room.  He looked terrible.  He approached our table, staring at me with a wild, intense look.  \r\n\r\n	I was going to say, “You look terrible,” but before I could form the words he pointed at me and exclaimed, “You are a TRUE and TOTAL composer!  Even in your SLEEP, you’re snapping your fingers, you’re whistling motifs!  You’re composing in your SLEEP, for God’s sake!  I couldn’t sleep a wink all night!”\r\n\r\n					* * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nTo hear “Daffodils” from my Spring Fever Suite for two cellos, both parts played by Teresa Villani, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),45);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(62,replace(replace('When I was a Boy Scout, I figured out that there are two good reasons to volunteer to do the cooking on a campout.  First, you can fix the food the way YOU like it to be cooked.  Second, you don’t have to clean up;  you can say, “OK, you guys, I cooked, now you wash the dishes.”  They''ll grumble, but they’ll do it.\r\n\r\nI love to cook.  I love everything about it.  My favorite spatula, our dear old cast iron skillet, the Japanese knife my son gave me for Christmas, our colorful porcelain Provençal olive oil dispenser, our brass pepper mill, my Kelly-green apron.  Searching out the recipes, buying the groceries at historic Findlay Market and at Avril’s, Cincinnati''s great downtown butcher shop.  I love the cooking, the serving, even the clean up (which I  do nowadays, there being no Scouts handy).  \r\n\r\nOur kitchen is tiny.  When our pastor, a Texan, visited our apartment and saw our kitchen, she put her hands on her hips, shook her head and said, “Wall!  This here’s what we call a one-ass kitchen.”  She had it right.\r\n\r\nA kitchen is best judged by the quality of the food that comes out of it.  Jo is tired of hearing me say that.  She yearns for “a nice kitchen” like the one we had in our first home as newlyweds, back in Bellville, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nIt was a sweet place.  We still refer to it as The Little Yellow House.  The rooms were small, but the kitchen was big enough to accommodate two or more persons without unduly frequent bumpings of bums, hips and elbows.\r\n\r\nWe loved that house.  We could hardly believe it was ours.  It seemed to us that it must belong to someone else:  serious, grownup people; not a couple of goofy kids like us.  When we painted a room, we said, “Whoever REALLY owns this house might be shocked by the new colors we’ve chosen.”  \r\n\r\nIn those days, we were taken with the watercolors of the Swedish painter Carl Larsen.  He depicted the rooms of his home, showing his family doing ordinary things -- watering house plants, reaching for a utensil, setting the table.  Charmed, we bought prints of his paintings, framed them, hung them on the walls of our home.  \r\n\r\n"Our home!”  For us, in those days, it was a thrill to use that phrase. \r\n\r\nI decided to try something like what Carl Larsen had done, to use our home as a subject matter, not for paintings but for a piece of music.\r\n\r\nIn 1978 I wrote a suite in seven movements, one for each room of the house, each movement expressing the character of that room.\r\n\r\nThe first movement, entitled “The Kitchen,” is bubbling and merry.\r\n\r\nI scored the work for flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon and invited friends to our home to play and listen to the premiere.  “Chamber” music, indeed!\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a saxophonist friend, Bill Perconti, re-scored the work for saxophone quartet.

The sweetness and sincerity of these paintings captured our fancy.  \r\n\r\nI suggest you google “Carl Larsen home paintings” and look at the images.  Delightful.\r\n\r\nWe bought prints of his paintings, had them framed and hung them in most of the seven little rooms of ’our little yellow house,’ as we’ve always called it.  \r\n\r\nLarsen inspired me to try something similar as a composer:  to use the rooms of our home as a subject matter for music.  That’s how the suite “Our Home” came to be.\r\n\r\nThe music for The Kitchen is bubbling and merry, The Composing Room is a careful canon, The Attic is quiet and thoughtful, The Dining Room quotes Shaker hymns, The Bedroom is a lullabye and/or a romantic love song and The Living Room is lively, a place of bustling jollity.  \r\n\r\nThe suite is friendly, fetching and naive (not unlike ourselves back then, in 1978 and, I hope, even still today).  We invited musician to premiere the work for a tiny audience of friends, playing the piece in the very rooms the music depicted.  \r\n\r\n“Chamber” music, indeed!\r\n\r\nI scored the suite for flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon;  later, a clarinetist transcribed the suite for clarinet quartet;  a few years ago Bill Perconti transcribed it for saxophone quartet and recorded it.\r\n\r\nYou’re invited to listen to Bill and his friends in the Alloy Saxophone Quartet playing the final movement, "The Living Room,” from the suite Our Home by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 5, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“For this article, I’d like to get a photo of you in your studio,” said the free-lance writer, telephoning me to set up an interview.\r\n\r\nI laughed.  “Studio?  I have no studio.  I don’t even have a piano.”\r\n\r\nI told him:  "I’ve made up tunes in all sorts of circumstances, by humming and whistling while driving my car, while soaking in the tub, while on duty as a guard at the art museum.  If I come up with something interesting, I pencil a few notes on a scrap of paper so that I can recover it after I’ve forgotten it.  I throw the scraps in a drawer.  It’s a little mine of musical fragments.  Sometimes I open it and ‘pan for gold.’  If I find something that seems to want to be developed, I set up my computer and electronic keyboard on our dining room table and that’s where I do the notation work.  I have no studio."\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, though, I did have something like a studio.  Many years ago, back in the ’70’s, in our tiny first home, there was a half-finished section of attic with just enough room for the miniature harpsichord I had back then, along with a table, a chair and a shelf of reference books.  \r\n\r\nWe called it “The Composing Room” because that room was where I retreated to do the work of composing, notating music by hand.  Composers had no computers in those days, no “Finale" music notation programs;  all my early scores were hand-written in the neat calligraphy I had learned in college.  \r\n\r\nI remember my composition professor telling us, “No computer will ever be able to do music notation;  it’s far too complicated.”\r\n\r\nTwenty years after he told us that I bought “Finale” and undertook the vast task of transcribing all my hand-written scores into computer notation, generating scores that are far more professional in appearance than any I had written by hand. \r\n\r\nIn 1978 I wrote a suite for flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon entitled, “Our Home,” depicting each of the rooms in our tiny first house.  For the movement entitled “The Composing Room,” I fashioned a composer-ly display of rounds.\r\n\r\nYou know what a round is?  Think “Row, row, row your boat.”  One singer begins the tune, a second begins the same tune but a bit later, a third a bit after that, etc.  \r\n\r\nRounds are easy to learn and fun to perform but tricky to write because they have to be fashioned so as to ensure that when all the parts are simultaneously singing different sections of the same tune they still sound good together.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the round was a major leap in musical consciousness, as important to the development of music as the Renaissance discovery of perspective was to the development of art. \r\n\r\nNo one knows who made up the first round.  Before rounds, people sang, of course, but only in unison, we suppose.  Then one day ….\r\n\r\nI picture a scene such as Breugel might have painted, pot-bellied peasant louts in a tavern, rowdily singing.  One of them is so drunk that he starts singing the same tune as everyone else, only two bars too late.  And what do you know?  It works!  It sounds good!  Voilà!\r\n\r\nWhere did this happen?  Maybe in England.  The English round "Sumer Is Icumen In” (Summer is a-comin’ in) may be the earliest, dating from the mid-13th century.\r\n\r\nA hundred years later comes an Italian vocal form, a round for two voices with a text describing the hunt.  The name for this form was “caccia” — Italian for “hunt.”  It makes sense because one voice is, in effect, chasing the other voice, the way a hunter chases his prey, hard upon its heels. \r\n\r\nTwo hundred years later comes the English “catch," a 17th-century type of round, which may derive its name from “caccia.”  Again, one voice is pursuing, trying to ‘catch’ the other.\r\n\r\n“Will you troll the catch you taught me?” asks Caliban in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.”\r\n\r\nStephano replies, “At thy request, monster … Come, let us sing."\r\n\r\nRounds, rounds and more rounds.  Seven hundred “Sumers” after “Sumer Is Icumen In," we’ve not tired of them.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a saxophonist friend, Bill Perconti, re-scored “Our Home" for saxophone quartet.

I try to do my part.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to share today is just silly.  \r\n\r\nBut first, a disclaimer:  \r\n\r\n	The events described herein are, in fact, really very likely, being founded, to a certain extent, on an all but true episode, which actually happened, after a fashion, in a modified degree.\r\n\r\nBlessed nowadays with a plenitude of leisure, I thought I’d take up a musical instrument.  \r\n\r\nI have long been able to slap around a piano and tootle a recorder and I can strum and pick the basic Peter-Paul-&-Mary chords on a guitar.  And though I cannot play the trumpet, I know how a trumpet is played.  \r\n\r\nI learned the fingerings of the trumpet when I was in junior high school but I could never get a good sound out of the instrument because of a crevice in my cranium.  At least that is my diagnosis of the problem.\r\n\r\nI have not consulted a physician about my suspected cranial crevice.  There has been no official diagnosis; no x-rays to prove its existence.  It has never proven problematical, except insofar as it impeded my ability to play the trumpet. I can only attest that, when I, an earnest seventh grader, blew hard into the trumpet mouthpiece, tiny streams of air shot from the inner corners of my eyeballs.  Seriously!  It was an unpleasant sensation and prevented me from hitting the higher notes.  \r\n\r\nI insist:  there’s a sneaky leak somewhere in the grottos, caverns and cavities of the labyrinth that separates my esophagus from my parietal bone.  I doubt if modern medicine, for all its advances, could caulk this leak, certainly not non-invasively.  \r\n\r\nThus, I never excelled at the trumpet.  I was relegated to the Third Trumpet section in the Lexington Jr. High School band.  Third trumpet parts rarely ascend beyond G-above-middle-C.\r\n\r\nThe tuba is a cousin of the trumpet, or more like a portly uncle.  It asks the same fingering and does not require the intense air pressure necessary to the sounding of the trumpet.  So I thought, “It’s never too late; I’ll take up the tuba.”  \r\n\r\nWe still have the old tuba we bought for our son when he was in the seventh grade.  He eventually soared far beyond the tuba, becoming a master trombonist, the veteran half a dozen tours of Europe and Brazil, dozens of US tours and a featured artist at thousands of gigs.  He isn’t playing much these days because weddings and corporate events are postponed and few bars are hiring bands.  Fortunately, he is also a trained and highly skilled Mechatronic Technician so he does not depend upon the trombone for income.\r\n\r\nLugging the old tuba up from the basement, I found it heavier than I had remembered.  The weight of the tuba is of no import once it is properly propped on the knees of a seated tuba-ist.  I positioned myself on the bench in our foyer and commenced the enterprise.\r\n\r\nNo man is an island.  My wife’s was a rapid response.  She did not offer what could be termed ‘active encouragement.’  She gave voice to her conviction that our life would be more serene if I did not attempt to master the tuba inside the house.  I must needs continue the attempt ‘à l’extérieur.’ \r\n\r\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, they say.  Her suggestion prompted an idea which I believe to be uniquely my own.  I find no mention of it on the internet.  \r\n\r\nI cobbled together a system of nylon ropes and pulleys, stretching the web betwixt the two large pines from which my beloved hammock is slung.  With a hearty “Heave, ho!”, I hoisted the tuba.  It’s out there now, aloft, gently a-sway in the morning breeze.  I could take you back into the pines and show you.  \r\n\r\nI don’t worry about rain.  Remember, it’s just an old tuba, tarnished, dented and cheap.  (I may take it down during the winter months, I haven’t decided yet.  It would be fun to play “Frosty, the Snowman” out there in January.)  \r\n\r\nThe project took a bit of doing, but I was excited about it; the rewards would be great. \r\n\r\nIt’s very simple, really.  Once recumbent in the hammock, I give the rope a gentle tug and down comes the tuba.  The trick is to do it slowly.  The first time I employed the device I didn’t realize the importance of lowering it slowly and it fell hard onto my stomach.  Oomph.  Or I should say, “Oom pah?”  \r\n\r\nReclining, with the bulk of the weight borne by the ropes,I embrace the tuba fervidly and press my lips to her sun-warmed mouthpiece.  \r\n\r\nI started out with the immortal ditties that all beginning instrumentalists master: “Twinkle,” “Hot Cross Buns” and “The Erie Canal.”  At first the melodies were not identifiable.  The initial sounds I made did not suggest music; the sounds were more along the lines of random tooting.  \r\n\r\nThe neighbors, enjoying a late afternoon beer on their patio, mistakenly assumed the tooting sounds to be coming from the outhouse, which is a little further back in the pine grove, though still near the hammock.  Hearing these noises, they feared I was unwell and, as they told me later, became quite alarmed.  When I paused between songs, they didn’t know whether to shout “Encore!” or call 911.  \r\n\r\nHowever, as my skills quickly improved, their alarm softened into appreciation.  They hadn’t realized that “Climb Every Mountain” could be emitted by such means from an outhouse, as they mistakenly assumed.  And so expressively!  Such feeling!\r\n\r\nHumbly, I shrugged off their praise.  It’s no big deal, I assured them.  It only asks a little breath control.\r\n\r\nAnd now for some music -- sweet, silly and less than 30 seconds long. \r\n\r\nLet’s hear Bill Perconti and his Alloy Saxophone Quartet playing his transcription of the fourth movement from my suite, “Our Home.”  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),155);

When I was growing up there in the 1950’s, Johnny''s name was in lots of places around town. \r\n\r\nThere was the: \r\nJohnny Appleseed Junior High School (where my cousins went),\r\nJohnny Appleseed Boy Scout Council (of which my troop was a part),\r\nJohnny Appleseed Shopping Center (in the parking lot of which I learned to ride a bicycle), 	\r\nJohnny Appleseed Realty (through which my parents bought our home),\r\nand the Johnny Appleseed Coffee Shop in the Leland Hotel (where my Grandma sometimes took me to lunch).  \r\n\r\nThere was even a small, stone monument to Johnny Appleseed in South Park, next to the historic Blockhouse, a two-story log structure built in the pioneer days to defend Mansfield.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of 1812, Johnny Appleseed saved Mansfield from an Indian attack by running, alone, thirty miles south to Mount Vernon.  He convinced the soldiers stationed there to hurry back with him to Mansfield.  They marched quickly and arrived in the nick of time.  When the Indians saw the soldiers arriving, they called off their attack.  \r\n\r\nWe all knew this story.  For Mansfielders, it was the most important thing about Johnny Appleseed.  Of course we also knew that Johnny Appleseed planted apple trees so that the pioneers, newly arrived in the Ohio wilderness, would find fruit hanging from the bough.  \r\n\r\nApples were the only fruit available on the frontier and the pioneers used apples in many ways.  They made apple butter, apple sauce, apple pies and cider.  The ran string through apples and hung them up to dry, eating them months later.  They wrapped apples in burlap and buried them in the dirt floors of their cabin homes, digging them up months later, finding them still crunchy and edible.  Most importantly, the pioneers made vinegar from Johnny’s apples and used it to pickle their vegetables, preserving them against the long, cold Ohio winters, when gardens lay fallow and buried in snow.\r\n\r\nWe knew the facts about him.  His real name was John Chapman and he lived from 1774 until 1845.  It said so, right there on his monument.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me that Johnny Appleseed could be dismissed as a fictional character.  When I left Ohio to go to college I met students from other parts of the country who thought our hero was “just made up.”  That was a shock.  Even those who knew he was an historical figure didn’t revere him the way we did back home.  \r\n\r\nHe may be known to more Americans than any of our other folk heroes; every first grader has at least heard of Johnny Appleseed.  How many first graders have heard of Wyatt Earp?\r\n\r\nCuriously, our best known folk hero is unknown to Europeans.  My cultivated, well-traveled, well-read French and English friends were ignorant of Johnny''s life and achievements until they heard me talk about him.\r\n\r\nEven in this country, there’s confusion about him.  Though he was a real person, Johnny also became a mythic figure, a folk hero.  The notion that he went barefoot and dressed in rags (true) and wore a tin pot on his head (false) have rendered him slightly ridiculous.  Unfair.  Pioneer diaries and letters mention that Johnny often wore some pretty unusual hats, but none specify a tin pot.\r\n\r\nStill, the tin pot is here to stay.  We will always think of Johnny as barefoot, raggedly clad, a tin pot on his head.  The image befits a saint; Johnny has an “attribute.”  We recognize St. Peter because he’s the one holding the keys;  we recognize Johnny by the tin pot on his head.\r\n\r\nJohnny IS a saintly figure.  A deeply religious man, he practiced and preached his cherished Swedenborgianism to anyone who would listen, passed out pamphlets to anyone who would accept them.  He seems to have thought of himself as an American John the Baptist, a spiritual non-conformist, a voice in the wilderness, literally.  \r\n\r\nWhat did the pioneers make of him?  By all accounts, they loved him, eccentricities and all.  Dr. Betty Reed, who met the medical needs of rural Richland County for over sixty years, told me that the story passed along in her family was that her ancestors warmly welcomed Johnny but asked him to sleep in the barn, “because, you know, he didn’t smell very good."\r\n\r\nToday Johnny is under-appreciated.  Perhaps we need to deepen the understanding of him we all formed when we were in the first grade. \r\n\r\nJohnny is just about our only non-violent American folk hero.  Think about it.  American folk heroes are men and women of violent action:  Davy Crockett kills bears, Indians and Mexicans until the latter finally kill him; Betty Zane dares to run through the crossfire to bring back much-needed ammunition; Molly Pitcher loads cannons; Jim Bowie throws his knife; the Earps shoot it out at the OK Corral; there’s Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Doc Holiday; the ruthless bison-buster Buffalo Bill;  Billy the Kid and Bonnie and Clyde who rob banks and kill at random;  George Armstrong Custer, who massacres with a free hand and an untrammeled conscience until he gets himself massacred at the Little Big Horn, going down in ill-gotten ‘glory.''  \r\n\r\nEven our fictional folk heroes are "rough-oh, tough-oh":  Paul Bunyan levels old growth forests; Pecos Bill lassoes and rides tornadoes, Johnny Henry bursts his heart competing with a mechanical spike-driver.  There’s Frankie and Johnny.  Tom Dooley.  Casey Jones.  All violent.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions?  I can think of two.  There’s Betsy Ross.  She sews the flag, quietly, patiently, precisely.  \r\n\r\nThen there''s our Johnny, the nurturer.  He plants and tends apple trees.  Our kinda guy, you and me.  It does us good to be reminded of him.\r\n\r\nI’ve given many talks about Johnny to historical societies and in schools.  He is the subject of Chapter One in my book, “Heroes of Ohio.”  I wrote and starred in a half-hour documentary film about him.  I impersonated Johnny for fourteen September “Apple Fests” at Heritage Village in Cincinnati’s Sharon Woods Park, something I still do in various other places.  That’s right.  I present myself at events barefoot, in raggedy clothes, wearing bright red suspenders and a tin pot on my head.  On those occasions, for a little while, I get to BE Johnny Appleseed!\r\n\r\nWe even named our son after him:  John Chapman Sowash.  He goes by “Chapman.”  We call Chap for short.\r\n\r\nLater on this morning, as I do every year on the Sunday closest to Johnny''s birthdate — September 26 —I will speak up during the part of our church service we call ''Prayers of the People,'' giving thanks for the life, contributions and example of Johnny Appleseed, America’s best-known non-violent folk hero and the unofficial patron saint of my home state, Ohio.\r\n\r\nI’ve written several pieces of music about J.A., including a duo for violin and cello entitled “A Suite of Virtues:  A Tribute to John Chapman.”  There are seven movements, each evoking an old-fashioned virtue:  Optimism, Enterprise, Perseverance, Certitude, Soulfulness, Joyfulness and Faith.\r\n\r\nAlas, it’s never been recorded so I can’t share any of it with you.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, how about THIS for an idea?  If you’re a violinist or a cellist, here’s an opportunity.  Just ask and I’ll send you free PDFs of the sheet music for this duo; you can print ‘em and play the piece.  If you find that you like it and would kindly record it, send me the mp3s and I’ll feature your performance in these weekly emails. \r\n\r\nI’ve also written a three-movement choral work about Johnny, entitled “Apple Songs,” another of my works which is still waiting to be recorded.  I made a baritone-piano version of "Apple Songs" and one of those, “The Planting of the Apple Tree,” HAS been recorded.  See above.\r\n\r\nThe text is by William Cullen Bryant:\r\n\r\nCome, let us plant the apple-tree.\r\nCleave the tough green sod with the spade;\r\nWide let its hollow bed be made;\r\nThere gently lay the roots with kindly care,\r\nAnd press it o’er them tenderly,\r\nAs, round the sleeping infant’s feet,\r\nWe softly fold the cradle sheet;\r\nSo we plant the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nWhat do we plant in this apple-tree?\r\nBuds, which the breath of summer days\r\nShall lengthen into leafy sprays;\r\nBoughs where the thrush, with crimson breast,\r\nShall haunt and sing and hide her nest.\r\nWe plant, upon the sunny lea,\r\nA shadow for the noontide hour,\r\nA shelter from the summer shower,\r\nWhen we plant the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Noel Bouley and collaborative pianist Phil Amalong perform my setting of "The Planting of the Apple Tree," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSeptember 25, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),119);

I am about to hold forth …\r\n\r\n	“Shortly after I had proposed marriage to the love of my life and she had accepted, I made my policy known.   There was one point of order upon which there could be no compromise.  In the strongest of terms, sir, I laid down the law, put my foot down and drew a line in the sand.  In short, I caused my bride to understand that, in this marriage, it would be she who would be making all the minor decisions, while the burden of making all the major decisions would fall squarely and solely upon my manly shoulders.\r\n\r\n	“Well, sir, nigh on to four-and-a-half decades have arrived and departed since that protocol was, as you might say, “carved in stone,” in a manner of speaking and so to speak.  And I may truthfully assert that we have abided by that covenant religiously.\r\n\r\n	"But here is the wonder of it.  During all that time, events have consistently unfolded in a such a way that there has never yet been a single major decision to be made.  No, sir.  Not one.  Every last decision that had to be made turned out to be, in fact, a minor decision.\r\n\r\n	“But you may be assured that when and if the need should arise for the making a major decision, it will be me, myself and I alone upon whom the burden of making said decision will fall.  You see?  Because, right from the start, I laid down the law, put my foot down, drew a line in the sand, made my policy known.  That is how things have stood and that is how they shall continue to stand ’til Death do us part.  On this point of order there can be no compromise.”\r\n\r\n(just joking … well, half-joking)\r\n\r\nMy wife, Jo, is little.  Four feet, ten inches.  A short lady with a short name.  “Jo" is not a nickname for Josephine or Joanne.  Her name is Jo.

She is a thoughtful, kindly, deeply caring and supportive mother and partner, the keystone of our little family and my closest friend for all these years.\r\n\r\nOne of the dearest folk-hymns of the Kentucky Shakers is entitled, “Love is Little.”  That hymn makes me think of Jo because she is little and loving and because she lullabyed our children with that hymn when they were very small.\r\n\r\nHere are the hymn''s sweet, simple words:\r\n\r\nLove is little.\r\nLove is low.\r\nLove will make my spirit grow.\r\n\r\nGrow in peace.\r\nGrow in light.\r\nLove will do the thing that’s right.  \r\n\r\nI wrote a set of variations on the hymn tune, entitling it a little whimsically:  “Six Lovely Little Variations on Love is Little.” \r\n\r\nI’ve written very nearly all of my music for particular musician friends, shaping my compositions to suit their tastes and personalities and keeping in mind the occasions when they might use the piece in performance.   This piece is the exception to that practice, insofar as I wrote it only for myself to play, upon my soprano recorder and as a little homage to my “Jo."\r\n\r\nIt works just fine when played on the clarinet, too.

I’m like the fellow Samuel Johnson described, who "tried all his life to be a philosopher but cheerfulness kept breaking in."\r\n\r\nI have written a few darker pieces.  A handful are sad and a few are mysterious.  These are not often heard because classical music radio stations rarely broadcast them and musicians shy away from performing such music for audiences.  It''s understandable.  \r\n\r\nExcept at funerals and commemorative events, we rarely welcome sad music.  I love Puccini’s saddest music; it makes me weep big, salty, cathartic tears.  But generally I avoid sad music.  If I turn on the radio and find myself in the middle of the last movement of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony, I switch to NPR.  Life is sufficiently difficult without having to endure that master’s final, despairing utterance yet again.\r\n\r\nMysterious music isn''t so offputting, though … when the full moon illuminates our familiar surroundings with a strange, silvery luster, mysterious music might be just what we want.  \r\n\r\nThe Nocturne from my Trio #6 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Goddess of the Moon," is my attempt to evoke the mystery, beauty and a little of the madness we associate with the moon, moonlight and Diana, the ancient Greek goddess of the moon.\r\n\r\nThink of this music as a love duet, sung by a mezzo and a baritone in a moonlit landscape, a scene from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, taking place simultaneously in ancient Greece and rural England.  \r\n\r\nThink of the clarinet as the mezzo and the cello as the baritone.  Think of the piano as the moonlit landscape, its white keys gleaming through the gloom of the black keys, like the full moon glimmering through a criss-cross of black branches. \r\n\r\nThat’s a pretty thought.  Strangely, what I most want to say about this music must remain unsaid for lack of a suitable word.  \r\n\r\nFor all its richness, this language we’ve borrowed from the English and adapted to meet the needs of the New World, occasionally abandons us, leaving us hobbled and halting.  At such moments we’re made to know that this glorious vehicle of expression, the language of Shakespeare, is ramshackle after all.  \r\n\r\nThe word that’s missing is an adjective that would refer directly to the moon, to its unique character.  The same holds true for the sun.  Consider that the sun crosses our sky every day and the moon, too, most nights.  Odd, no?, this paucity of pertinent verbiage?  \r\n\r\nI suppose every language has these curious gaps, these voids that leave writers grasping and speakers gasping.\r\n\r\nWe have perfectly good words for the heavenly bodies themselves:  the moon, the sun.  But scarcely any adjectives.  \r\n\r\nWe use “moony” to refer to someone who seems dreamy, unaware of their surroundings, disconnected from reality (usually because they are in love) but we never use the word to refer to the moon itself.  We never say, “That Nocturne is distinctly moony.”  Or “Last night seemed moonier than usual, didn’t you think?”  Or “Tonight marks the mooniest night of the month."\r\n\r\nDare we improvise? … venturing something like “moonish?” or “moon-ique?” "moonistic?” or “moon-esque?”  “moon-icious?”    Yikes!\r\n\r\nOur sole recourse is the Latinate word “lunar.”  It serves us well enough for scientific stuff. We speak of lunar landings or the lunar calendar of ancient Babylon.  But if I were to assert that, in this movement, I had attempted to write lunar music, you’d smile.  Moony music?  You’d chuckle.  Moonish music?  You’d sniff and roll your eyes.  Moonistic music?  Please.  \r\n\r\nIt’s the same with the sun.  True, we have the word ’sunny’ but, like ‘moony,'' it has a special, homespun meaning.  We speak of a sunny smile, a sunny disposition.  But who speaks of ''the planets in the sunny system?’  Again, for scientific things, we use ’solar.’  Jo and I will soon have solar panels (not ‘sunny’ panels) on our rooftop.  But a solar smile?  a solar disposition?  solar music?  We speak of solar rays, but never of solar days.\r\n\r\nCurious, isn’t it?  that an English-speaking composer is thus forestalled.  A fissure in our linguistic landscape, a crevasse too wide for leaping, precludes the expression of a simple, obvious aspect of this music — and it''s something that I really want to get said!\r\n\r\nI’ll try one more time:  I wanted to fashion a music that would be …. what ... ‘moon-image-derived?’   \r\n\r\nWhoa.  That’s hideous.  As my friend Chris Miller would say, “Jeezle Peets!"\r\n\r\nThen again, if it''s obvious to listeners that the music is “moon-image-derived,” then it doesn’t need to be stated in words.  The music will express the notion musically.  See what you think.\r\n\r\nTo hear my Nocturne played with dark, beautiful passion by clarinetist Joe Rosen and some friends of his (Joe recorded it in his living room some years ago and can no longer recall which of his many musical friends were playing the cello and the piano on that occasion), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 16, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThere''s a full moon this weekend.\r\n\r\nMost of my music is sunny, optimistic, bucolic.  I can''t help it.  I like to make people smile.  I''m the fellow who "tried all his life to be a philosopher but cheerfulness kept breaking in."\r\n\r\nI have written a few darker pieces.  A handful are sad or mysterious and one, just one, is really angry.   These are rarely heard because classical music radio stations shy away from broadcasting them and musicians shy away from performing them.   Do audiences really want to hear such stuff?  Who needs sad, angry music?  Isn''t life sufficiently difficult with that?\r\n\r\nI hesitate to share them, even with you.  Maybe sometime.\r\n\r\nMysterious music isn''t so offputting, though ... and the full moon is upon us.  I hope you have ten minutes to listen to three short nocturnes from my Trio #6 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Goddess of the Moon."\r\n\r\nThis music is my attempt to evoke the mystery, beauty and madness we associate with the moon, moonlight and Diana, who was, for the ancient Greeks, the goddess of the moon.\r\n\r\nThink of these three little nocturnes as love duets from "A Midsummer Night''s Dream."  What is the clarinet but a mezzo?  What is the cello but a baritone?  What is the piano but a moonlit landscape? Think of the piano''s white keys shining through the black keys, like the full moon glimmering through black branches criss-crossed like claws, a dreamy, moonlit scene where the clarinet and the cello meet, embrace and entwine.   \r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera playing Three Nocturnes from Trio #6 "Goddess of the Moon," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nAugust 9, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter discovering the scherzo from my “Goddess of the Moon” trio two days ago, several of you asked to hear the other movements of that five-movement work.\r\n\r\nThe movements are organized thusly:\r\n\r\nI.  Prologue (short)\r\nII.  Nocturne (long)\r\nIII.  Interlude (short)\r\nIV.  Scherzo (long)\r\nV.  Epilogue (short)\r\n\r\nThe first, third and final movements aspire to the gorgeousness of Debussy’s best-loved piano work, “Claire de Lune.”  The lengthy second movement evokes a powerful and frightening encounter with Diana, goddess of the moon.  The scherzo is a sinister joke.\r\n\r\nThe second and fourth movements can be performed as a single entity:  “Nocturne & Scherzo for Clarinet, Cello & Piano."\r\n\r\nThe first, third and fifth movements can be presented as “Three Nocturnes for Clarinet, Cello & Piano."\r\n\r\nOr the entire work can be presented as “Trio #6 for for Clarinet, Cello & Piano:  Goddess of the Moon."\r\n\r\nIn spirit, all five movements are nocturnal, mysterious.\r\n\r\nI have written a scant handful of mysterious pieces.  These are not often heard. Classical music radio stations rarely broadcast them and musicians shy away.   \r\n\r\nYet mysterious music can be delicious … when the moon illuminates familiar surroundings with a strange, silvery luster, mysterious music might be just what we want.  \r\n\r\nParts of this Nocturne can be heard as a duet, rich and strange, sung by a mezzo and a baritone in a moonlit landscape. \r\n\r\nThink of the clarinet as the mezzo and the cello as the baritone.  Think of the piano as the landscape, it''s white keys gleaming through the gloom of the black keys, like the full moon glimmering through black branches, criss-crossed. \r\n\r\nOther parts are suggestive of what it might feel like to be lost in the woods at night … and then, toward the end, to find one’s way again, to return, as we do at the end of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream."\r\n\r\nTo hear my Nocturne played with dark, beautiful passion by clarinetist Joe Rosen, cellist Adiel Shmit and pianist Taisiya Pushkar (recorded during one of Joe’s frequent and much-loved living room recitals), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThere''s a full moon this weekend and thus, an excuse for me to invite you to listen to three short nocturnes from my Trio #6 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Goddess of the Moon."\r\n\r\nThe entire work has five movements:\r\n	I.  Prologue (short)\r\n	II.  Nocturne (long)\r\n	III.  Interlude (short) \r\n	IV.  Scherzo (long)\r\n	V.  Epilogue (short)\r\n\r\nThis music is my attempt to evoke the mystery, beauty and madness associated with the moon, moonlight and Diana, who was, for the ancient Greeks, the goddess of the moon. \r\n\r\nThe Prologue, Interlude and Epilogue can be performed as an independent work titled, “Three Nocturnes.”  Similarly the second and fourth movements can be performed as a work titled, “Nocturne & Scherzo.”  \r\n\r\nThink of these three short nocturnes as love duets from "A Midsummer Night''s Dream."  What is the clarinet but a mezzo?  What is the cello but a baritone?  What is the piano but a moonlit landscape?  Think of the piano''s white keys shining on either side of the black keys, like the full moon glimmering through black branches, a mesh of criss-crossed claws, a dreamy, moonlit scene where the clarinet and the cello entwine.   \r\n\r\nListen prudently!  Moonlight can enchant.  Be particularly mindful of the final phrase of the Epilogue,  It confers a delicate closure on both the Three Nocturnes-version and the entire “Goddess of the Moon” trio.  Wistfulness opens hearts during that passage, as it does in Puck’s final speech.

I dismissed such assertions as mere propaganda, a ‘come hither’ pitch devised by a marketing team commissioned by Vermont’s Department of Tourism to attract leaf-peepers. \r\n\r\nI expressed my disdain, right out loud, for anyone to hear.  Fool that I was, I maintained that  "Orange is orange!  Red is red!  Purple is purple!  What appreciable difference can there be between the autumn foliage of Vermont and, say, Ohio?”\r\n\r\nThen came an October when we made the drive from Williamstown MA to Burlington VT.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I was wrong.”\r\n\r\nThat’s the line the agnostic journalist H.L. Mencken kept at the ready, rehearsing for his arrival in Heaven, should such a place exist and should such a moment arrive.  Mencken told his friends that when and if he should find himself in the august company of the Twelve Apostles, he would simply say:  “Gentlemen, I was wrong.”\r\n\r\nThe things artists know for certain about their own work can be wrong.  Mark Twain maintained that his best writing was to be found in his now forgotten historical novel Joan of Arc.  Maybe he was right; I’ve never read it; nor, so far as I know, has anyone else in my circle of acquaintances.  When I want to pass time in the company of Mark Twain, I re-read Huckleberry Finn.  \r\n\r\nWe artistic types can be mistaken, too, as to whether or not a particular work is finished and complete.  \r\n\r\nThe music I want to share today began as a choral setting of Prospero’s great speech from The Tempest, the one that opens with “Our revels now are ended” and closes with “we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I finished my setting of that magnificent text, I thought I was finished with the tune.  Apparently the tune wasn’t finished with me.  A few years later it grew into the second movement of my Piano Trio #4, beautifully and lovingly recorded by the Mirecourt Trio.  I had nailed it this time, for sure.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the Mirecourt Trio play it, I realized that I had been wrong, once again.  Oh, they played it perfectly!  But at the climax of the movement, I had written the cello part so extremely high that only a consummate virtuoso like Terry King could hope to render it.  \r\n\r\nI was present for the recording session and Terry did more than sixty ‘takes’ before he was satisfied.  Sixty!  It was agonizing because I knew that the blame lay upon my own poor judgment.  \r\n\r\nI offered to re-score the movement but Terry was determined to tackle it.  Finally, he did.   Beautifully, as you’ll hear shortly.  \r\n\r\nHowever, because of that grotesquely high passage, the trio has remained the least performed of my best chamber works.\r\n\r\nHere was this richly expressive, autumnal music, secreted away and mouldering, imprisoned and silenced in a piece that few musicians would ever dare attempt to play.\r\n\r\nYet the tune is lovely — it’s a singing tune, a melodic tune, a choral tune, after all!  \r\n\r\nSome years later, the music grew yet again, transforming itself into another choral work, this time a setting of these wise, autumnal, Prospero-like words by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross:\r\n\r\n“For someone who has not first loved, death always comes too soon.  But for those who embrace the energies of life, joy in creation, compassion and love, the fear of death has long since disappeared."\r\n\r\nAt last I knew that I had nailed it.  \r\n\r\nTime passed.\r\n\r\nThen my cellist friend Josh Aerie asked me to write a piece he could play with his flutist and pianist friends in their newly-formed Sylvan Trio.  Suddenly, I saw a chance to rectify the ‘problem’ of the cello being required to play the almost impossibly high notes in the piano trio movement:  re-score the music yet again and give those high notes to the FLUTE!  \r\n\r\nI devised a four-movement suite for the Sylvan Trio entitled Seasonal Breezes and the wandering tune has, at last, found its final resting place in the “Autumn Breeze” movement. They plan to record the suite; one of these days I’ll share it with you.\r\n\r\nI’ve nailed it at last!\r\n\r\n(Or am I wrong, once more?  Who knows?)\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) performing the second movement of my piano trio #4, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely have composers been scarred for life while playing ping pong.  \r\n\r\nAs a rule, tune-smiths eschew the rough-and-tumble world of sports. \r\n\r\nMozart was a celebrated billiard player and there are photos of young Charles Ives in his Yale baseball uniform.  But if Berlioz was big on badminton or Elgar showed prowess in the tennis court or if Brahms’ fans at Baden Baden leapt to their feet, cheering his audacity at volleyball, these composers'' biographers have been strangely silent on the subject.\r\n\r\nMe?  Although the harrow of Time has gouged my brow, a close inspection still reveals a dashing half-inch scar just above my left eyebrow.  I make no attempt to conceal it; nay, I wear it as a badge of honor, the mark of a duel, ardently fought, long ago, not with cutlasses, sabers or scimitars but rather -- with ping pong paddles!\r\n\r\nThough ludicrously inadept, I adore ping-pong, a game I have played for hours on end and never more passionately than when I was in my late teens, locked in mortal combat with my brother Jonathan, four years my junior.\r\n\r\nOur boyhood home had no space for a ping pong table but we squeezed one into the basement, nevertheless.  It was closely crowded on all sides with shelving, luggage, camping equipment, a mud sink, an incinerator (remember those?), a washer and a dryer.    \r\n\r\nMy brother Jonathan and I were, like most brothers, fiercely competitive.  If a hamburger was to be shared between us, we would toss a coin to see which of us got to slice the burger as precisely down the middle as possible and then, the surgical incision accomplished, the non-slicer was allowed his choice of whichever half he deemed, upon close inspection, to be ever-so-slightly larger.\r\n\r\nWhen we ping-ponged, it was a death match.  Self esteem hung in the balance.   \r\n\r\nOne evening, our parents having gone off somewhere in the family''s blue Ford station wagon, leaving the three Sowash brothers at home, we watched “Gunsmoke” and then the older two of us took paddles in hand.  I was 19 and Jonathan was 15, having just come to man’s estate by dint of having enrolled in the Drivers’ Education class.  He was, thus, more determined than ever to prove himself on the green table of honor.  Our youngest brother, Bradley, 9 years old, served as our audience, wide-eyed and admiring.\r\n\r\nVictory in ping pong goes to whichever player first gains twenty-one points but only if he is two points ahead of his opponent.  If the score is 21-20, the game continues until one player pulls two points out in front of the other.  This can induce almost unbearable excitement.\r\n\r\nWe were neck in neck and the score had stretched into the high twenties.  Try as we might, neither of us could pull ahead by the requisite two points.  We were tied.  Then, Jonathan’s returning ball overshot my end of the table, putting me one point ahead.  \r\n\r\nOne more point and the game would be clinched!  Victory was within my grasp!  \r\n\r\nBut the ball, in flying clear of the table, had fallen into the narrow space between the washer and the dryer.  I was so excited that I lunged over to the laundry section of the basement, spotted the ball on the floor at the bottom of that narrow gap and, with nary a thought of personal protection, I dove for it.\r\n\r\nWith all my might and with all the speed I could muster, I stretched my right arm toward the ball, distending the limb in the fashion of a contortionist and, in reaching for the ball, in my extreme eagerness, using all the force of my upper body, I banged my forehead, specifically the region above my left eyebrow, onto the sharp corner of the dryer, bouncing my head and shoulders back to a standing position like a basketball rebounding from a wooden gym floor.\r\n\r\nBright, white stars spun before my eyes, atop a crimson curtain.  The amount of blood that gushes from a head wound gives one pause.\r\n\r\nThe force of this curious, self-inflicted blow nearly knocked me out but Jonathan steadied me before I keeled over.  Bradley and he half-pulled, half-pushed me up the stairs, while I clasped the railing with one hand, my frontal bone with the other.\r\n\r\nWe were scared, there was so much blood.  We couldn''t reach our parents.  No cell phones in those days, no 9-1-1.  Like our dad, I was an Eagle Scout, Jonathan would be, soon, and Bradley ‘made Eagle,’ a few years later.  We knew to apply direct pressure.  It slowed but didn’t stop the bleeding.  \r\n\r\nAfter soaking a towel with scarlet mud, we decided to go to the hospital.  I was far too dizzy and sick to drive.  Jonathan would be our chauffeur, though his knowledge of the craft was admittedly limited.  We got ourselves into the Morris Minor, the Three Brothers Sowash-mazov.  With no clear notion of how to get from our house to the Mansfield General Hospital, we set out.  \r\n\r\n“It’s weird,” piped up little Bradley from the back seat.  “We were all three born at the same hospital but none of us know how to get there."\r\n\r\nJonathan’s Drivers’ Ed. Class had not yet covered ‘stick shift.’   I tried to explain the clutch.  We coasted through the green stop lights but jerked, stalled and restarted at every red stop light and stop sign.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story interminable, somehow we got to the hospital.  When the E.R. doctor asked us what had happened, I had to suffer the embarrassment, not for the last time, of explaining that this dramatic injury was the result of a boisterous game of ....  ahem, uh, er ... ping-pong!  \r\n\r\nThe human face can register many expressions.  One of them is “Boing!” \r\n\r\nWell, they stitched me up proper.  To this day, I still carry just the tiniest scar,  proving that the story is true.  It''s somewhat obscured amongst the furrows that crease my brow, now that I am well stricken in years.  But in the right light it can still be shown off.  Ask me, next time we run into each other and I’ll show it to you.  Men love to show off their scars.\r\n\r\nNowadays, of a winter''s night, after a substantial and well-digested meal, when the menfolk take their places round the glowing hearth, tug off their shoes with their toes, and lean and loaf at their ease, patting their bulging vests and telling  anew the stories of the epic adventures through which they''ve passed, the narrow brushes with Death, the hair''s breadth escapes, the feats of derring-do  and the miraculousness of their having lived to tell the tale, I wait until the young’uns have had their say and then I bring out my ping-pong story.  The stirring saga is told again, with fresh exaggerations each time.  It never fails to achieve its full effect.\r\n\r\nAlmost the only really athletic music I’ve written is the first movement of my Piano Trio #4, recorded with great gusto by the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Kenneth Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen).

The slope rises westward, ending abruptly at what are called “the cliffs above the Clear Fork.”  Rural graveyards are often on hilltops; Bellville’s founders reserved the adjacent acres for the village cemetery.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve happy years when we lived in Bellville, the cemetery was my favorite place to go for a walk.  Back then, from atop the cliffs there was a splendid view to the west of rich farm land, distant forests and the serpentine windings of the Clear Fork.  \r\n\r\nNow and forever more the scene is marred by a huge gravel pit.

There is no zoning in Jefferson Township.  There are a lot of gravel pits.\r\n\r\nThe view from the cliffs was best seen on a bleak November day.

A touch of weather -- a smear of fog, a scarf of mist, a dash of drizzle — enhanced and intensified the sombre mood of the moment and the place.\r\n\r\nI liked to imagine that I shared the view with the spirits of the early settlers buried nearby, a host of ghostly pioneers, peering westward from their final resting places, perhaps still itching to know what’s further out there, further "out West."  \r\n\r\nThe place prompted such thoughts ... reflections on the pioneers, the natives that were here before them, the Moundbuilders further back, the mastodon-hunters further yet, and, before any of us, the glaciers (which deposited the gravel) and, before the whole shebang, the changeless starry sky.\r\n							\r\nI tried to catch some of the above in the piece for cello and piano I want to share with you today.\r\n\r\nI dedicated The Cliffs Above the Clear Fork to cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen.

Our son, Chap, will be 106.  The recent election will be almost exactly as far in the past as the attack on Pearl Harbor is now in the past behind us.\r\n\r\nHere in Cincinnati the sky was clear all night long.  When times are troublous sleep is intermittent;  during the wee hours that night, I went outside to look at the moon.  Call me moonstruck; it was astonishingly bright and beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt brought to mind "The Lake of the Mind,” a prose-poem by Paramahansa Yogananda.\r\n\r\n	In ruffled water the moon’s reflection cannot be clearly seen.\r\n	Only when the surface is perfectly calm does the moon’s reflection appear.\r\n		So it is with the mind.\r\n	When calm, you see clearly reflected the mooned face of the soul.\r\n	And our souls are reflections of God.\r\n	Withdraw all restlessness from the lake of the mind and behold your soul, \r\n		a perfect reflection of God.\r\n\r\nBack in 2010, when hopes were higher, I set these quiet, lovely words to music, fashioning them into a motet for two-part women’s chorus.  The pure, clean sound of women’s voices seemed more apt than the more usual mix of male and female voices in a four-part mixed chorus.\.  \r\n\r\nI tried to make the music paint the words, evoking the “ruffled water” with a gently rippling melodic line, casting the rising sopranos as the moon and the descending altos as the moon''s reflection.\r\n\r\nThe ‘mooned’ mystery of the opening music evolves and resolves into clarity as the poet expands his metaphor with the assuaging assurance that "our souls are reflections of God.”\r\n\r\nMay we all be assuaged and assured.

Nor a mom in a booth at an elementary school fund-raiser.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the world’s most respected oracle; the oracle most frequently consulted by the greatest number of believers over thousands of years.  It was the I Ching, usually translated as The Book of Changes.\r\n\r\nThe I Ching is an ancient Chinese divination text that has generated more than two and a half millennia''s worth of commentary and interpretation.  It is at the heart of Asian culture.\r\n\r\nWhen I served a four-year term as a County Commissioner in Richland County, Ohio, one of the responsibilities I took on was to oversee our sister county relationship with Taipei County in Taiwan.  I led three cultural exchange groups to Taiwan and hosted visiting dignitaries and artists when they visited us in turn.\r\n\r\nPrior to my first visit to Taiwan, my hosts thoughtfully wrote to inquire about my interests; they were eager to devise an intinerary that would be meaningful for me.  I told them I was interested in Chinese culture:  I wanted to learn about Chinese art, music, literature, cuisine, parks and the I Ching, about which I had read.  They loved me for that.  They discovered, to their great delight, that my interest in their cuture was foretold by, of all things, my last name -- Sowash -- which they pronounced “Tsu Hua Chi.”  In Chinese, they informed me, this means:  “curious about China.”  Who could have seen THAT coming?\r\n\r\nAccordingly, during my first eleven-day visit, my hosts escorted me to museums, recitals, parks and the studios of painters and ceramic artists.  And they took me to the Taiwanese center for I Ching studies, a library curated and directed by a team of scholars.\r\n\r\nThe building’s exterior was unimpressive, an undistinguished, soiled hulk on a crowded, badly littered street. \r\n\r\nInside was another world.  A hushed sanctuary, dim and musty, redolent of thumbworn books.  \r\n\r\nFive scholars greeted me and my interpreter.  They were wizened little men, very old, hunched, bespectacled, their faces as wrinkled as dried apples.  They wore narrow black neckties, dirty white shirts and crumpled black suits, threadbare, with shiny elbows.  The cuffs of their sleeves and pants were badly frayed, their shoes scuffed, the heels worn down.  They wore scraggly, white goatees; their mustaches were as wispy as their eyebrows.\r\n\r\nMy interpreter introduced me.  They bowed politely but seemed uninterested and unimpressed.  She explained that I wanted to know more about the I Ching.  One of them gave what appeared to be a rote speech, recounting how, in response to a query, coins are tossed to generate a sequence of apparently random numbers and that each sequence has a vast library of metaphors to assist our understanding of the meanings of the ‘window of time’ during which the coins were tossed.  The coins fall the way they do because they have been tossed during a particular window of time and each window offers its own wisdom, metaphors and meanings.\r\n\r\nI asked a few obvious questions.  What if the same question is asked twice in a row?  Is the meaning altered if the coins fall differently the second time?  Their responses were patient but perfunctory and I guessed they were eager to be done with me and to return to their studies.\r\n\r\nI was about to ask my interpreter if she thought our visit had gone on long enough when one of the scholars suddenly looked me in the eye and challenged me to ask a question of the I Ching.  I was not prepared for this.\r\n\r\n“But what shall I ask?”\r\n\r\n“Ask anything you like.  Anything at all.  It doesn’t matter.”\r\n\r\nI thought about asking how my wife and children were doing, 13,000 miles away, back in Ohio.  Then I thought more deeply about the opportunity.  What if I were to consult an oracle that warranted my respect?  What would I ask?\r\n\r\nIt came to me immediately:  Should I continue in politics?  Should I make politics my career?  I had been elected by a wide margin and it seemed that, in a few years, I could get myself elected to the state legislature and after that, who knows?  Yet, I thought of myself as a composer and a writer, not a career politician.  On the other hand, I had a family to support.  What should I do?\r\n\r\nThinking about this, I “stared in a hole” for a time.  When I raised my eyes, I found that all five scholars were staring at me with intense interest.  I had become ‘real’ to them.\r\n\r\nI told my interpreter, “I want to know whether or not I should continue my career in politics.”\r\n\r\nShe translated.  When they grasped what I was asking they nodded ever so slightly.  They tossed three coins onto the floor a number of times, the five of them bending over, peering through their little round spectacles to note the combinations of heads and tails that resulted from each toss.\r\n\r\nWhen the tossing was completed, they had their answer; they had determined during which ‘window of time’ the coins had fallen.  After twenty minutes of lively discussion amongst themselves one of them wrote two short phrases on a piece of paper and handed it to my interpreter.  They said that these phrases distilled the essence of the vast library pertaining to my particular question and the particular ‘window’ the coin tosses had indicated. \r\n\r\nShe translated:  \r\n\r\n“Stay in the field and you will catch the animal.”\r\n\r\n			… and …\r\n\r\n“A move to the south will prove beneficial.”\r\n\r\nIt was not the clear and conclusive guidance I had expected, but I thanked them, we all bowed, and my interpreter and I took our leave.\r\n\r\nThe remaining days of my stay in Taiwan were so jammed with activities that I only began to ponder these utterances during the long flight home.\r\n\r\nHaving no plans to move south, I dismissed the second phrase.  A year later we did move thirty miles south, to Gambier, Ohio, and six years after that we moved another 150 miles south to Cincinnati.  Both moves proved enormously beneficial in many ways.\r\n\r\nWhat was this about catching an animal?  I wasn’t a trapper or a hunter in pursuit of game.  The utterance mentioned a field.  Was it the ‘field’ i.e., the ‘profession’ of politics?   You don’t catch animals in politics.  Could re-election or being elected to a higher office be understood as the political equivalent of catching an animal?  The image could readily apply to a trapper or a hunter, yes, but could it apply, as a metaphor, to me?  A composer / writer who had strayed into politics?  \r\n\r\nWhich begged the question, why are you in politics?  Why, indeed?  It had seemed like a good idea at the time and I had enjoyed campaigning, shaking hands, marching in the Labor Day parade wearing a “Sowash for Commissioner” t-shirt, giving short speeches at candidate’s nights.  \r\n\r\nI even kissed a baby!  A woman in the crowd at the edge of the street where I was passing in the Labor Day parade held up her infant child and shouted, “Aren’t you gonna kiss my baby?”  What was I supposed to do?  I kissed the baby.    \r\n\r\nBut the actual work of running the county was tedious.  Other than the routine chores of the job I achieved little more than hiring a competent and humane dog warden, instituting a bike trail and causing a sewer to be installed over the furious objections of the citizens whose waste the new system would process.  And I led the exchanges with Taiwan.\r\n\r\nSitting in the airplane, I imagined myself catching an animal.  A snarling, slavering creature, with shiny teeth and a rank smell, a cross between a skunk, a badger and a wolverine.  Shooting it would be bad enough.  But catching it?  With my bare hands?  Imagining what they would be like filled me with horror, but I forced myself to really think about it:  grasping a living creature by the scruff of its neck, lifting it off the ground, maybe trying to jam it into a cage as it squirmed and screamed and twisted, trying to claw me, to bite me.  That was what catching an animal would be like.  Was that something I wanted to do?  Definitely not.\r\n\r\nThe oracle’s utterance was a warning:  remain in politics and, yes, you will succeed;  you will have the proverbial tiger by the tail.  To be successful in politics is to have ‘caught the animal.’  Is that what you want to do with your energy, your creativity, your life?\r\n\r\nIt was not.  When my term was up, I left the field.  I did not run for re-election nor have I sought any office since.  I poured my energy instead into writing music and books and promoting my creations, bringing my gifts to the world.  That is what I have done, quite happily, ever since.\r\n\r\nStaying with metaphors from Nature, I opted, rather than trying to catch the animal, to catch the moon’s reflection on the water, a much pleasanter undertaking.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my setting of "The Lake of the Mind,” a prose-poem by Paramahansa Yogananda.\r\n\r\n	In ruffled water the moon’s reflection cannot be clearly seen.\r\n	Only when the surface is perfectly calm does the moon’s reflection appear.\r\n	So it is with the mind.\r\n	When calm, you see clearly reflected the mooned face of the soul.\r\n	And our souls are reflections of God.\r\n	Withdraw all restlessness from the lake of the mind and behold your soul, a perfect reflection of God.\r\n\r\nBack in 2010, I rendered these quiet, lovely words as a motet for two-part women’s chorus.  The pure, clean sound of women’s voices seemed more apt than the more usual mix of male and female voices in a four-part mixed chorus.  \r\n\r\nI tried make the music paint the words, evoking the “ruffled water” with a gently rippling melodic line, casting the rising sopranos as the moon and the descending altos as the moon''s reflection.\r\n\r\nThe ‘moon-ish’ mystery of the opening music evolves and then resolves into clarity as the poet expands his metaphor with the assuaging assurance that "our souls are reflections of God.”\r\n\r\nMay we all be thus assuaged and assured.  It sure beats catching an animal.\r\n\r\nTo hear my setting of "The Lake of the Mind" sung by the women of the Harvard University Choir, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),19);

Steve Van Kuiken, used to tell us.\r\n\r\nI had that in mind in 1998, when I wrote my first trio for clarinet, cello and piano, a work that aspires to describe, musically, a spiritual journey.  \r\n\r\nA journey must have a beginning point.  The first movement is lovely, sad and mysterious, trying to reconcile resigned yearning with an intense awareness of the beauty of the world, of life.  It''s ''a tall order,’ as we Midwesterners say, but that was what I was trying to achieve.  I figure, “Might as well aim for the stars!”\r\n\r\nThe second movement evokes the attempt most of us make to find meaning in Life through romantic love and, later, through nostalgia.  A crisis is reached in the third movement, when the instruments intone an “Alleluia” which was an important part of the Lutheran liturgy in the church of my boyhood.  \r\n\r\nThe fourth movement starts out to be an exuberant, joyful finale.  Doubt and mystery are soon felt again; the mysterious music of the first movement recurs; indeed, the music almost stops altogether.  Only the slow, strange ruminations of the cello keep it alive.  Then Beauty, if not Certitude, is reaffirmed and the piece ends -- not with a strong, positive gesture, but with a slowing, fading, rising gesture, ambiguously suggesting both resolution and non-resolution.  It seems to say, “The music ceases, but the voyage continues."\r\n\r\nToday, I want to share only the beautiful, strange first movement.  It is beautiful, partly because it uses harmonic progressions we remember from Bach.  His music compelled us to love them.  It is strange, partly because it is cast in 7/4, a meter which Bach, the most prolific of composers, never employed.  Also, each phrase of the tune, as you’ll hear immediately, has an odd, symmetrical structure:  four notes played first as quarter notes, then eighth notes, then sixteenth notes — and then in reverse — the next four notes are played as sixteenth notes, then eighth notes, then quarter notes.  \r\n\r\nSee what you make of it.\r\n\r\nThough I did not know it at the time, this trio, turned out to be the beginning of a much larger spiritual journey; it was the first of fifteen works I wrote for this combination of instruments, far more than I’ve written for any other combination of instruments.  I was obsessed with the possibilities inherent in combining a clarinet, a cello and a piano.  And the fifteen trios, considered as a whole, set a trajectory that culminated in my clarinet concerto, probably the best of all my works.\r\n\r\nThe Trio #1 was just the beginning.  It was my response to a request from my friend the French clarinetist Lucien Aubert and his ensemble, “les Gavottes.”  Lucien and his family live on the island of Corsica;  he kindly hosted us in his home for a five-night stay  two years ago.  What a sweet little family he has.  What a sweet home, what a sweet island.  A place of magic:  Lucien’s two little girls loved spotting how I did my corny disappearing-coin tricks.  Sometime I want to share with you another work of mine, subtitled “Memories of Corsica."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to hear the first movement of my Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano "Voyage of the Spirit” performed by the French ensemble “les Gavottes” and recorded by them on the CD “Enchantement d’avril," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJan. 31, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA few years ago I opened our mailbox to find a card from a lady with whom I was only slightly acquainted.  She wrote to tell me that a few years earlier she had attended a concert of my music where she had bought several of my CDs.  "To be honest," she wrote, "I had never opened them."  \r\n\r\nThen, a few weeks prior, her nine-year-old nephew died.  She drove nine hours, alone, to attend the funeral.  Just before leaving, she grabbed an armful of CDs and, by chance, mine were among them.  \r\n\r\nShe had written to tell me that, as she drove, she listened to my CDs, over and over and over, all the way there and back again after the funeral.  The music, she said, engaged her, made her smile sometimes and sometimes weep.  The music eased her pain, she said, eased her sad journey.  She said the music consoled her.\r\n\r\nThis was the greatest compliment I will ever receive.  It''s all the more meaningful because, when I wrote the music recorded on those CDs I did not dream that my tunes might solace someone in grief.  Much of my music is happy and snappy, sometimes wistful, sometimes almost trite.  Who would imagine such creations could comfort anyone?\r\n\r\nSome critics hate my music, some love it.  That''s to be expected.  But of what value is the opinion of any critic when compared to the content of that card?  A rave in the New York Times, a standing ovation at Carnegie Hall, a Pulitzer Prize ... these would not mean as much.\r\n\r\nI have breakfast every now and then with one of my oldest friends;  we''ve been pals since the 5th grade.  He has a nephew who is a composer.  I''ve never met this nephew and I''ve never heard any of his music but my friend tells me that his nephew has come through one of our most prestigious conservatories of music, where he learned to write music that would "attract critical attention."  He''s in a PhD program now, doubtless destined to land a tenured slot as a Composition Professor in some lofty Conservatory or School of Music where he will compose yet more avant garde music that few people really want to hear and direct his students to do the same.\r\n\r\nSigh.\r\n\r\nI told my friend about the card sent by the lady whose nephew died.  I told my friend that by writing avant garde music his nephew may win critical acclaim and a tenured faculty position but that such music will never elicit a compliment like the one I received from the grieving aunt.  My friend said I was probably right, but what can he do?  He can''t very well tell his nephew how to write music, how to shape his career.\r\n\r\nMe, I''m one of those fools who rushes in where angels fear to tread ... if I ever meet this nephew, I''ll tell him about the card the lady sent me.  I''ll try to gently caution him.  I''ll ask him to consider an alternative to the easy, obvious path to critical, academic and material success.  I''ll try to nudge him to leave that path and write, instead, music that -- who knows? -- might comfort a grief-stricken soul someday.\r\n\r\nI''ll tell him that, even this late in the History of Western Civilization, even after all we''ve been through in the last hundred years, even in these modern times ... memorable melodies with attractive tonal harmonies, interesting counterpoints and architectural integrity can still touch people, stir spirits, bring quiescent joy to a troubled heart. \r\n\r\nI don''t know which of my CDs or which selections of my music the lady heard during her long, sad, solo drive.  I hope she might have come on the second movement of my Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Voyage of the Spirit."  \r\n\r\nTo hear it tenderly rendered by "les Gavottes," the trio comprised of my French friends clarinetist Lucien Aubert, cellist Francois Adloff and pianist Jean Tatu, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSept. 14, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nPlease accept a gift:  a palate cleanser for the mind.   \r\n\r\nIt’s a gift I received from one of y''all, i.e., one of you good folks who kindly permit me to catapult these weekly emails into your in-box.  Today I want to pass along the gift to you.\r\n\r\nIt’s a five-minute film made by the late Gary Wakenhut and his wife Anne.  The two were partners in this creation, did the video work together and collaborated in bringing the film to its final form.   I never met Gary face-to-face but we enjoyed a warm exchange of emails for several years and Anne and I keep in touch via email.  \r\n\r\nGary was a healer, musician and videographer.  He was also an ardent protector and appreciator of the beautiful Pigeon River that flows through the north central part of the southern peninsula of Michigan, where he lived.  \r\n\r\nUtilizing, as the film score, the second movement of my Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano “Voyage of the Spirit”, Gary created a lovely piece of video art, shot at just this time of year, Indian summer.  He titled his film, “Life of the Forest:  The Pigeon River.”  \r\n\r\nGary really listened to the music.  You can tell by the way he ‘cross-fades’ his glorious images of the river at the precise moment when one phrase of music ends and another begins.  And the way he matches a rising feeling in the music with a segment when the camera''s view of the river is ascending.\r\n\r\nWith my blessing and gratitude, he mounted his film on YouTube for anyone to see and hear.  It’s just gorgeous.  See for yourself by copying and pasting this link into your browser:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICbdPOsIN8\r\n\r\nGary planned to make more films coupling my music with his beautiful video imagery but cancer came calling and took him away before he could do so.\r\n\r\nI’d love for more of my music to serve as film scores for video art with the quality of Gary’s work, either live action video or a series of still photographs, cross-faded.  \r\n\r\nIf you or anyone you know would like to make films or slide shows using my music as the soundtrack, I’d happily give permission, expecting no payment.  \r\n\r\nAs an ASCAP-affiliated publisher of my own music and producer of my own CDs, I own the rights to my work.  I’m at liberty to give it away.  That is what I’m doing these days, to the greatest extent possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are greater national treasures than the Shenandoah National Park.  We’ve visited many of them:  Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Acadia, Grand Tetons, Yellowstone, Yosemite.  \r\n\r\nNone has as strong a claim on my affections as "the Shenandoah.”  We even named our daughter after the park (and the beautiful folk song).\r\n\r\nI undertook my first backpacking trip there when I was 22, the beginning of a ‘Voyage of the Spirit’ that continues to this day.  I’ve been back many times, eating ‘Roosevelt Chicken'' at Big Meadows Lodge, hiking down from the ridge to view waterfalls and up from the ridge to overlooks, ascending ''Mary’s Rock’ a dozen times or more in the company of family and friends, some now long gone.\r\n\r\nThe Skyline Drive (the narrow, 35 mph parkway traversing the hundred-mile length of the park) has provided me with the most useful metaphor I’ve found to explain what a composer does.\r\n\r\nAlmost a hundred years ago, someone looked at that hundred-mile long wrinkle of rock and had an idea:  “Let’s build a road across the rim of the ridge!”  That’s the composer, perceiving a possibility and drawing a map, i.e., notating a score, to rough out how the possibility can be brought to reality.\r\n\r\nWorkers arrive.  They clear the brush, lay the asphalt, build the bridges, all as indicated on the designer’s map.  These are the musicians, bringing the composer’s vision to reality.\r\n\r\nFinally come the tourists, families on a Sunday drive.  Leaf-peepers, bless ‘em!  These are the listeners, be they on-line, in church, in a concert hall or taking in a radio broadcast.\r\n\r\nFor music to happen, those three roles must be cast:  composer, musician, listener.  Exactly thus, the Skyline Drive has been envisioned, built and enjoyed.\r\n\r\nA physical reality, yes;  also a metaphor for the Voyage of the Spirit.\r\n\r\n						* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAmong nations, the definition and function of what we Americans call “a park" varies dramatically.\r\n\r\nFrench national parks are punctuated with villages, cross-laced with roads and almost devoid of wildlife.   There are no raccoons or wildcats, let alone elk, caribou and mountain lions.  No grizzlies, no black bears.  All have long since been hunted to extinction.  About 80 wolves have eked out a living in southeastern France since the 1990’s. \r\n\r\nFrench city parks are very pretty to look at but most are not for “use" in the American sense.  Sun-bathing on the grass?  Spreading a vinyl tablecloth and picknicking?  No.  Not on the municipal “pelouse.”  In Aix-en-Provençe, our little family had to picnic on the hot, hard, crowded sidewalk, right next to the lush, cool lawn of the public park.  “Defense de marcher sur la pelouse."\r\n\r\n						* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nTaiwan’s Yang Ming Shan National Park presents an altogether different notion of a park.  You must have seen Chinese landscape paintings: a  rugged mountain-side, festooned in fog, arabesqued with twisting conifers, a tiny bridge arching a stream to a pagoda in which a scholar sits, sipping tea, writing a manuscript.  At the edge of the scene there will be a vertical poem in delicate, black Chinese characters and, in scarlet ink, an impression of the artist’s ’name chop.''\r\n\r\nThe idea of Yang Ming Shan National Park is to provide the visitor with the opportunity to ENTER such a painting.  There are little arching bridges and pagodas in which you can sit and imagine yourself to be the scholar in a painting.  Even the red ’name chop’ is there:  gigantic scarlet Chinese characters ‘defacing’ (to our way of thinking) giant flat-sided boulders.  We see this as graffiti; the Taiwanese see it as another indication that they are actually INSIDE a painting.  As for the fog, my interpreter told me that the Chinese love best the wet and misty days and that rainy days draw the biggest crowds to the park.  For the Chinese, mist is a powerful metaphor with a vast library of associations; when the weather turns foggy, they want to feel close to Nature.  Parks provide the opportunity.\r\n\r\n						* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nContrariwise, for Americans, a national park is intended to afford visitors the illusion of entering Eden, i.e., a region where Nature pristine, virginal, untouched by humankind.  Ironically, the illusion depends entirely upon the exact reverse of the notion:  roads must lead to and traverse the park, for the park to exist there must needs be food stands, gas stations, cabins, campgrounds, Visitor Centers, interpretive signs, ‘Do not to feed the wildlife’ signs, rangers, custodians, etc.)  \r\n\r\nUnderstand:  our continent has never been ‘untouched by human hands.’ From the day of our arrival we have been manipulating the landscape to suit our needs.  Our parks are a beautiful artifice, a precious illusion, every bit as contrived as the picture-perfect, untouchable French municipal parks or the Taiwanese notion of a park as a realization of a Chinese painting.\r\n\r\nWhat’s this?  The Shenandoah National Park an artifice?  But the Skyline Drive is so beautiful, so natural.  Yes, it is, in its way.  Yet, I was surprised to learn that, back in the 1930’s, when the park was new, the CCC planted over 100,000 trees along the Skyline Drive.  Today those trees are huge and look as if they sprang up ’naturally.’  \r\n\r\nIn fact, approximately four-score and seven years ago, they were placed by boys supervised by foresters and armed with shovels.  Left to their own devices most of those tree species would never have found their way to the Skyline Drive.  \r\n\r\nA park is a contrivance, an artifice -- be it in America, France or Taiwan.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s OK!  We dearly love our parks and rightly so.  The love we have for our national parks is patriotism at its healthiest, wholesomest, most authentic.  Ken Burns correctly termed our national parks “America’s best idea.”  \r\n\r\nThey best express what is best in our national ‘Voyage of the Spirit.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement from my Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled  "Voyage of the Spirit,” played by the French ensemble les Gavottes, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy Bastille Day.  As my way of affectionately saluting “la belle France,” I’d like to share the last movement of the first of thirteen trios I wrote for the French clarinet-cello-piano trio, les Gavottes.\r\n\r\nThe four movements of Trio #1 describe a spiritual journey.  \r\n\r\nThe first movement is lovely but also sad and mysterious, an expression of resigned yearning in tandem with an  awareness of the beauty of the world, of life. \r\n\r\nThe second movement evokes our attempt to find meaning in Life through romantic love and nostalgia for an idealized past. \r\n\r\nA crisis is reached in the third movement, resolved only when the instruments intone an “Alleluia” which was an important part of the Lutheran liturgy in the church of my boyhood.\r\n\r\nThen comes the movement I want to share today.  It starts out to be an exuberant, joyful finale.  However, doubt and mystery are soon felt again; the mysterious music of the first movement recurs; indeed, the music almost stops altogether.  Only the very slow, strange ruminations of the cello keep it alive.  \r\n\r\nThen Beauty, if not Certitude, is reaffirmed and the movement ends -- not with a strong, positive gesture of arrival at journey’s end, but with a slowing, fading, rising gesture, ambiguously suggesting both resolution and dissolution. \r\n\r\nThe music ceases, but the voyage of the spirit continues for all of us.\r\n\r\nTo the final movement of my Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano "Voyage of the Spirit” performed by the French ensemble “les Gavottes” (clarinetist Lucien Aubert, cellist François Adloff and pianist Jean Tatu), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are realms above and beyond the marshy shoreline of this rising swamp of terrible news.  \r\n\r\nFor example … here’s a vignette that’s blessedly unrelated to the troubles confronting us.\r\n\r\nDid I ever tell you that my name is on the Eiffel Tower?   You smile.\r\n\r\nIt’s emblazoned in gold, no less, and the letters are two feet tall!  You scoff.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a tall tale, an unverifiable brag.  But, in a manner of speaking, after a fashion, in a sense only slightly less than literal, it happens to be true.\r\n\r\nOn the Eiffel Tower, are engraved, in honor of their contributions, the names of 72 French scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.\r\n\r\nGustave Eiffel chose this “invocation of science” in response to the protests against the tower when it was being constructed.  The sight of it horrified most  Parisians.  To them it appeared to be a grotesquely stylized human form, an armless, shoulderless giant with splayed legs, enormous feet, and a tiny head.  “Yes, but,” Eiffel said in effect, “it’s also a monument to the scientific prowess of France.”\r\n\r\nThe tower was to have been a temporary fixture, installed for the 1889 World’s Fair.  It survived only because of its potential as a radio tower when it became clear that radio was ‘the coming thing.’\r\n\r\nThe engraved names are found on all four sides under the first balcony.\r\n\r\nMy family name appears on the northeast side, also known as La Bourdonnais side.   When you stand there, next time you’re in Paris, gazing up in wonder, your back will be  toward the upstream direction of the Seine.  \r\n\r\n“Gosh!” you’ll exclaim (if you are among those who continue, at such moments, to employ that quaint expression), “Rick wasn’t kidding!”\r\n\r\nSome of the names emblazoned there remain famous today:  Lavoisier, Ampère, Daguerre and, yes, Sauvage, my ancestral family name.  (The origin of “Sowash” is the French name “Sauvage.”  My branch of the family changed the spelling in the 1840’s.)\r\n\r\nFor 25 years I thought that the name represented Frédéric Sauvage, who in 1832 showed that his invention, the screw propeller, could propel a boat through water more efficiently than the then-standard paddle-wheels attached to the sides of a boat.  He first demonstrated this great leap in the science of hydro-dynamics during a public demonstration in the bay of Honfleur, a harbor town on the coast of Normandy.  Our family read about him on a plaque alongside the quay there during our ten-week visit to France in 1994.  \r\n\r\n“Gosh!” we said and have honored the achievements of “Uncle Fred” ever since.\r\n\r\nI recently discovered, however, that my assumption was wrong.  The Sauvage on the Eiffel tower is not “Uncle Fred” but rather François Clément Sauvage, a geologist and mining engineer.  “Cousin Frank,” we call him now.  \r\n\r\nHaving my name, by a stretch, emblazoned, so to speak, in gold on the Eiffel Tower gives me, I admit, the merest toehold in the Pantheon of the great men and women of French descent whose names ‘echo down the corridors of Time.’  \r\n\r\nIn the vast Francophone world it is a footnote, a barnacle, a smidgen, a crumb, a speck.  \r\n\r\nStill … it’s a fun story to tell.  It makes me feel just a little more French.  \r\n\r\nGosh!  Or should I say, Mon Dieu?\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement of my Trio #1 for Clarinet, Cello & Piano "Voyage of the Spirit” performed by the French ensemble “les Gavottes” (clarinetist Lucien Aubert, cellist François Adloff and pianist Jean Tatu), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nI''d love to know what you think about this music; reply if you''re inclined.  But please don''t feel that you are expected to reply.  I''m just glad to share my work in this way.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n“We are all on a voyage and none of us has arrived.”  That’s what our former pastor, Rev. Steve Van Kuiken, often told us.\r\n\r\nI had that in mind in 1998, when I wrote my first trio for clarinet, cello and piano, aspiring to describe a spiritual journey by utilizing, not words, but the gestures of music.\r\n\r\nA journey must begin somewhere.  The first movement is lovely, dark and mysterious.  Despite our keen awareness of the beauty of the world, of life, of the precious here and now, we yearn for something else, something more.  Reconciling this divergence is how we advance toward serenity, resigned yet radiant.  \r\n\r\nI strive for serenity.  Am I serene?  My wife would know.  Ask her;  she will laugh.  “Not often,” she might say and she would be right.  The same malicious imps that pester you pester me:  resentment, regret, anxiety, worry.  “Go away,” I tell them and it works … for a while. \r\n\r\nThe second movement evokes the attempt most of us make to find meaning in Life through romantic love and, afterwards, through nostalgia. \r\n\r\nA crisis comes in the third movement, when the instruments intone an ancient “Alleluia,” an important part of the Lutheran liturgy in the church of my boyhood.  It moved me then and the memory of it moves me now.  We fall away from Faith and then return.  That’s part of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe fourth movement starts out to be an exuberant, joyful finale as if to say, “We have arrived!”  Not so.  Doubt and mystery are soon felt again; the mysterious music of the first movement recurs, interrupting the exuberance.  The music falters, the journey almost stops.  Only the dark ruminations of the cello keep the piece alive.  \r\n\r\nThen comes an affirmation, a blessing, and the piece ends -- not with a strong, positive gesture, not with a Beethoven ending, but rather with a slowing, fading, rising gesture, ambiguously suggesting both resolution and non-resolution.  It seems to say, “The music ceases, but the voyage continues and none of us have arrived."\r\n\r\nToday, I invite you to listen to the beautiful, strange opening movement.  It uses harmonic progressions we remember from Bach.  His music compels us to love these progressions, even when employed by another, far lesser composer.  The music is cast in 7/4, a meter unknown to Bach.  Each phrase of the tune has a symmetrical structure:  four notes played first as quarter notes, then repeated as eighth notes, then sixteenth notes — and then in reverse — the next four notes are played as sixteenth notes, then eighth notes, then quarter notes.  This is the music of deliberate ambiguity:  is it slow or fast?  Not even that is clear.\r\n\r\nThough I did not know it in 1998, this trio turned out to be the beginning of a much larger journey for me.  The subtitle, “Journey of the Spirit,” was prophetic:  this was the first of fifteen works I wrote for clarinet, cello & piano, far more than I’ve written for any other combination of instruments.  \r\n\r\nI became fascinated, even obsessed, with exploring the metaphors presented by a clarinet, a cello and a piano.  The fifteen trios, considered as a whole, comprise a zig-zagging trajectory culminating in my clarinet concerto, my magnum opus, perhaps the best of all my works.\r\n\r\nTo hear the first movement performed by “les Gavottes,” the French trio for whom it was written, (clarinetist Lucien Aubert, celist François Adloff and pianist Jean Tatu), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),54);

It’s been like that almost since he learned to talk.  I never have to explain to him what I think or feel; he already knows.\r\n\r\nWe have a great deal in common and a few differences.  I''m religious, he’s not.  He has no religious practices, never prays so far as I know.  He goes to church only when he''s a paid soloist (trombone) or once in a while as a favor to me when one of my anthems is being performed in the service.  \r\n\r\nAnd yet …\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I said to him, “You’re thirty years old.  You’ve had some experience of Life.  I’d like to ask you a question to which there are three possible responses.  I’m curious to know which response you’d embrace.”\r\n\r\n“OK,” he said, immediately intrigued, sensing Big Stuff.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe,” I asked, “that, A, the universe is prejudiced against your development, actively opposing the flowering of your talents, stifling your efforts to fulfill your destiny by bringing your gifts to the wider world?  \r\n\r\n"Or … do you believe that, B, the universe is indifferent, neither opposing nor supporting your efforts?  \r\n\r\n"Or … do you believe that, C, the universe is prejudiced in favor of your development and actively assists and encourages your efforts, opening doors and seeing to it that one opportunity leads to the next?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go with the third option,” he said, immediately.\r\n\r\nI nodded.  “Then you have all the religion you’ll ever need.”\r\n\r\nEmbracing the third option is the essence of religion, it seems to me.  The accoutrements — scriptures, steeples, sanctuaries, sacraments — are finnimbruns, finicky finnimbruns.  Lovely, charming, stirring even -- but ancillary.\r\n\r\nI love how Odell Shepard expresses this ’third option’ in his quiet book, The Cabin Down the Glen. He wrote the words below in the 1930’s.  Can you look beyond the dated sexism of his pronouns to the era-transcending wisdom of his thought?  \r\n\r\n	"The faith … has only one article in its creed:  that there is an inexhaustible spring in the meadow of the world upon which we may draw for all that we need.  There is some Power ... waiting to help, to cheer, and to guide us.  I do not care to name it now, for all names are limitations, but I believe that each of the great worships of the world has been addressed to this Power, has been the rediscovery by some direct and penetrative mind of a truth that all right-living men have always dimly known.  …  Here is the tap-root of the tree of religion; from this all the pantheons have sprung. ...  A man who has this faith has religion, no matter what may be his creed or his lack of one."\r\n\r\nI’ve written a fair amount of sacred vocal music:  hymns and anthems intended to be sung in worship services at my beloved Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church, an enclave of progressive Christians, just a mile up the hill from my home in downtown Cincinnati.  I know that my fellow congregants, most of whom receive these weekly emails, will embrace Mr. Shepard’s words.  Maybe I will set those words to music and sing them in church sometime.\r\n\r\nYet some of my instrumental pieces are also charged with a feeling I''d term religious.\r\n\r\nOne such is the second of my Three Piquant Pieces for oboe & strings, titled simply, “Adagio." \r\n\r\nTo hear this “Adagio” beautifully played by oboist Amy Dennison, violinist Marion Peraza de Web, violist Katherine Cinelli and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJanuary 8, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nA solo wind instrument heard over a ‘cushion’ of strings is, to me, the most appealing of all musical textures.  Especially when the instrument is an oboe.\r\n\r\nAh, the oboe.  That strange, lovely, piercing sound.  Unlike the chameleon clarinet, which I adore, the oboe offers only one color but it is poignant and touches our hearts in a way that unique.  Who can explain exactly why this particular sound appeals to us as much as it does?  It’s a mystery.  We only know it’s true.  \r\n\r\nI wrote “Three Piquant Pieces” for oboe and strings when I was 27, revising it when I was 41.\r\n\r\nWhen I was young, indiscriminately in love with my own ideas, I jammed as many as possible into a piece of music.  They were intriguing, but they were presented in a crowded jumble; they came at you, thick and fast. \r\n\r\nRevising later, I expanded the space between the ideas so that they can breathe and be perceived more fully and clearly.  \r\n\r\nHere’s an example.  Today’s mp3 begins with the oboe playing a melancholy, descending line during the first four measures.  Then the oboe stops playing and the strings do a little rhythmical business before the oboe resumes\r\n\r\nWhen I was 27, that tiny interlude of business in the strings wasn’t there.  The oboe simply went right ahead, from the first to the second phrase. It was too much, too soon.  I inserted that little ‘business’ in the strings very deliberately.  They interrupt the oboe and comment on the opening phrase.  See?  That little interruption recurs, in the revised version, throughout the movement, each time allowing both the music, the listeners and the oboist to catch a breath.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem a tad clinical?  Closer to surgery than artistry?  Remember, revision is undertaken to enhance the emotional effect.  This music is wistful, reflective, lovely but sad.  Inserting those little interludes of rhythmical business makes it seem as if the oboe is a little hesitant and shy, a little reluctant to share her sorrow, perhaps afraid of being perceived as self-pitying.  \r\n\r\nDoes that sound familiar?  Are you like that?  I am.  When my friends ask how I’m doing, the easiest response is to put on a show of ebullience and, if I can, to say something funny in the hope of eliciting a smile or a laugh.  I seldom share my sadness, isolation, or my fear of being discarded.  And when I do, it doesn’t come out in a rush, but hesitantly, with pauses between sentences, like the oboe between phrases, as I grope for the words.\r\n\r\nRevising isn’t cold and calculating.  It renders the music more personal, more humane.\r\n\r\nTo hear the first movement, “Lento” from Three Piquant Pieces played by oboist Amy Dennison, violinist Marion Peraza de Web, violist Katherine Cinelli and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the full score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),46);

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(74,replace(replace('Hello — \r\n\r\n“I don’t know much about classical music,” said a new friend as I placed my CDs in his hands.\r\n\r\nl felt a bit crestfallen.\r\n\r\nGifted with a collection of short stories, would he have said, “I don’t know much about short stories”?  \r\n\r\nGifted with a drawing, would he have said, “I don’t know much about drawings”?\r\n\r\nPalms uplifted, I assured him, “You don’t have to know anything.  Just listen.”\r\n\r\nMany Americans are less than confident about their ability to grasp so-called ‘classical music.’  .  The very phrase ‘classical music’ suggests that there are “insiders” and “outsiders” and that, when it comes to music like this, if you’re not an “insider,” you can "fuh-GED-about-it.”\r\n\r\nHigh walls, not of my making, shut out many people from the kind of music I’ve aspired to write, the tradition I’ve tried to carry forward on my own terms, in my own time.  \r\n\r\nThis was forcibly brought to my attention early on, back in 1970, when I landed a summer job ‘riding shotgun’ on a Stroh’s beer truck.  One of the drivers, Ed, loved music and we talked about it a lot.  Ed told me, “Your kind of music has no stories.”  I asked him what he meant.  \r\n\r\nHe turned on the radio and we listened for a little while.  “See?” he said.  “She’s a waitress in a truck stop and she’s had her heart broke.  Along comes this good-lookin’ trucker and she’s tryin'' to decide if she should make a pass at him.  It’s a story, you got to give it that.”\r\n\r\nIt was a story, sure enough.  In all the works of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, you won’t find anything like it.\r\n\r\nEd wasn’t a fool.  He was kindly, thoughtful, soft-spoken and hard-working.  Though he would not have used the word, what he wanted from music was humanity.  To be sure, the music of Beethoven and the rest offers plenty of humanity, but Ed would not have perceived it there; he needed a story.\r\n\r\nOur conversations made me think, gave me some perspective on what I was being taught as a music composition major at the university School of Music to which I returned when the summer ended.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry; I didn’t start writing C & W songs.  But I realized that programmatic titles welcome listeners in search of a story.  A piece of music entitled “Deep Forest” is more likely to engage  listeners than the same piece would if it were entitled “Sonata.”  \r\n\r\nI renewed the respect I’d had as a child for the expressive power of simple triads and traditional chord progressions.  I came to see why certain tunes are so well-known and well-loved:  hymns, marches, the songs that were sung in those days by the great Pete Seeger (he’d have been protesting yesterday, as I was, here in Cincinnati, along with 7,000 others) and the handful of songs that “everybody knows,” like Take Me Out to the Ballgame and Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\r\n\r\nA few years later, I found my voice as a composer, the result of all I’d learned, heard and pondered.\r\n\r\nFor the next four decades I wrote music that is … what?  “Classical?”  \r\n\r\nThere’s that pesky word again.  Ugh.\r\n\r\nA Vermont cellist recently emailed me, describing my music as “tuneful while unmistakably of our time (not imitation classical).”\r\n\r\nNot imitation classical.  I like that.  I’ve often groped for a phrase that would summarize my life’s work.  A laconic Vermonter came close! \r\n\r\nStill, good as it is, it’s a mouthful, a string of words.  \r\n\r\nGregg Smith, the celebrated choral director, told me that my music was “folky but not hokey.”  \r\n\r\nThat’s short and funny and it even rhymes.  But it still doesn''t quite fly as an answer to the question, “What kind of music do you write?”   \r\n\r\nI wish a description of my work could be conveyed in a single, widely-understood word.  \r\n\r\nSorry.  The closest word we have is ... “classical."\r\n\r\nThe music I want to share with you today is pretty, triadic and simple.  It’s "folky but not hokey.”  It’s "not imitation classical.”  All well and good.  Even so, it “doesn’t have a story” or even a programmatic title.  I wonder if Ed would have liked it.  \r\n\r\nTo hear The Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) performing the sixth movement of my Piano Trio #3, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJanuary 22, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA friend remarked that although our city is avid for all kinds of music, there doesn''t seem to be “a Cincinnati sound.”\r\n\r\nI''d humbly suggest that, for better or worse, my music has an Ohio sound, and, yes, a Cincinnati sound. \r\n\r\nSince my early twenties I have earnestly tried to write a music that expresses  the region where I live.  I have been a Regionalist composer, just as Willa Cather is a Regionalist writer and Grant Wood is a Regionalist painter.\r\n\r\nWhy do I fancy that my music sounds "Ohioan" or "Cincinnatian?"\r\n\r\nIt is immediately identifiable as American music.  Stylistically, it''s in the same neck of the woods as Copland, Barber, Gershwin, etc.  It doesn''t sound European.  Politically, culturally, economically, Ohio is the bellwether state for our country.  Musically, too.  That’s why an Ohio music has to sound American.\r\n\r\nThe contours of my tunes are neither Alpine nor Saharan.  They rise and fall gently, modestly, like the slopes of rural Ohio or the Seven Hills of Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nMy harmonies are based in hymnody.  Church is the place where most Ohioans hear most of the music that might be termed ‘serious.’   Even ‘the unchurched’ hear intentionally serious music in sacred spaces when they attend weddings or funerals in a sanctuary.\r\n\r\nDissonance?  In my music, it''s a condiment, used sparingly, like the seasoning in our best local artisanal sausage or Cincinnati chili.\r\n\r\nLike Ohio and Cincinnati, there is nothing ''avant garde'' about my music.  (Au contraire, Monsieur!  Ma musique est derrière garde!)\r\n\r\nThe rhythms are even, four-square, jerky only occasionally, for comic effect.  Fluid and supple, never obsessive, fascistic.  The rhythm of life is like that in Ohio.  I should know, having lived here from the git-go.\r\n\r\nThe orchestration, relative to the Fauvist colors of so much contemporary music is lavender gray.\r\n\r\nAs for the craft, the structure, the architecture of my music, it’s ‘by the book.’  I have played by the rules.  If the sonata allegro form was good enough for Beethoven, it was good enough for me.\r\n\r\nMy life’s work is optimistic, courteous, considerate of the listener.  It’s open and friendly, what you would expect from a good Midwestern boy, properly brought up.  \r\n\r\nMy music is not that of a crotchety, reticent New Englander.  Nor a granola-fed Colorado backpacker nor a sleepy Southerner nor a California dreamer nor an experimental, coastal urbanite.  There are such composers and I say more power to ‘em.  \r\n\r\nThe musical experimentalism that flourishes on the coasts would not express what we are about, here in the Midwest.  My music is, I fancy, if nothing else,  authentic, the square, honest, centrist, what-ya-hear-is-what-ya-get music of the Heartland.  \r\n\r\nAnecdote:  A very pregnant lady boards a crowded subway car.  A young man immediately springs to his feet, offering his seat.  Settling herself, she thanks him, then posits, "You must be a daddy."  His imperishable reply:\r\n\r\n				"No, Ma''am. I''m from the Midwest."\r\n\r\nThat is how my music seems to me.\r\n\r\nTo my way of thinking, for what it''s worth, my music defines and exemplifies a Cincinnati sound, an Ohio sound.\r\n\r\nThat and $4.75 will get me a cup of hazelnut mocha coconutmilk macchiata at the nearest Starbucks!\r\n\r\nTo hear The Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) performing the first movement of my Piano Trio #3 with Midwestern freshness and zest, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAfter I shared, in one of these weekly e-pistles, a movement from my solo cello suite, a cellist friend wrote:\r\n\r\n	“If I were playing it, I would do it with a stricter rhythm, less rubato, making the meter more clear.”\r\n\r\nGlad to have heard from her, I happily replied, neither blessing nor deprecating her ideas.  I merely explained that, however the recording had turned out, it was, quoting the old cowboy song “Git Along Lil Dogie,” the soloist’s "misfortune and none of my own.”  I had had no occasion to confer, converse and otherwise hob-nob with the soloist before the recording was graven for all eternity onto 1,000 plastic compact discs.\r\n\r\nThis lack of an occasion to confer, converse and otherwise hob-nob was just as well, as I almost never offer opinions as to how my music ought to be performed.  I avoid such encounters.  \r\n\r\nOne of the many reasons I have remained close friends with my church choir director, Chris Miller, despite his having conducted numerous performances of my music, is that when he rehearses one of anthems with our choir, I never tell him how to do his job.  \r\n\r\nIf asked, I will gladly explain what the lyrics mean to me and/or recount how the piece came to be written.  But the choice of tempo, dynamics, articulation and what not, I leave to Chris.  I may be guilty of having composed the music but in rehearsal, I am just an innocent tenor; Chris is the director. \r\n\r\nWhen musicians ask me, “Do you want it played like THIS?”  (tum tee tum, tee tum) “Or like THIS?” (tee tum tee, tum tee), I am almost never know what to say.  Sometimes I cannot even discern the difference.  Too, I’ve noticed that when I do come down in favor of one or t’other, the musicians often seem puzzled and distressed by my pronouncement.  “Oh, really?” they say, with an air of bewilderment.  If I’m honest and tell them that I haven’t a clue and that we might as well flip a coin to decide, they say, “But you wrote it.  You must have some ideas.”  Gulp.  They are probably right; I ought to have some ideas.  But the truth is, I don’t.\r\n\r\nA conductor once took me me to task for this, ascribing my reticence to the characteristically Midwestern disinclination to seem unfriendly or impolite.  He said, “You must INFLICT your ideas upon musicians!”  Inflict?  Golly Ned.  The idea of inflicting anything on anybody gives me the Willies.\r\n\r\nOnce, many years ago, when I was young and foolish, I micro-managed a pianist’s recording of “The Unicorn,” one of my best pieces for solo piano.  Every measure and phrase was shaped just the way I wanted it.  I insisted on having my way; the pianist was compliant.  \r\n\r\nI was pleased with the result until someone sent me a recording of “The Unicorn” which they had made all on their own.  It was so much more frisky and blithesome than the version I had supervised that I have abjured supervising recordings of my music ever since.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, it’s not the interpretation that’s in question but the instrument itself.  I am both pained and amused when I recall the behavior of a certain singer for whom I had written a song cycle, eventually persuading her to record the work.  I rented an acoustically perfect little chapel, deep in the Iowa countryside, a ‘church in the wildwood,’ far from the oompus-boompus of the madding crowd.  I hired an accompanist and an engineer; the three of us lugged his recording equipment from his van into the chapel and helped him assemble it.\r\n\r\nWhen the singer arrived, I was surprised to see how much weight she had gained.  Not that it was significant, musically, I thought.  The first thing she said was, “I don’t think you realize how much my voice has changed since you wrote this cycle for me.  Nowadays, my tone is much darker.  I have more of a ”Tosca” voice.  What you want for this piece is a lighter voice, more like “Papageno.”  \r\n\r\nI had only the vaguest idea what she was talking about but i said, “I’m sure your voice will be just fine," politely, reassuringly, ever the friendly Midwesterner.\r\n\r\nShe said, “Let’s try it once, just to warm up and then you must tell me what you honestly think.”\r\n\r\nThe accompanist played the introduction while I sat in the front row pew, a copy of the score on my lap, a goofy Midwestern smile on my face.  The singer took a deep breath and let it rip.  I jerked back my head, eyes wide.  I thought she was joking, impersonating the clichéd nightmare of a Wagnerian soprano, belting out my delicate song in chesty tones and a vibrato commensurate with the newly-acquired breadth of her beam.\r\n\r\nAt length, she finished.  “Now be honest,” she said.  "What do you think?”\r\n\r\nIt was a delicate situation.  I needed a moment to choose my words.  “I was just wondering,” I ventured, making little qualifying circles with my left hand, “if you could try to sing it just a little more lightly.”\r\n\r\nShe took umbrage.  She picked up the sheet music, lifted it over her head, then flung it to the floor, scattering the pages.  It was umbrage, alright.  A clear case of umbrage.  She stomped out of the chapel in a huff, a full-blown hissy-fit, a state of high dudgeon.  \r\n\r\nWe heard her car roar out of the church’s parking lot and a minute-and-a-huff later the sound of its engine was superseded by the ceaseless silence that pervades the furthest fastnesses of remotest Iowa.  The accompanist, the engineer and I blinked at one another, sighed, disassembled the equipment and returned it to the van.  I never saw or heard from the singer again.   \r\n\r\nI had to wait fifteen years until another singer, possessing the lighter voice that was “right” for the cycle, recorded it — and very beautifully, too.\r\n\r\nI had no hand in shaping that interpretation, nor the other interpretations recorded on my CDs.  If some of the interpretations seem better than others, credit the musicians, not the undersigned.\r\n\r\nLet’s listen to the incomparable Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) playing the third movement from my Piano Trio #3 by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nSeven times, I’ve read The Lord of the Rings.  Probably that''s enough.  \r\n\r\nI dip into it now and again, when I need to hang out with Tom Bombadil, Treebeard or Gandalf.  \r\n\r\nNo re-reading of the entire trilogy, today, could bring the delight I felt in reading the whole shebang aloud to my son, Chapman, when he was seven years old.  He was totally smitten and begged, almost every evening, to hear a little more of the tale.  It took us seven months to finish!  It’s one of my fondest memories.\r\n\r\nI remember his delight, his unease, his suspicions, his deductions, as he projected ahead in the plot, intuiting possibilities from Tolkien''s hints.  \r\n\r\nVivid-est of all, is my memory of Chap''s reaction when Gandalf seemingly dies, bested by the Balrog and disappearing with that foul demon into the unimaginable depths of Moria, the long lost underground dwarf kingdom.\r\n\r\nChap, poor little guy, was terribly upset.  He wept and sobbed, piteously.  I didn’t know what to do.  It was impossible to continue reading.  I put my arm around his little, quaking shoulders and patted him with both hands.  “There, there,” I said.  “People come and go in our lives … and in the world … and in books.”  He wailed all the more.  It was perhaps not the best thing to say.  He was afflicted.  I tried to think if I had ever found myself in such a situation and what I had done to comfort the distressed.\r\n\r\nThen it came to me.  In a soft, sad voice, I ventured, “Chappy, Gandalf the Gray is gone and we’ll never meet him again.  But … there is also ... GANDALF THE WHITE!”   \r\n\r\nInstantly radiant with hope, he jerked his face toward me, his little nose inches from mine.  He was amazed.  He beamed, joy shining through the tears that still gleamed and slid, glistening, down his cheeks.  \r\n\r\nHe cried out, “You mean he comes back?”  \r\n\r\n“Yes!”  \r\n\r\nHe pointed his little forefinger at the book and shouted, “KEEP READING!”\r\n\r\nWhat a moment.  He felt things so deeply, so sincerely.  Such a sweet boy.  And now a sweet man, I’m proud to say.\r\n\r\nChap imposed one rule.  He insisted that, when I read aloud to him, as I did many, many times, I must read the text PRECISELY as written, even if it included words he was unlikely to have encountered.  \r\n\r\nAs I often read to him from books that were over the head of most seven-year-olds, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, The Wind in the Willows, Three Men in a Boat, we would often come upon words that I knew he would  not understand.  If I tried to gloss over them or substitute a simpler synonym, he stopped me, every time.  He would never stand for it!\r\n\r\n“No!” he would command.  “Read exactly what’s there!  Don’t change a single thing!”  I finally learned my lesson and obeyed his rule, even when I knew there was scant chance of his understanding.  It was a point of pride with him.  He didn’t want to be treated like a baby.\r\n\r\nHis vocabulary grew, became amazing for a person his age.  In the years since, he''s popped out Big Words as if they ain’t nothin’.  \r\n\r\nHe has reported that when he was ‘on the road,’ on long tours with bands (trombonist extraordinaire, he toured America and Europe multiple times), sometimes the other musicians, filling the long hours in the band’s van, en route to the next gig, would say to him, “Talk, Chap, just talk.  We love to hear you talk.”  \r\n\r\nI know what they meant.  People love to hear Chap talk.  He expresses his thoughts, feelings and ideas in unique and colorful ways, sometimes even inventing the words he needs as he goes along.  Words like “assumedly.”\r\n\r\nHow have the English-speaking peoples gotten so far without the word “assumedly?”\r\n\r\nGandalf is dear to me; he''s the man I want to be.  Merry and wise.  An Old Guy that can still hack it.  I tell my students that I am their school’s “oldest living teacher, the Gandalf of “Leaves of Learning.”  (That’s the name of the school.)\r\n\r\nMy claim to Gandalf-like status is not altogether fanciful.  Master of what is, to my students, arcane knowledge, demonstrably accomplished in arts that seem esoteric to them (I teach French and Music Theory), given to shrewd quips, cagey discernments and the not infrequent rendering of affectionate sarcasms, having lived five times as many years as they and twice as many as their parents, quoting the Great Masters, occasionally reciting entire poems from memory, having thrived in a wide range of settings, experiencing adventures they can scarcely imagine, as they took place far beyond the boundaries of their world (the school is their Shire), I believe my claim to being the Gandalf of “Leaves of Learning” is well-founded.\r\n\r\nThat is why, this coming Wednesday, when the students are invited to celebrate Hallowe’en by arriving in costume, I will once again don, to the delight of all and sundry, my make-shift Gandalf get-up.  \r\n\r\nAssumedly, you would now enjoy hearing some suitably ‘mock-spooky’ music for Hallowe’en.  \r\n\r\nAssumedly!  \r\n\r\nTo hear The Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) performing the first movement of my Piano Trio #3 with their customary verve, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you believe in fairies?  Do I?\r\n\r\n(Now please don’t roll your eyes and say, “Oh, brrrrother!")\r\n\r\nTheir laughter reached my ears in western Pennsylvania, of all places, at least fifty miles away from the nearest production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”  \r\n\r\nI was forced to conclude that they were laughing at me, since every time it happened, I was the only mortal within earshot.\r\n\r\nThink me bonkers?  \r\n\r\nForthwith, a scrupulously true account of how it came to pass.\r\n\r\n					*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nThe late Colin Fletcher’s books, most notably The Thousand Mile Summer, inspired legions of backpackers, my younger self among them.  He extolls remote places where he walked for weeks, finding solace in solitude.   \r\n\r\nIt sounded good to me.  I resolved to hike, solo, the 80-mile Laurel Highlands Trail which creeps across the ridges of the Allegheny mountains in western PA.\r\n\r\nThus, in June of 1989, my good wife deposited me and my backpack at the northern end of the trail, near Johnstown.  She would meet me eight days later and eighty miles southwest, in Ohiopyle.  \r\n\r\nThough less well known than the Appalachian Trail, the Laurel Highlands Trail is a popular backpacker’s trek.  I expected to encounter other hikers and I anticipated the pleasure of comparing notes, catching up on the gossip of the trail, complaining about our heavy packs and the weather, giving the fat a good chew and the breeze a good shoot.\r\n\r\nBut all during that first day, I saw no other hikers, no people, not a one.  \r\n\r\nI was alone.\r\n\r\nI have loved reading about the joys of solitude.  Fletcher, Thoreau, Odell Shepard, Annie Dillard, these writers'' rhapsodies on solitude have swept me along, page after page.  \r\n\r\nBut actual solitude?  A little goes a long way.  I can tolerate a few hours of solitude when Jo is out, running errands, “bopping around town,” as she puts it.  I read, I write, I watch a documentary.  \r\n\r\nAs an occasional condiment alongside the meat-and-potatoes of a sociable life, solitude is tolerable, even pleasant in small doses.  But solitude as an entrée?  No thanks.  Who wants a bowl of salt and pepper?  Give me people.  That’s the entrée I crave.  Give me lots and lots of interesting, curious, passionate, quirky people, like my chums at church and my students at school.\r\n\r\nOddly, it’s a yearning for people that draws me to writers like Fletcher, Thoreau, et al.  I cherish their company.  They bring us into their presence; they gift us with the opportunity to get to know them, to discover what they think and feel.  Their subject may be solitude but it''s their companionship we relish, their wit, their passion, their wisdom, their delight in a well-turned phrase.\r\n\r\nAlone in the woods of western PA on the first day of my trek, I had none of that.  Evening came.  I arrived at the first of a string of shelter areas, each about a dozen miles apart, in which I would pass the next seven nights.  \r\n\r\nThe silence was heavy, brooding.  "It was as though the trees were making secret preparations ... I felt that I was watched by many things at once and from all sides.” (I’m quoting Odell Shepard, describing what he terms “the terror of solitude.") \r\n\r\nI cooked and ate my supper, read my Shakespeare, said my prayers and fell asleep well before dark.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, snug in my sleeping bag, my drowsy eyes opened to a world of ferns.  Ferns!  A wealth of ferns, a fronded wealth, green and golden in the light of dawn, a knee-high bounty, overspreading the forest floor.\r\n\r\nThe ferns were mine to harvest, visually, all day long, as I traveled south on ’shank’s mare.''  In the slanting, yellowy morning light, tiny, numberless globules of dew, each a glittering gem, glistening and buttery, clung to every frond-tip.  All week I walked, breathed, lived among ferns, golden in the morning, Kelly green in the afternoon light, gradually graying as the evening light faded.\r\n\r\nDid you know that for millions of years ferns were the only plants on our planet?  Think of it!  A strange and beautiful world of gigantic ferns — and only ferns!  — a High Renaissance of ferns.  Today, the humble little ferns malingering in the shady corners of our yards are the last remnant of a monarchic dynasty that once ruled the floral world exclusively, seemingly by a Divine Right.\r\n\r\nFerns.  I love them so.\r\n\r\nAll during that second morning I expected to encounter hikers, tramping toward me or overtaking me on the trail.  Instead, I had the trail all to myself, all day.\r\n\r\nAbout noon I suddenly heard, not far behind me, what sounded like a short burst of high-pitched laughter, light and playful.  It was precisely the sort of laughter that erupts when pre-pubescent boys are wrestling, tussling and tumbling, locked in mock-combat, like puppies at play.  I thought immediately that it must be a Boy Scout troop, hiking the trail.  I’m an Eagle Scout and a former Scoutmaster; it would be fun to greet my fellow Scouts and ask them about their troop and their trip.\r\n\r\nI stopped and turned to look behind me, waiting for them to appear.  They did not.  There was no one in sight and no more laughter, only the hushed murmur of the woods.\r\n\r\nWeird, I thought.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as I was making my supper, alone in a shelter area, I heard it again.  It was so vivid, so convincing, that i stood up and responded with a joyful shout of greeting: “Hello!”\r\n\r\nNothing.  No answer.  No one.\r\n\r\nStrange, I thought.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, I traveled on without a single human contact, the longest stint of solitude I had ever endured.  Twice, before noon on the third day, I heard the laughter again, once a little ahead of me and once perhaps fifty yards off to the side.  \r\n\r\nMysterious, I thought.  \r\n\r\nThree times that afternoon.  Once more while I was making my supper in the shelter area and another, one last time, as I was falling asleep.  Always the same high-pitched, light and playful laughter.\r\n\r\nEerie, I thought.\r\n\r\nWhat was going on?  \r\n\r\nI think it was the aural equivalent of seeing the profile of a human face in a cloud formation.  A random Rohrschach test for the ears which we will interpret in whatever way suits our memory, our experience of life.\r\n\r\nAs I walked along, half-conscious of my aural environment, the forest would suddenly emit some random sound — perhaps branches squeaking as they rubbed together in a light breeze, the barely discernible sound of a limb dropping from a distant tree, a chipmunk at play in the leaves behind me or ahead of me — and my brain, being human, would  interpret the noise in a way that would make sense to a human being, the sort interpretation one would expect to emanate from a human consciousness.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of the sound as human laughter may also have the resulted from three days of uninterrupted and increasingly bothersome solitude.  I was hungering for human contact.  My consciousness wanted a random sound to have human origin.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day, a Saturday, I came on some people, at last.  Two young couples.  Silly gigglers with nothing much to say, they delighted me.  It felt good to be with people again.  What they said didn’t matter; hearing their voices made me smile.\r\n\r\nAfter that, during the four remaining days of the hike, I came upon people several times a day.  I never again heard that peculiar, high, light, boyish laughter, not on that hike nor in the years that followed. \r\n\r\nLooking back, I think I may have stumbled into one of the primal adventures of the human race.  Alone in the woods for a time, we humans begin hearing voices.  Casting about for an explanation, we’ve sometimes advanced the notion that there ‘little people’ out there in the woods.  It’s an enduring idea and it has flourished in all corners of the globe.  We recall the fairies of England, the gnomes of Norway, the imps, goblins and dwarves of the Black Forest, the leprechauns of the Emerald Isle and the Menehune of Hawaii.\r\n\r\n(Hawaiian legend has it that many centuries ago, the Menehune were a mischievous, diminutive people, who lived hidden in the forests of the islands before the first settlers arrived from Polynesia.  Some say that they linger still in Hawaii’s remotest corners.) \r\n\r\nHobbits?  Fiction, yes.  Or should I say ‘Fiction, perhaps''?  I don’t know anyone who has met a hobbit but it is well to remember what Tolkien tells us:  hobbits are very good at not being seen.  I can think of many reasons why hobbits would wish steer clear of troublous human beings.\r\n\r\nIn “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” the fairies are real enough, right there in front of us on the stage, living and breathing, flesh and blood.  We meet Oberon, his servant Puck, Titania and her attendants Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth and Mustardseed and others who are unnamed.  They are in plain sight for the audience, yet are never seen nor heard by the mortals in the play, save Bottom and even he can’t be sure, afterwards, whether his encounter with the fairies was real or a dream.   \r\n\r\n“Lord, what fools these mortals be!” says Puck.\r\n\r\nI was luckier than Helena, Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius and the rest.  \r\n\r\nI have never seen the fairies, but I heard them laugh, once upon a time, long ago, in western Pennsylvania ...\r\n\r\nIf composers have offended\r\nThink but this, and all is mended,\r\nWe have but lullabye’d you here\r\nWhile these ditties did appear.\r\nWith our weak and idle theme\r\nWe lulled you all into a dream.\r\nListeners, do not reprehend.\r\nIf you pardon, we will mend,\r\nElse Sowash a liar call, \r\nSo, good night unto you all.\r\nLend your ears, if we be friends.\r\nLet our sweet tunes restore amends. \r\n\r\nOne of my most Puck-ish compositions is the very short fourth movement from my Piano Trio #3, “A Christmas Divertimento."

When we’re at it, time stands still.  It gives meaning and purpose to our lives.  It is beyond price.  And the ideas just keep coming.  Where from?  Where were they yesterday?  Who can say?  And all our ideas come to us for free.  Incredible.\r\n\r\nI don’t think it’s WRONG to profit from creative work.  Indeed, I’ve done it all my life and I still accept contributions, a salary for my teaching, income from the sale of my books and CDs and fees for my speaking engagements.  I’m only too happy to deposit the modest royalties ASCAP sends me every quarter.\r\n\r\nStill, I decided, six years ago, when I began to share these weekly emails with friends, to give away my life’s work to the greatest extent possible.\r\n\r\nWhat, to ameliorate ’the Willies''?  No.  There are other, better reasons.\r\n\r\nImagine that we''re standing near a bramble of wild blackberry bushes, you and me.  If I pick a blackberry and pop it in my mouth, chew it up and swallow it, then that blackberry is … a certain kind of thing.  Bear with me here.\r\n\r\nNow suppose I picked that same blackberry and said to you, “Hey, will you pay me a nickel for this blackberry?”  The glistening little fruit has now become a different thing than it was in the previous instance.  It looks the same, smells the same, tastes the same.  It has the same name.  Nevertheless, it has changed.  Spiritually, it has become something else.  Through no fault of its own, it has been diminished.\r\n\r\nTrying to sell a blackberry which came to us for free changes the blackberry, our relationship to it and our relationship with one another.  Not for the better.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to sell something alters the thing that is being offered for sale as well as the friendship and mutual trust that may exist between the potential seller and the prospective buyer.  This is especially true when both parties know that the thing being offered came to the seller for free.\r\n\r\nIdeas, blackberries, sunlight, moonlight and a great many other good things come to us for free.  The universe provides them.  \r\n\r\n“And I or you pocketless of a dime, may purchase the pick of the earth,” says Walt Whitman, ardent, jaunty and wise all at once, as usual.\r\n\r\nThere may be a third way of disposing a blackberry I’ve picked.  I have said, “If you’ll give me a nickel for this blackberry, I will donate all five cents to a food kitchen or a school.”  Many of you have responded.  The blackberry retains its purity, the food kitchen and school benefit.  The friendship is unsullied.  And it doesn’t give me ’the Willies.''\r\n\r\nThis notion of plucking berries together is no fiction.  We’re all out there, side by side, in front of a bramble of blackberry bushes, both figurative and literal.  All we have to decide is what to do with the opportunities that come to us for free.\r\n\r\nThese weekly emails are meant to offer a refuge where my friends and fans can immerse themselves in aesthetic experience and spiritual purity, altogether removed from the vulgarity, violence, greed and power-lust that imbues so much in contemporary life.\r\n\r\nLike many others, I have found much to admire in the works and beliefs of the American religious sect known as the Shakers.  I think they were onto this notion I’ve tried to explain above and to exemplify in my life choices.  \r\n\r\nMind you, the Shakers were in business; they were farmers, craftspeople, merchants.  Like all of us, they had to keep themselves warm, dry and fed.  But the acquisition of money and power for its own sake was never their aim.  Dealing in currency, a medium of exchange, was merely a means.  The end they sought and achieved, for a while, was the creation of a refuge, a nourishing environment where aesthetic power and spiritual purity were cultivated and celebrated.\r\n\r\nDid you know that every Shaker was a composer?  The Shakers invented and taught one another a simplified form of musical notation so that if God should send (for free, as always) a tune and words to a Shaker, then that Shaker could stop whatever they were doing and immediately write down the tune and the words before they might be forgotten.  You don’t want to forget a revelation from God, even if it’s just a simple little tune.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, some Shaker tunes are inane; many are wonderful.\r\n\r\nI studied and sang Shaker music when I was young and pressed into service two of the best Shaker tunes in the fifth movement of my Piano Trio #3.\r\n\r\nTo hear The Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) performing that movement with their customary sensitivity, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),73);

I should hardly admire more if real stars fell and lodged on my coat.  Nature is full of genius, full of the divinity; not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand.\r\n	Wheels of the storm-chariots, each of these countless snow-stars comes whirling to earth, pronouncing, with emphasis, the number six.\r\n	What a world we live in! where myriads of these little disks, so beautiful to the most prying eye, are whirled down on every traveller’s coat, the observant and the unobservant, and on the restless squirrel’s fur, and on the far-stretching fields and forests, the wooded dells, the mountain-tops.  \r\n	Far, far away from the haunts of man, they roll down some little slope, ready to swell some little rill.  There they lie, like the wreck of chariot-wheels after a battle in the skies.  Meanwhile the meadow mouse shoves them aside in his gallery, the schoolboy casts them in his snowball, the woodman’s sled glides smoothly over them, these glorious spangles, the sweeping of heaven’s floor.”\r\n\r\n	Thoreau''s lively, leaping, impassioned prose conjoins the humble and the exalted, seeming to say quite all that prose is capable of saying on the subject of snowflakes.\r\n\r\n	Only the conciseness of poetry could best it.

And to the television series.  Not the current one, please no.  The Sherlock series I love is the one produced by the BBC between 1984 and 1994, with the incomparable Jeremy Brett in the title role.  Recently, I’ve been watching that series all over again, in sequence.  \r\n\r\nThis marks my fifth or sixth viewing of the series since those happy days when our kids were infants and we’d get them settled by 8pm on Thursday nights so as to watch the latest episode.  Scrupulously accurate, lovingly made, they delight me as much as ever.  (The Holmes episodes, I mean, not the kids, though they also delight me as much as ever.)\r\n\r\nI mention my enthusiasm for Sherlockiana because the music I want to share with you today strikes me as Holmesian in several respects.  I wonder if you’ll agree?\r\n\r\nIt’s the Waltz from my Convivial Suite for violin and cello, written in 1999, exactly a hundred years, come to think of it, after the era in which the Holmes stories take place.  It’s a suite in seven short movements:\r\n		I. Fugue \r\n		II. Waltz\r\n		III. Blues\r\n		IV. March\r\n		V. Adagio\r\n		VI. Finale\r\n\r\nWe know Sherlock played the violin, and very skillfully, too, but what about Holmes’ friend and colleague, Dr. Watson?  He never claims the ability to play a musical instrument.  But what if he did and just never got round to mentioning it?  Might we imagine Dr. John H. Watson passing a rainy evening playing the cello alongside Sherlock’s violin?  What sort of music would find favor with that convivial duo?\r\n\r\nAnd they are a convivial duo, one of the great convivial duos, right up there with Huck & Jim, Frodo & Sam, Bertie & Jeeves.\r\n\r\nI wrote this convivial "Convivial Suite" for two pairs of friends who enjoy playing the violin and cello together.  One was a pair of Cincinnatians, Christine Nichols (violinist) and Bernice Robinson (cellist).  Bernice suggested the idea and I was toying with it when another cellist friend, Terry King, happened to make the same suggestion, asking for a piece he could could play with his violinist wife, Laura Bossert. \r\n\r\nBecause it was written for friends, I decided to call the piece “Convivial Suite.”  \r\n\r\nThe Waltz movement is the most Sherlockian of the set.  Why?  Because it shares many of the qualities we love in the best of Watson’s (really Doyle’s) accounts of his adventures with Holmes.\r\n\r\nFirst, this little Waltz is cozy.  All the Holmes stories begin in the cozy comfort of that famous apartment at 221B Baker Street.  We’re given delectable bits of information about it;  the Persian slipper on the mantle in which Holmes stores his pipe tobacco, the bullet holes in the wall that spell out “V R” (Victoria Regina), the chemistry set, the gasogene (a Victorian-era device for producing carbonated water), the files of past cases, the newspapers strewn on the floor, the comings and goings of the landlady, Mrs. Hudson, who brings in meals and announces strange visitors.  \r\n\r\nI love to imagine the conversations Mrs. Hudson must have had with her friends.  She must have had friends, though they are never mentioned in the stories.  Good friends, admiring and envious friends, elderly widows like herself, landladies.  She must have held her circle spellbound with accounts of the eccentricities of her famous second-floor tenant and his bizarre, outlandish clients.  \r\n\r\nWe are made to feel all the cozier by the reminders of the weather, which is usually foul; there is rain and fog and the splash and clop of hooves resounds on the wet pavements but a few feet away.  Still, in this apartment, we are warm, dry, well fed and safe.  I say “we” because Doyle contrives to give us the feeling that we are present, that there are three of us there:  Holmes, Watson and you, we, us, the gentle Reader.  \r\n\r\nThen arrives a visitor with a curious tale and a problem.  Evil is a-stir and malevolent doings demand a close investigation.  We are off!  As Holmes says, quoting Shakespeare, "The game is afoot!”\r\n\r\nCozy as the music is, I think you’ll find that there is something a little odd about it, too.  A certain savor of the exotic and sinister.  The tales are replete with the exotic and the sinister.  Curious weapons, secret poisons, arcane codes.  Outlandish animals, too.  A mongoose, a  killer orangutan.  The Speckled Band turns out to be a venomous snake, native to India, who, we are told, feeds on milk and can be trained to respond to the low whistle of its master.  Then there is the chilling reference to the Giant Rat of Sumatra, the ghastly account of which is never explicated because, we are told, “the world is not yet prepared.”  One wonders what preparations must be undertaken by the world before Doyle deems it ready, at last, for this story to be told.\r\n\r\nThe music?  Well, listen and see if you don’t hear something suggestive of the vast world that lies “out there," far removed from the calm. orderly, habitable handful of acres where our daily lives are lived, our steady habits prevail, where we contentedly earn and munch upon our quotidian bread.\r\n\r\nOh, reading those stories, we catch a glimpse of how very much more there is in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in our philosophy.\r\n\r\nMystery and suspense are always at the core of the doings of Watson and Holmes.  Holmes grasps what is happening far more quickly than Watson, of whom Holmes says, “You see, Watson, but you do not observe!”  All we have to go on is what Watson tells us.  He sees well enough but, we feel, he sees no more than we would see, should we be so fortunate as he, accompanying Holmes on his adventures.  No fool, Watson.  A good, stout, dependable man, a brave and loyal friend.  Neither he nor we can hope to be as brilliant as Holmes but we can do our best to live up to the example Watson sets for us; we can strive to emulate his sturdy qualities.\r\n\r\nWell, there is an air of mystery about this music.  Suspense, even.  A little.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each story, as with the coda of a well-crafted piece of music, comes closure.  The mystery is explained and solved;  Holmes methods are revealed.  Justice is served.  \r\n\r\nWe demand that fiction ends with a sense of closure and we demand no less of music.  When the music stops, we must feel that the expression is complete, that the ideas presented at the beginning have been sufficiently developed and explored, that a decisive and final conclusion has been reached, that nothing remains to be said.  \r\n\r\nAchieving closure in music is a tricky business; I am at a loss to say how it is done.  I could not advise a young composer on how to fashion a sense of closure at the end of a piece of music.  All I can say is that I know it when I hear it.  Instinct, I suppose, for want of a better word, is what enables a composer to know just when and how to end a piece….  \r\n\r\n	… and just when and how to end a little email essay like this one.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Laura Bossert and cellist Terry King playing the Waltz from my Convivial Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 30, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 1, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello everybody -- \r\n\r\nAs I write this, I''m imagining all of you sitting here with me in our little living room.  It''s a heart warming thought, but of course you''d never fit.  Reminds me of the old joke:\r\n\r\n"Will you join me in a cup of tea?"\r\n\r\n"We''d never fit!"\r\n\r\nha.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of jokes, today I''m inviting you to listen to violinist Laurie Bossert and cellist Terry King playing the "March" movement from a suite I wrote specifically for them, entitled "Convivial Suite."\r\n\r\nI''m going for humor here.  It''s intended to be funny.  Not laugh-out-loud, slap-your-knee, bend-over funny.  Just a short piece that warrants a short chuckle.\r\n\r\nTime was, humor was a regular feature of concert music.  Haydn''s works are full of funny touches.  But as Romanticism climaxed in the 19th century and current events grew so overwhelmingly grim in the 20th century, humor as a device in ''serious'' music was abandoned.\r\n\r\nOh, here and there you find some ironic humor in Prokofiev, bitter humor in Shostakovich, broad American humor in Charles Ives.  But that''s about it.\r\n\r\nThen comes Peter Schickele, a.k.a. PDQ Bach, a composer who has made humor his centerpiece.   I make no bones about it:  Schickele is my favorite living American composer.  The man''s a genius, albeit a comic genius.\r\n\r\nThis March for violin and cello isn''t nearly as funny as Schickele''s best stuff, but it prompts a chuckle.  The Convivial Suite features seven movements and six of them are light and funny.  One, the second-to-last, is tragic and deeply felt;  I put it there to contrast with the other movements, to serve as a respite from chuckling.\r\n\r\nMost of the humor in this recording comes from the way the musicians play the music.  All those little glissandi, bows bouncing on strings, the sudden extreme louds and softs, particularly the very last two notes of the piece, the first very loud, the last extremely soft.  Funny!\r\n\r\nThe tunes are original but there''s a section about 3/4 through that always sounds to me like a quotation from "Won''t You Come Home, Bill Bailey?"  -- the part where the words go:  "... with nothin'' but a fine tooth comb."   You might hear this, too.  Or you might not.  Either way it''s a fun piece and requires only 2 minutes, 9 seconds of your time.\r\n\r\nTo hear "March" from "Convivial Suite for violin and cello," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH  \r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHappy Fourth of July weekend.  \r\n\r\nLast week’s email featured philosophy; this week humor is my intent. In any case, now and always, as Prospero says at the end of The Tempest, “my project was to please."\r\n\r\nFour American composers -- Charles Ives, Roy Harris, Samuel Barber and the undersigned --  have something in common (besides being composers who are American.)\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is?  \r\n\r\nGreatness?  \r\n\r\nDon’t make me sigh.  I wish.\r\n\r\nIt’s this:  The spelling of our first and last names are readily discernible.  Hearing our names, even just once, almost any American could spell them correctly.\r\n\r\nIn our time, when millions are agog with googling, it’s handy for a composer to possess a name the correct spelling of which can be readily rendered.\r\n\r\nSay someone hears my music on the radio.  Curious, the listeners, bless their hearts, having experienced the name aurally and but never visually, can crank up a search engine and, in the ‘search'' field, type in what they think they heard:\r\n	\r\n						 s o - w a s h\r\n\r\nBingo!  Bull’s eye!  Pay-dirt!  Eureka!  Voilà!! \r\n\r\nO brave new world that has such gizmos in it.\r\n\r\nYet it all depends upon the listener/searcher being able to spell my name.  Easy!  That’s why it’s good to have a name that’s stupid-simple.  SO-wash.\r\n\r\nStephen Foster came close but people stumbled on the "ph."  He was adamant.  "Stop calling me Steve!” he would shout, pounding the table, making the old ladies jump.  “It''s STEPHEN, I tell you!  NOT STEVE!  STEPHEN!  With a PEE! and an AITCH!"  \r\n\r\nHis friends thought he was kidding.  "Take it easy, Steve," they would say, pouring him another mint julep.  It put him into a mental state which was nameless at the time, but which modern-day nerve specialists have termed ‘the Heebie-jeebies.’ \r\n\r\nAn American listener could go bonkers trying to google the Great Composers’ names if all he had to go by was the pronunciations he was hearing on the local classical music radio station.\r\n\r\nIf you didn’t know the spellings and only heard the names pronounced on the radio, how would YOU attempt to spell the following?\r\n\r\nHidin’ \r\nMoatsart\r\nBaytohvun\r\nShoomun\r\nShowpan\r\nBroms\r\nVahgner\r\nPoocheenee\r\nVairdee\r\nDuhvorzhacque\r\nClawed W.C.  \r\n\r\n(That last one makes me think of the damage a grizzly could wreak a British restroom:  to wit, a badly clawed WC).  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a radio broadcaster, we had fun with composer’s names.  We would deliberately follow a piece of music by Irving Fine with a piece by Vincent D’Indy.  That way, we could say, “Coming up in the next half hour, music by Fine and D’Indy."  (Fine and dandy, get it?)\r\n\r\nSame with Thomas Arne and Karl Orff.  “Coming up:  music by Arne and Orff.”  (On and off.)\r\n\r\nWell, now in my old age …. “as the days dwindle down to a precious few … "\r\n\r\n	(In case you don’t recognize it, that’s a quote from the morose popular ballad “September Song” …  remember?  \r\n\r\n	… then there’s that bit about “the sunburned hands I used to hold.”  What is with that line, by the way?  It makes me imagine her shouting, “Ouch!” and then, "Watch it, you idiot!  Can’t you see that my hands are sunburned?") … \r\n\r\nIt''s a comfort, in my old age, to know that radio listeners can more readily google the names of Ives, Harris, Barber and Sowash than those of almost any other composers.  \r\n\r\nIn that one respect, among composers, we’re tied for first place:  Charlie, Roy, Sam and me.\r\n\r\nFunny.  \r\n\r\nTo hear something funny, take in violinist Laura Bossert and cellist Terry King playing the Finale from my Convivial Suite, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 2, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n98 seconds.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(77,replace(replace('August being a month of rural fairs, consider this anecdote about the grumpy ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes, as told by Izaak Walton in The Compleat Angler:  \r\n\r\n	“Let me tell you, Scholar, that Diogenes walked on a day, with his friend, to see a country fair; where he saw ribbons, and looking-glasses, and nutcrackers, and fiddles, and hobby-horses, and many other gimcracks; and, having observed them, and all the other finimburns that make a complete country-fair, he said to his friend, “Lord, how many things are there in this world of which Diogenes hath no need!”\r\n\r\nIsn’t “finimbrun” a wonderful word?  Walton seems to have invented it.  I like to think of him, quill pen in hand, script paper on the writing desk before him, running his fingers through his hair, rummaging through the fusty corners of his mind, seeking a generic word to summarize the plenitude of sundries, trifles, trinkets, gewgaws and knick-knacks he had envisioned.  Finding no suitable word, he wastes no more time; he makes up a great one on the spot.  "Finimbrun!"  Writers could get away with such things in 1653.  For my money, it''s a mighty fine word, even if it has never achieved widespread usage.  \r\n\r\nWalton’s telling has a charm all its own; his word-strings have a rickety, mock-stately, skimble-shanked, hobble-dehoy rhythm.  You’d think it was a parody of 17th-century prose if you didn’t know that 17th-century prose is precisely what it is.  Delightful to the eye when read, it''s not entirely felicitous for singing.  When I set the anecdote to music I made apologies to Walton’s shade and trimmed the text, thus:\r\n\r\n	“One day Diogenes walked with a friend to a country fair.  And there he saw ribbons and snuff boxes and looking glasses and bird cages and all the other finimbruns which go to make up a country fair.  And he said, “Lord, how many things there are in this world of which Diogenes hath no need.”\r\n\r\nHaving surgically reduced the paragraph to its bones, I fleshed it out again by having the choristers repeat words and phrases.  “Diogenes!” they sing, eight times over, right off the bat, a fanfare to introduce the main character and capture your attention before the anecdote begins.  The repetitions continue throughout, with humorous effect, developing at length into the little fugue that starts on the bottom of page nine.\r\n\r\nA fugue, mind you!  Music doesn''t get more 17th-century than that!  The ultimate flowering of canonic repetition.  \r\n\r\nWhen the last line is reached and we are waiting to hear what the philosopher, afloat in flood of finimbruns, will have to say, the music — appropriately, on the word “Lord,” — suddenly turns solemn, even hymn-like.  We’re expecting an expression of gratitude.  Maybe Diogenes will say something like, “What a piece of work is man, who can devise so fantastic a farrago of, of, of … well, finimbruns!”   \r\n\r\nBut no.  We’re talking about Diogenes after all, the Groucho of his time and place. \r\n\r\n“How many things there are in this world,” he says, "of which Diogenes … hath … no … need!"\r\n\r\nHa, ha!\r\n\r\nMay our lives be free of — or, if we prefer, favored by — finimbruns!\r\n\r\nTo hear the celebrated choral conductor Gregg Smith leading his Gregg Smith Singers in an exuberant rendition of "The Country Fair,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nAugust 2, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),164);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(78,replace(replace('Because I had never heard the sound, I mistook it for the insane barking of a huge pack of wild dogs, surging toward me through the woods.  But the sound approached more rapidly than dogs can run.  Eyes straining, I peered into the underbrush, expecting the first of these high-speed dogs to burst through any second.  Half-panicked, I half-twisted myself around, ready to run at the sight of them.\r\n\r\nThen something overhead caught my eye.  I looked up and saw — for the first time in my life — a flock of Canada Geese flying in V-formation above the hillsides of Bellville, Ohio, where I lived at the time.  I had mistaken their raucous squawking for the sound of berserk barking.  It was 1976 and Canada geese, once nearly extinct, were beginning to rebound.\r\n\r\nIt’s difficult to believe today, but for the first quarter century of my life I never saw Canada geese.  They did not exist in Ohio.  Today, they are found wherever there is water.  They’re so abundant that they present an unsavory problem.  As David Letterman said, “They evacuate but they don’t leave!”\r\n\r\nAll the same, seeing them in flight is a thrill.  The V-formation of geese in flight seems the very essence of The North.  It’s as powerfully suggestive of the vast majesty of this continent as the canoeing song, “Our Paddles Keen and Bright,” which Frank Culp, our Scoutmaster, taught us back in my Boy Scouting days.  He told us the Voyageurs had sung this song as they canoed the endless regions between the Great Lakes and Hudson’s Bay.\r\n\r\nYears later, now an adult volunteer on a High Adventure excursion for older Scouts, I sang that song again, paddle in hand, canoeing the lakes of Ontario’s Algonquin Provincial Park.  I was in the bow and Dick “Grippy” Ferrell, my oldest friend — he was my patrol leader when I joined Scouts in 1961 at the age of 11 — was in the stern.  We sang it loudly as we splashed along by day, we sang it reverently round the campfire by night … \r\n\r\n"Our paddles keen and bright\r\nFlashing like sliver\r\nSwift as the wild goose flight,\r\nDip, dip and swing."\r\n\r\nMy Trio #12 for clarinet, cello and piano is subtitled “Voyageurs:  Homage to Canada.”  The opening movement is entitled “Geese in Flight.”  \r\n\r\nIt begins with a musical depiction of geese flying in V-formation.  The skittery cello and raucous piano energetically declaim an E flat; the cello quickly descends, step-wise, while the piano ascends at the same pace, creating the effect of a widening V-shape.\r\n\r\nThen comes “Our Paddles Keen and Bright,” played in the lowest register of the cello, as if the song is rising from the pure, cold depths of Algonquin''s lakes.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet enters with the first three notes of Max Steiner''s main theme from “How the West Was Won,” a motif that, for me, still resonates with heroism and spaciousness.\r\n\r\nThese three musical figures — the V-shape, “Our Paddles” and Steiner''s three-note motif — are developed as the movement unfolds, made into little fugues, expanded, overlapped.  \r\n\r\nThe V-shape is heard four times.  The last time, at the end of the movement, it is played in reverse, the outer notes converging, narrowing until they reach the same E flat that began the movement, to suggest the flock disappearing in the distance. \r\n\r\nThis music has never been professionally recorded;  very few have heard it.

I tried to make each of them beautiful in their own way, but BEAUTY, as such, was rarely the Thing I was trying to achieve.  Only three or four were written with BEAUTY as the sole intent.\r\n\r\nOne of these is linked to this message (see below) and I hope you''ll listen to all 5 minutes and 16 seconds of it.  It is very nearly the most beautiful music I''ve written, yet it has been performed only twice and never professionally recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is "Starshadows on Snow," the third movement of my Trio #12 for clarinet, cello and piano, written in 2003, subtitled "Voyageurs:  Homage to Canada."\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the entire work, here are the titles of all four movements:\r\nI.  Geese in Flight\r\nII.  Song of the Voyageurs\r\nIII.  Starshadows on Snow\r\nIV.  A Majestic Land\r\n\r\nThe third movement depicts a boreal forest on a still, clear, moonless night, the starlight sifting faintly through bare, black branches, casting delicate, blue-gray shadows on the twinkling snow.\r\n\r\nThe cello opens the movement with a tentative, rising figure; the figure ascends to the clarinet and ascends from there to those tinkling keys in the highest register of the piano.  Listen for the star music there, a gentle, poignant, descending pattern.  \r\n\r\nThis music always brings to mind one of Shakespeare''s most beautiful lines:  \r\n\r\n		"Look how the floor of Heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold!"  \r\n\r\nThen comes the tune, played by the cello.  It begins with an octave leap upward, as when we turn our faces starward, then slowly, softly drifts down, like starlight blanketing a winterscape.  Four times the tune is heard, each with a different texture and treatment, the last a hymn of thanksgiving.  The piano, again in its highest register, whispers the final measures.  It''s very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere is a minor challenge awaiting you, I regret to say.  Unlike the other mp3s I''ve shared with you in recent weeks, this is not a professional recording.  It was performed by pretty good amateur musicians in a church but recorded with only just adequate sound equipment.  Please try to hear past the technical quality; it is rough in places and never great.  Hearing past the technical quality is a skill unto itself, like perceiving what is good about a play despite the flaws of a particular production or savoring what is good in a novel despite a scattering of aggravating typos.\r\n\r\nI''ve produced fifteen CDs of my music over the past 24 years but many fine pieces, like this one, have not yet been professionally recorded.  Most likely, this will be the only opportunity you''ll ever have to hear this beautiful music.\r\n\r\nClick on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nDecember, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI’m sometimes undone by the combination of solitude and the setting sun.  \r\n\r\nCamping alone, driving solo through a dreary November twilight, even sitting in our livingroom while Jo is out on an evening errand, I’ve been overtaken by melancholy, overpowered by nostalgia, overwhelmed by wistfulness.\r\n\r\nI''d have been a miserable voyageur.   \r\n\r\nYou know about the voyageurs?  Intrepid French Canadian canoers, their quest for furs drove them to the remotest regions of our continent.\r\n\r\nI admire those ‘mountain men’ and proudly sport my red voyageur’s ‘toque’ (stocking cap) and ‘ceinture flèschée” (woven ''arrowed’ scarf / sash), Christmas gifts from my dear wife, apt ornaments for me, a North American man of French ancestry.  \r\n\r\nThat’s me!  C’est moi!  (I’m not French Canadian, but only because my French ancestors stepped off the gangplank in Boston instead of Quebec.)\r\n\r\nVoyageurs, deep in the wild, drew what comfort they could from their pipes, their Hudson’s Bay blankets and their music.  A voyageur who could fiddle was highly respected, even prized, by his peers.  Their music is what you would expect:  cheerful, bumptious, hearty, repetitious.\r\n\r\nOddly, the music I wrote to honor the voyageurs embodies none of those traits.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of the title — "Night Song of the Voyageurs" — my homage has nothing to do with their music.  If a canoeful of voyageurs, shooting the Rapids of Time, were to arrive at our present day, and catch an earful of the music I want to share today, they would exchange bewildered looks.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that this movement — the second of my four-movement Trio #12 “Voyageurs:  Homage to Canada” —  is not about the voyageurs at all. \r\n\r\nIt’s about the feelings I know I would have if I were a solitary voyageur, far from my loved ones, wrestling with melancholy as the daylight fades and night comes on.\r\n\r\nSince my earliest Boy Scout days, I’ve felt a little ashamed of these bouts of crepuscular dejection.  Nowadays I simply admit it to myself.  With age comes self-acceptance.  I try to structure my life so as to avoid the dusk-y doldrums.  If all else fails, I phone my daughter or son for a cheery chat. \r\n\r\nNow that you know the truth about this music, enter it.  Let me be your guide.  If you want to listen while you read the following, copy and paste this link into your browser:\r\n\r\n		http://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/trio_12_2.mp3\r\n\r\nMy “Night Song of the Voyageurs" opens with a long, lonely cello solo playing a  tune that is both sad and lovely.\r\n\r\nAt 1:47 the cello ventures a cadenza, inviting the clarinet to take up the tune.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet obliges at 2:09, while the cello retreats to a supportive contrapuntal line in the lower octave. \r\n\r\nSuch a beautiful sound, the combination of clarinet and cello, with all the richness and depth of Canadian Grade A maple syrup.\r\n\r\nAt 4:15 it’s the clarinet’s turn to venture a cadenza, inviting the piano, which has rested silent thus far.\r\n\r\nAt 4:42 the pianist takes a turn as a soloist and, in a new and unexpected key, intones a variant of the sad and lovely tune, very high on the keyboard, with a tinkling left-hand accompaniment that evokes the stars and the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nFor me, this music recalls Shakespeare''s beautiful line,   \r\n\r\n	"Look how the floor of Heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold!”  \r\n\r\nAt 6:30 the cello returns, as does the clarinet at 6:50 while the piano retreats, supporting their duet only with long sustained chords and a few flourishes, a few faint brush strokes.\r\n\r\nAt 8:33 all three instruments play as equals for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis is some of my most expressive music.  Gloomy, yet gleaming.  Sorrowful yet sparkling.\r\n\r\nEven the darkest night ends at last.  At 9:30 the piano heralds coming of dawn; at 9:49 the sun rises.\r\n\r\nBut it’s a false dawn;  heavy clouds quickly set in.  The movement ends with the cello plucking three grim chords on just two strings, loud and harsh.\r\n\r\nThis music has never been professionally recorded;  very few have heard it.  I would like to feature it on a CD someday, along with my Trios #11 and #13, also as yet unrecorded.  \r\n\r\nFor now, that’s just a dream, like the pipe dream of a voyageur, alone by his campfire, warmed by his Hudson’s Bay blanket, gazing at the night sky.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the second movement of Trio #12,” entitled “Night Song of the Voyageurs,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve is a monumental number.

Shall eggs be left unsung, unremembered, uncelebrated?  "Shall there be no more cakes and ale?"  Eggs are things of importance!  You can’t make an omelet without them.  Most commonly, eggs manifest themselves in twelves, dozens.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished my Trio #11 for clarinet, cello and piano, I knew that if I wrote another trio, being numbered “12," it would have to be monumental, epic, vast, bold and strong!\r\n\r\n(Similarly, I took it as a given that if I were to write a Trio #13 it would have to be dark, intense and turbulent.  And it so it turned out to be!  But that is another story and shall be told at another time.)\r\n\r\nWhat topic, then, would befit my mandatorily monumental Trio #12?\r\n\r\nCanada!  I would write a four-movement homage to our great northern neighbor,  the final movement being an evocation of the impressions the landscapes had made upon us during our visits to British Columbia, the Canadian Rockies, Algonquin Provincial Park, Montréal, Québec City, the Isle D’Orléans and up the St. Lawrence to Charlevoix, truly the gateway of North America.  \r\n\r\nWith these breathtaking places in mind, I dubbed the final movement of my Trio #12, “A Majestic Land.”\r\n\r\nThe number twelve arrogated a work in four movements, scored in three flats (the key of E flat major), scored for three instruments.  4 x 3 = 12.   \r\n\r\nThe piano''s 88 keys endow that instrument with a range extending far below the lowest note of the cello, far above the highest note of the clarinet.  Of those three instruments, the piano can make the biggest sound.  \r\n\r\nIn my eleven preceding trios I had conceived of the clarinet and the cello as the leading characters, co-stars in the musical narratives, the piano mostly consigned to providing the backdrop, the set, the landscape where a "clarinet-meets-cello" story unfolded.  Now, as the number twelve and the immensity of Canada''s landscapes shaped my thinking, the piano became the protagonist.\r\n\r\nIn effect, this work is not a trio or even a chamber work; rather, it is a concerto for piano and orchestra except that the orchestra consists of only two instruments:  a clarinet and a cello.  In the scoring, I dispatched those two instruments to play with a philharmonic fullness and sweep; the greatness of an orchestra was thrust upon ‘em.\r\n\r\nUnique among my works, this trio draws on the achievements of the Finnish composer, Jean Sibelius, perhaps, among the composers our culture has deemed ‘great,’  the one whom I most admire.  In particular, the trio takes inspiration from Sibelius'' 5th Symphony, also in E flat major.\r\n\r\nI associate the Finnish Sibelius with Canada because he is “of the North.”  As a Finn, his music stands in relation to the music of continental Europe in somewhat the same way that Canada stands in relation to the USA.  Aloof from the obsessive motivic development of the Austrians, the Impressionist reveries of the French, the nationalism and exoticism of the Russians, the bucolic  pensiveness of the British, Sibelius evokes the harsh beauty of Nature.  His music seems to grow out of itself, just as a fern or a fox, a stream or a storm, a glacier or a mountain grow out of themselves.  \r\n\r\nAs an American attempting to fashion an homage to Canada, a stylistic homage to Sibelius seemed apt. \r\n\r\nAll the same, my Trio #12 is a work of chamber music.  The greatest Sibelius works — his symphonies and tone poems — are orchestral.  My Trio #12 presses the bounndaries of chamber music, striving to be larger in scope than a work of chamber music can be.  \r\n\r\nIt offers a challenge and raises a question:  how epic? — how strong? — how bold and vast? — can a work of chamber music be?  I pushed that frontier as far as I could.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to have scored this music for piano and orchestra.  But if I had written a piano concerto, you would never hear it.  No pianist and orchestra would ever play it unless I hired them and though I have spent a small fortune producing my CDs, I could never afford to hire a soloist, a conductor, sixty musicians, a sound crew and a concert hall to record a piano concerto.\r\n\r\nThe musicians you’ll soon hear playing “A Majestic Land" received no payment for their efforts.  As has been the case with most of the musicians on my recordings, their motivation to rehearse the music and record this music was love.  My gratitude, and yours, would be their only compensation.  They worked very hard to master it, gave a single performance, sent me the recording.  \r\n\r\nExcept for the small audience that attended that performance, you are the first to hear this music!  That’s exciting, don’t you think?\r\n\r\nI hope someday to issue the entire Trio #12 on a CD along with my other two as-yet-unrecorded trios for clarinet, cello and piano:  Trio #11 “We Sang, We Danced,” and Trio #13 “Passacaglia & Fugue.”  The chances are slim.  CDs are awfully expensive to produce; composing is an expensive hobby!  \r\n\r\nI want to find ways to share my work but, as many of you know, with age comes parsimony; we are more inclined to conserve our resources, less inclined to expend them; we don’t know what lies ahead; the only certainty is the imminent dwindling of our resources and energy.  \r\n\r\nHappily, these days, music doesn’t HAVE to be on a CD to be heard.  It can simply be sent to friends and fans, as I am doing in these emails, with links to websites where mp3s await your discovery.\r\n\r\nToday, to hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the last movement of Trio #12,” entitled “A Majestic Land,” click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil we moved to 6836 School Street last January, I never realized how much a right-feeling home can boost one’s particular quotient of Gross Personal Happiness.  The months we have passed here since January have been the happiest I’ve known since “I came to man’s estate.”\r\n\r\nHere, in the semi-countryside between Newtown and Mariemont, “Quietness keeps her dwelling and Peace descends like snow.”  \r\n\r\nThe house is smallish but spacious-seeming; the exterior has the clean, Greek Revival lines in the pure Federalist style; the interior is graced with gleaming hardwood floors, built-in cabinets, amber-toned paneling, exposed beams, a window-seat and three brick-and-stone fireplaces.  \r\n\r\nCome 2030, with luck and/or the Grace of God, we will be on hand to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the construction of “The Garard-Martin House.”   That is the historically accurate, albeit lackluster name of the house as designated on the metal plaque out front, indicating its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.\r\n\r\nOld houses often have names.  Our ‘new’ house reminds us very strongly of Forge Brook Farm, which is not a farm but rather the name of the 1760 home of our friends in West Cornwall, CT.  We have, with great delight, house-sat for them many times while they were traveling, for stretches of three to eight weeks.  Exploring Litchfield County, we discovered that many of northwestern Connecticut''s country estates have names:  Stonehaven, Cream Hill, Roseland, Greenlea, Brookside.\r\n\r\nBefore the Hand of God led us to 6836 School Street, Cincinnati, OH, we sometimes fantasized about moving to Litchfield County, CT.  We amused ourselves by trying to decide what name we would give to our property there.\r\n\r\n“Puttin’ on the Grits” was Jo’s brilliant suggestion.  None of the other names we  considered topped that one for sheer wit.  What a woman, stringing together those four words, clustering all those associations into a single phrase, mingling the accurate and the ironic, the literal and the metaphorical.  My wife!  I am in awe of her.\r\n\r\nStill, that name wouldn’t apply to our home here on School Street.  Truth be told, ours is a modest neighborhood.  None of our neighbors could be justly satirized for ostentatiously “Puttin’ on the Ritz.” \r\n\r\nShould we re-name our home?  On line, I found a house-naming website mounted by a sign-making company.  The site’s headline admonishes the visitor with sombre words of warning:  “Naming your home is an important reflection of yourself so choosing the perfect name is an important and difficult job.”\r\n\r\nGranted.  Duly noted.  When the word ‘important’ appears twice in the same sentence, someone really means business.\r\n\r\nI set to work, trying to employ the hopeful tips offered on the site..\r\n\r\nThe site asked, “What plants and animals are found near your house?”\r\n\r\nPoison ivy is a-flourish here, wherever the lawn meets the woods.  I chop it up with a hoe, roots and all, as soon as I spot it.  I have pledged to fight it for as long as I live here.\r\n\r\nCanada geese fly in and evacuate abundantly in these parts.  You have to watch where you step.  “Wild Goose Chase” seems an authentic name for the house, indigenously derived.  But is it?  Most of the geese just fly overhead; they don’t actually live here.\r\n\r\nSquirrels and moles, on the other hand, are so profuse that a passerby might conclude that we are operating a sanctuary for these little furry creatures.  “Squirrel Sanctum” would be an apt name except that it suggests that we provide hospice care, mortuary rituals plus interment or cremation for these agile ‘tree rats.’  We do not.  We do, however, lavish upon them a great deal of bird seed, purchased at a considerable cost.  \r\n\r\nIn “The Wind in the Willows” the character “Mole” calls his home “Mole End.”  That brings to mind other literary house-names:  “Howard’s End,” “Bag End” and elfin names like “Journey’s End,” “Vagabond’s Rest” and “Wanderer’s Repose.”  Please.\r\n\r\n“Sowash End” conjures discomfiting images.  What “end” (or whose) are we being asked to cleanse?   The same would hold true for other potential but vaguely unsavory names such as “Raw End” or “Butt End.”  \r\n\r\n“Which End?” or “To What End?” come to mind but unless there is some uncertainty about the title-deed one doesn’t want a question mark at the end of a house name. \r\n\r\n“Happy Ending”?  Uh, no.  It’s too fey, too close akin to saccharine house names like Dunroamin, Welcombe Hombe and The Crofties.\r\n\r\nOur handyman says we are living in “Baby Monticello.”  What would that be in Italian?  “Monticellini?”  Sounds like Mussolini’s favorite pasta.  Won’t do.  \r\n\r\nSymmetrically posted on our front porch pillars are two flags:  that of France and that of the good ole U.S. of A.  “Two Flags Over Sowash” comes to mind but it’s too close to “Six Flags Over Texas.”  \r\n\r\n“Peace of Mind” has some appeal but it’s too close to giving someone “A Piece of My Mind.”\r\n\r\nWe recently put a new roof on the house -- Hunter Green shingles that match the shutters and flower boxes.  Remembering “Anne of Green Gables,” perhaps the house should be named “Green Shingles.”  Jo could pass herself off as “Jo of Green Shingles.”  But there’s an echo of disease there; it brings to mind an attack of the varicella-zoster virus that has manifested itself, for some arcane reason, with a painful skin rash that is green instead of the customary pink.  Shingles, as experienced by The Incredible Hulk (who is all-green) or anyone else, is / are no joke.\r\n\r\nThen again, seeing as how Jo and I, in Ovid’s felicitous phrase, "form a multitude,” maybe our house name should arise from our having remained a couple for nearly half a century.  \r\n\r\nWe are a happy duo, all told, but the combination of our given names is not.  “Rickjo” sounds like a mispronunciation of “rickshaw” and “Jorick” evokes Hamlet pondering the skull of that “fellow of infinite jest,” the court jester he remembers from his boyhood.  Drivers-by, seeing the sign out front, would burst out with, “Alas, poor Jorick, I knew him, Horatio.”\r\n\r\n“The Gruesome Twosome” would be fun during the Halloween season but a dud and a downer during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nBeyond our names and the fact of our couple-hood, how might we be described?  What word or phrase summarizes the character of our long mutual adventure?\r\n\r\nJo’s term -- “Independently Foolish” -- nails it and might almost serve as a house name.  \r\n\r\nOr my term, simply:  “Harrumph.”\r\n\r\nJust kidding.  Both come close, but neither warrants a cigar as house names go.\r\n\r\nSetting aside the current occupants (us), what word describes this place?  It’s a house, nothing more.  But ‘house’ is disappointing, a flat and boring word.  Some combination of squirrels or poison ivy with a coy synonym for ‘house’ (such as chalet, shanty, bungalow, cottage, lodge, hall or ‘My Blue Heaven’) might work for some.  Not us.  ‘House’ may be boring; at least it’s not pretentious.\r\n\r\nStill, if we use the word ‘house,’ then “The House of Sowash” comes too close to “The House of Usher,” which is to be avoided for its dark associations.\r\n\r\n“The House of Something or Other” seems pleasantly whimsical to me but Jo is not amused.\r\n\r\nMight the word “house” have distant cousins that could serve?\r\n\r\n“Sowashes’ Keep.”  (Sowashes keepers, losers weepers, right?)\r\n\r\n“Sowashes’ Roost.”  (What are we, chickens?)\r\n\r\n“Sowash Knob.”  (A chore for the cleaning lady.)\r\n\r\n“Sowash Rise.”  (Sounds like Proctor & Gamble’s newest laundry detergent.)\r\n\r\n“Sowashstead” is as close to the name of an English manor house as we’re likely to come.  Alas, we are neither English nor “to the manor born.”\r\n\r\nSince 6836 School Street is, for us, our ‘new’ house, how about “Sowash New”?  Nope.  Bad pun.\r\n\r\nErroll Flynn would approve, I think, of “Sowashbuckler’s Retreat” but even the cleverest puns leave me a little nauseous.\r\n\r\nStill, I think I could make an exception for a punning house name that picks up on my French heritage and the on-going comic entertainment of which my life is largely comprised:  “Cirque de Sowash.”\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to admit it is a nimble name for a house.  It might just do.\r\n\r\nNow if only I can convince Jo.\r\n\r\n                                                           * * *\r\nNaming a house is easy compared to naming certain pieces of music.\r\n\r\nSettling on a suitable title can sometimes be the most difficult part of composing.  The tunes tumble out, but how shall we "name the baby”?  Of my 400+ works, the title over which I struggled most was “Starshadows on Snow” from my trio #12 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Homage to Canada.”  \r\n\r\nOne wouldn’t think it would be so difficult to name the phenomenon of starlight glaring faintly behind  bare tree limbs to create stark, indigo-blue silhouettes on twinkling, silvery snow.  To compress all of that into three words was, with me, the work of a month or more.  “Starshadows on Snow” was the best I could do.  Even now I’m not completely satisfied with it.  At a certain point, you just have to let it go.  \r\n\r\nA clever title can’t save weak music; beautiful music is rendered no less beautiful by a merely adequate title.\r\n\r\nThe title “Starshadows on Snow" will serve and the music is gorgeous, if I’m allowed to say so.  It’s one of my prettiest pieces.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Starshadows on Snow” from my Trio #12 for Clarinet, Cello & Piano, “Homage to Canada,”  played by the Trio da Camera ((clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nRead Yo-Yo Ma’s explanation of what music does for us, part of an interview with David Marchese published in the NYTimes on Nov. 20, 2020:\r\n\r\n	“What the pandemic has crystallized in my mind is that we need music because it helps us to get to very specific states of mind.  … Everybody wants to get to certain states of mind during the day, during the cycle of the seasons.  And during a pandemic, with the alienation of not having social contact, music is the energy [for that]. … We need music to make us feel at equilibrium through hard times and good times.”\r\n\r\nI love how he puts it:  music takes us to certain very specific states of mind.  \r\n\r\nWhen I have an hour of cooking ahead of me, or a half-hour of dishwashing after supper, I often listen, while I’m working, to music that brings me to certain states of mind.  The adagio of Rachmaninoff’s Symphony #2.  Gerald Finzi’s Eclogue and the Andante Quieto movement from his cello concerto.  Richard Rodney Bennett’s suite from the film “Enchanted April.”  The slow movement of Ravel’s piano concerto.\r\n\r\nI don’t listen to my own music at such times; it is too distracting.  My own music takes me to states of mind in which I recall the setting where I wrote the music, the issues in my life at that time, the people I knew and hoped to touch back then, many of whom are gone now.  It’s too much to deal with when one is sautèe-ing minced shallots in olive oil, tossing in a pinch of this, a dash of that and a tablespoon of what-have-you.\r\n\r\nMusic prompts a state of mind, yes, but the reverse is also true; a state of mind can prompt music.  A tune can sometimes emerge from and express a very specific state of mind.  I recall one such tune; it came to me at just this time of year, when autumn gives way to winter.  It came to me in G minor, a very particular and key, peculiar in that it is the brightest of the minor keys and has both sharps and flats.  \r\n\r\nThe tune seemed to call out:  “Sing me!  SING me!  I must be SUNG!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, OK, gladly,” I replied to the tune.  “But you have no lyrics.”  \r\n\r\n“You must invent them,” said the tune.\r\n\r\n“Me?  I’m a writer of sorts, but not a poet.  Oh, I wrote a few poems when I was a college student but they weren’t good.  Just thinking about them now embarrasses me.”\r\n\r\nThe tune wouldn’t take no for an answer.  “Invent the lyrics,” it repeated.  “If you don’t, who will?  No one.  Sadly, I shall forever remain a song without words.”\r\n\r\nA week or two after this curious conversation, I had to make the tedious five-hour drive, solo, from Cincinnati to Cleveland.  The landscape is almost featureless between those two cities.  Remember, it was early December.  Rural Ohio at its bleakest.\r\n\r\nI get through long drives by listening to NPR or classical music radio stations.  This time, I did something else.  I brought along a clipboard, paper and a pencil.  I resolved not to turn on the radio until I had invented the lyrics for this G minor tune.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had to find my way back to the “very specific state of mind” from which the tune had emerged.  The bleak landscape helped, as did the key of G minor.  I set my cruise control for 72 mph, and despite tail-gating semi-trucks, sociopaths roaring past at 100 mph and the crass enticements of billboards, I jotted words as they came to me.  \r\n\r\nI scratched out some, tried again, singing the while, casting about for rhymes and words with round, singable vowels, writing “blind” because my eyes were on the road ahead of me.  It was difficult both physically and mentally, but intriguing, like solving a puzzle.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the outskirts of Cleveland, the task was completed.\r\n\r\nThat was the only time I have written lyrics for one of my own tunes.  It required a certain kind of self-discipline and focus to which I have not returned.  \r\n\r\nThe poem that sprang from my efforts is respectable.  Not great, but not bad either, in my opinion.  Judge for yourself:\r\n\r\nNow gone are the autumn leaves, \r\nto cold earth they have fled, \r\nand all of the trees seem dreary now \r\nthat once were yellow and red. \r\n\r\nNow over us cold winds are blowing, \r\nmourning the passing of fall, \r\nreminding us of the truth immutable: \r\ndeath comes to us all. \r\n\r\nSuch words we cannot gainsay. \r\nThis truth to all is known, \r\nand we feel it most keenly this time of year, \r\nwhen autumn colors have flown.  \r\n\r\nYet look again at field and forest, \r\nstudy the stubble and twig: \r\na hint of color foretells a blossom \r\nwill bloom forth from each sprig. \r\n\r\nSo friends, let us gather now \r\nand sing Life''s Oldest Song, \r\nreminding ourselves to love that well \r\nwhich we must leave ere long, \r\n\r\nConsoling one another''s sorrows, \r\nraising our voices high \r\nand living life more fully knowing \r\nthat, like leaves, we must fly.\r\n\r\nI scored the music for SATB chorus and piano.  Chris Miller led our church choir’s rendition of the piece as an anthem in an Advent service at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian.\r\n\r\nLater I rescored the tune, wordless, for clarinet, cello and piano, expanding it considerably into the slow movement of my Trio #12 for those instruments, titled “Night Song of the Voyageurs.” \r\n\r\nMy chamber works have often first seen the light of day as a song, later  expanded into an instrumental work.  That much of my chamber music can be described as “lyrica” is not surprising that considering that many of the tunes began as vocal works, i.e., works with words.  \r\n\r\nThus, music and lyrics can both arise from and evoke what Yo-Yo Ma calls “a very specific state of mind.”  And when that is music played, listeners are drawn into the very state of mind in which the composer discovered the tune and invented, at least in this one case, for me, the lyrics.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the second movement of Trio #12,” entitled “Night Song of the Voyageurs,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),89);

Let me try to explain it.\r\n\r\nTonal music has a tonal center, a home-base note;  pieces end on that note, making listeners feel they''ve arrived home safely at the end of a piece.  It''s the note at the end that says, "Closure."  Music theorists call this note "the tonic."  \r\n\r\nThe tonic has a certain feel to it, a musical metaphor expressing centered-ness.  \r\n\r\nIn this piece, the third note you''ll hear is the tonic, sung on the word "still."  The words go "Be still," the tune starting beneath the tonic on the word "Be" and then rising up to the tonic on the word "still."  Next the words go, again, "Be still," only this time the tune begins above the tonic on the word "Be" and then settles down to the tonic, arriving, again, on the word "still."\r\n\r\nThe third phrase of the piece starts once again beneath the tonic on the word "Be," rises to the tonic and then soars to notes higher than we''ve heard so far.\r\n\r\nSee the metaphor?  "Stillness," the music is saying, is found on the tonic.  The tonic is where the stillness is, musically, just as God is where the stillness is, theologically.  And with stillness, the music says as it soars, comes the assurance that God is God, that we don''t need to worry or fear, that the universe is not in our control and that is as it should be.\r\n\r\nThis is a comforting thought.  The piece calms me, too.  When I am stuck in traffic or standing stock-still in a long line at the post office, bank or grocery, I softly sing this piece to myself, over and over, until things start to move.  It works!\r\n\r\nYou''ll hear the tune three times (three = Trinity).  First, in unison.  Then in canon (half the choir sings the tune a few notes behind the other half).  And finally in four-part harmony.

Auburn Presbyterian Church, I’ve written about 20 anthems for the choir and 15 hymns for the congregation.  None of them pertain to “the African-American experience.”\r\n\r\n	In some of my works, I have adopted musical elements invented by American-Americans:  ragtime, jazz, polyrhythms and the Blues scale.  My seven-movement “Calloway Suite” for clarinet and cello pays tribute to the great Cab Calloway.  The suite is one white composer’s earnest attempt to honor and build upon African-Americans’ contributions to music.   The piece has never been recorded, alas (clarinetists and cellists, please see the P.S. below), so I cannot share it with you.  The titles of the movements convey an idea of the piece: \r\n	1. Clean Up \r\n	2. Can’t Help I’m Feelin’ So Blue \r\n	3. Sun Yourself \r\n	4. Weary Song \r\n	5. Beignets & Gelato \r\n	6, Ah Got Kin \r\n	7.

How could I, white-as-the-day-is-long, explore that experience?  What do I know about it?  Nothing.  My Calloway Suite is the music of a white guy observing African-American musical culture from inside his bubble of privilege.  How could it be otherwise?\r\n\r\n	And yet … other white artists have observed the African-American experience and been inspired to create “Porgy and Bess,” “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” which revealed the horrors of slavery.\r\n\r\n	One of the many moving sections of Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself” begins, thus:\r\n\r\n	The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\r\n	I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\r\n	Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\r\n	And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\r\n	And brought water and fill''d a tub for his sweated body and bruis''d feet ...\r\n\r\n	Yet those powerful verses are not directly about the African-American experience.  Rather, they express the authentic experience of white Americans observing, with great empathy, from within their respective bubble.  Is that not a good thing?\r\n\r\n	Our intense discourse about George Floyd’s death and, by extension, our nation’s racial inequality and the seeming impunity of armed white male power has led millions of white and black citizens to do more than observe.  Much more.  Ironically, Mr. Floyd’s death prompted hundreds of thousands of Americans to come alive and express themselves.\r\n\r\n	Which brings me to the one piece of mine which may address, in the  limited way of a white composer, something authentic about the experience of Arimel and all African-Americans.  It’s a choral setting of these transcendent words by the great African-American author, theologian and civil rights activist Howard Thurman:\r\n\r\n	“Don’t ask what the world needs.\r\n	Ask what makes you come alive and go do it.\r\n	Because what the world needs are people who have come alive.”\r\n\r\n	These words transcend racism and the differing life experiences of segments of humanity.  They are addressed to each of us, whatever our condition, yet they speak of the needs of ‘the world.’  They push us to a larger view, as do the utterances of M.L. King, Dr. Thurman’s associate.\r\n\r\n	Those who are protesting have come alive and are acting accordingly.  So are those of us who, unable to protest physically with our presence in the streets, bless them and pray for them and communicate our thoughts and feelings to our elected officials.\r\n\r\n	Many, many Americans are suddenly becoming the “alive people” Dr. Thurman said the world needs.  Though he penned his admonition before the word “woke,” meaning alert to injustice, came into use, he was aiming toward that notion.\r\n\r\n	When you listen my setting of those words, notice the African-American influences, a touch of the Blues scale, some dense jazz harmonies and modulations, a bit of syncopation in the way the words are sung, the polyrhythms Louis Armstrong explored.    \r\n\r\n	Not that this music SOUNDS African-American.  It doesn’t.  It can’t.  It is simply one white composer’s attempt to honor, incorporate and extend a few elements of the musical vocabulary which our African-American brothers and sisters have bestowed upon us.\r\n\r\n	I have a hunch that Arimel, if she had heard this music, might have nodded, smiled and approved.\r\n\r\n	This recording is not on any CD.

The parts are professional in appearance, easy to read.  The page-turns are workable!  Yes!\r\n\r\nEach movement is two or three minutes long.\r\n\r\nWhen I say “willing to record,” I do NOT mean entering a professional recording studio.  All I’m asking is that two good musicians set up their music stands in their living room, push the ‘record’ button on a cell phone and start playing.  It should be fun!\r\n\r\nThen, send me the recording and I’ll share it in upcoming ‘mpFrees’ with friends and fans.\r\n\r\nAlmost all my instrumental works have been recorded, one way or another, but never this one.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, naturally you’ll want to see the music before committing.  \r\n\r\nIf you’re interested, please reply “affirmative” … I’ll know what it means and will send you PDFs of the score and parts.

The skills and experiences that prove effective in one of these two hemispheres are generally less valuable in the other.  \r\n\r\nMost composers seem to choose one of these hemispheres as their dwelling place, occasionally visiting the other.\r\n\r\nThere is communication between the two hemispheres as, for example, when teachers of instruments tell their students to “make it sing.”  Or when choral directors prod choristers to make instrumental effects, such as staccato or legato.\r\n\r\nBut the two hemispheres are separated chiefly by the presence or absence of words.  \r\n\r\nWords are the singer’s bane, a challenge of which instrumentalists know nothing.  Singers must often struggle with vowels that pinch the voice and with consonants that simply cannot be sung.  Try singing an “S” or a “J.”  Or a word like “which.”  You will quickly see the challenge and understand why listeners often find it difficult to understand a text that is being sung, which is why texts are often printed in concert programs or church bulletins.\r\n\r\nSung words have specific meanings which the singers must respect, express, convey.  Blessed are the instrumentalists! — for they make music with no such concerns.\r\n\r\nOf course, singers don’t have to sing words.  Vocal music can be wordless.  A composer can ask singers to intone no other sound than “ahhh” or “oooh.”  Think of the vocalises by Rachmaninoff and Villa Lobos or the wordless women’s chorus in Debussy’s Sirènes.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Alleluia.  Four lovely vowels.  An affirmation, yes, but only vaguely meaningful for most folks.  What does the word mean?  Well, it’s an adaptation into English of the Hebrew phrase “hallalu-ya” which means “praise ye Jehovah."\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Lexington Junior High School in 1962, my 7th grade choir & general music teacher, Roderick Evans, started me composing when, having noticed me messing around on the piano before class began, coaxed me into writing a little Alleluia.\r\n\r\n“What’s an Alleluia,” I asked.  “It’s a piece of music where the choir sings that one word, ‘Alleluia,’ over and over again and then, at the end, they sing ‘Amen’ and that’s it.  When you get home after school, fool around on the piano and, tomorrow, bring me four notes, one for each syllable: Al-le-lu-ia.”  I did as he asked.  He said my four notes were good and he suggested what should come next.  Within a few weeks I had written my first real piece of music (actually, he did most of the work, as I hadn''t yet mastered music notation) and Mr. Evans led our choir in the premiere performance in the school''s annual spring concert.  It was a big deal for me.  I’ve been composing music ever since.\r\n\r\nYears later, in 2000, I returned to the Alleluia, writing for our Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church’s chancel choir here in Cincinnati.  It’s a two-part canon, a melody sung by the combined sopranos and altos, the combined tenors and basses echoing the melody alwys a measure behind.  Our director, my good friend Chris Miller, had the choir stand in a ring around the sanctuary, surrounding the seated congregation, rendering the piece ‘stereophonically.’  ‘Surround-sound’ in church!  Very cool.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Cincinnati Camerata under the direction of Chris Miller singing my Alleluia, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJan. 24, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week, a friend sent me an mp3 recording of the Harvard Choral Fellows singing my “Alleluia.”  It’s a lovely performance and below you’ll find links to the recording and to a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nFor a composer, the world of music is divided into two hemispheres:  instrumental music and vocal music.  The skills and experiences that prove effective in one of these two hemispheres are generally less valuable in the other.  \r\n\r\nThere is communication between the two hemispheres as, for example, when instrumentalists are told to “make it sing.”  Or when choral directors prod choristers to sing with the precision we expect from instrumentalists:   staccatos, accents, legato phrasing, percussive diction.\r\n\r\nIn one hemisphere, words are of supreme importance; in the other, they hold no sway.\r\n\r\nVocalists struggle to sing vowels that pinch the throat and consonants that are simply un-singable.  Try singing a consonant.  Choose one, any one.  Can’t be done.  Well, I guess you could sing a “Z.”  Or hum an “M.”  But who wants to hear it?  Try singing the word “which” as a long note.   You will also understand why English-speaking audiences are often unable to understand texts sung in their own language.  (Italians, I am told, do not have this problem.)  When English is to be sung, it is advisable to print and distribute the text to the attendees.\r\n\r\nWords have meanings which singers strive to express.  Blessed are the instrumentalists! — for they make music under no such constraints.  B flats and F sharps have musical meanings, of course, but they are never ambiguous in the ways words are.  Notes, tones, pitches cannot be misunderstood.\r\n\r\nToo, let us recall concert-goers like me who “don’t hear so well anymore.”\r\n\r\nA train pulls into a station with three elderly Englishmen on board.\r\n\r\nOne says, “This must be Wembley.”\r\n\r\n“I thought it was Thursday.”\r\n\r\n“So am I.  Let’s get a beer.”\r\n\r\nOf course, vocal music can be wordless.  Singers may intone only an “ahhh” or an “oooh.”  Think of the vocalises by Rachmaninoff and Villa Lobos or the wordless women’s chorus in Debussy’s “Sirènes.”  Or the off-stage choir during the storm scene that opens Verdi’s “Otello."\r\n\r\nThen there is the Alleluia.  Not a text.  Four lovely vowels, no ugly consonants.  What does the word mean?  An affirmation, yes, but only vaguely understood.  Can you define the word?  \r\n\r\nIt’s an adaptation into English of the Hebrew phrase, “hallalu-ya,” meaning “praise ye Jehovah.”  But you don’t need to know that in order to relish the word.  It is an incantation and the reasons to sing the word have everything to do with joyful gratitude, and but little to do with rationality.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a student at Lexington Junior High School in 1962 — that’s Lexington, Ohio — my 7th grade Choir & General Music teacher, Roderick Evans noticed me messing around on the piano before class began.  He asked me what I was playing.  \r\n\r\n“Oh, just some things I made up.”  \r\n\r\n“You must write an Alleluia for the choir to sing in our spring concert.\r\n\r\n“What’s an Alleluia?” \r\n\r\n“It’s a piece of music where the choir sings the word ‘Alleluia’ over and over again and then, at the end, they sing ‘Amen.’  When you get home from school, fool around on the piano and, tomorrow, bring me four notes, one for each syllable: Al-le-lu-ia.”  \r\n\r\nI did what he asked.  It took about 45 seconds.  He said he liked the four notes I had chosen and he suggested what should come next:  four more notes, with the same shape, only a step higher.  Then eight more notes in the same mood, after that.  Boom, a phrase was born.  Then another phrase, as long as the first.  Then a third phrase, as long as the first two phrases combined.  Boom, a composer was born.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks I had written my first real piece of music (Mr. Evans did most of the work, as I hadn''t yet mastered music notation).  As promised, our class choir sang it in the spring concert.  Mr. Evans told the audience that it was “the world premiere,” a term new to me.  \r\n\r\nMy parents were there.  People applauded.  It was a big deal.  \r\n\r\nIn the next 50 years I composed 400 pieces of music .\r\n\r\nIn 2000, I returned to the challenge of writing “an Alleluia,” this time for our Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church’s chancel choir, here in Cincinnati.  It’s a two-part canon:  the melody is sung by the women and echoed by the men, a beat later.  When our director, my good friend Chris Miller, leads the choir in the singing of this piece, we encircle the seated congregation, alternating male and female singers, rendering the piece in ‘Surround-sound.’ \r\n\r\nTo hear the Harvard Choral Fellows singing my Alleluia under the direction of my friend Carson Cooman, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),13);

Now they feel they must step back from the Sanctuary movement to try to safeguard their congregation and their Imam.\r\n\r\nBomb threats?  death threats?  in Cincinnati? ... our quiet, lovable, richly blessed, mid-American city?  Yes.  I live in the heart of the city; the mosque is just a mile away.  The people making those threats are my neighbors, my fellow Cincinnatians.\r\n\r\nA dark beast — energized by fear and hatred of The Other — has been awakened and exploited.  The irony is obvious:  our land is peopled almost entirely by immigrants and by the descendants of immigrants, all of whom were The Other, once upon a time.\r\n\r\nThe challenge this presents our country is a subject that is too big for me.  \r\n\r\nI’m only qualified to comment on one tiny, trivial aspect of the subject:  the challenge our immigrant heritage poses for an American composer.   \r\n\r\nTo write authentic music, American composers must know who they are, where they are and where they come from.  They must figure out how to express and extend these realities, musically, in the America of their own time.\r\n\r\nMy father''s ancestors were French.  Johannes Sauvage arrived in Boston in 1737.  (The origin of “Sowash” is the French family name “Sauvage.”)   During the American Revolution, his grandsons served in the Continental Army.   Our family had long since ceased speaking French by the time I came along.  I learned the language in college, improving my skills in subsequent visits to France.  I have found much to admire in French culture and I love to think of "la belle France" as the land of my ancestors.  For two-and-a-half years now, I’ve been joyfully teaching French to young people.  Some of my music sounds a little French-y.  \r\n\r\nMy mother''s parents were Austro-Hungarians, from what is called Serbia today, though they considered themselves Germans, not Serbs.   They arrived in Crestline, Ohio around 1900.  My great-grandmother, Sophia Hoff, quickly learned that if she wore her beautiful headscarf in public she would be treated very badly.  Her son, my grandfather, John Hoff, was relentlessly beaten up at school until he learned enough English and mustered the courage to stand up for himself.  I heard these stories, growing up, along with contrasting stories of how the kindness and compassion of some neighbors and teachers helped the family.  I heard a lot of German as a boy, picking up the rhythm and music of the language along with a few words and phrases.  When Jo and I visited Austria the language came back to me pretty quickly.  Sure enough, some of my works have an Eastern European sound.\r\n\r\nYet I am neither French nor German-Serbian.  I am American and my music has an American sound, identifying me accordingly.   \r\n\r\nI wrote my clarinet quintet in response to some of the European musical structures.  Think of the four movements as four glasses, made in Europe, each with a different shape, each filled with American wine.  \r\n\r\nThe last movement of the quintet is my take on Brahms’ Hungarian Dances, my attempt to extend that very Austro-Hungarian genre into a contemporary American context.\r\n\r\nThe resulting music sounds … how shall I term it? … Austro-Hungarian-American?   The temperature is gradually turned up and once the music gets cooking, it''s a full-scale kerfuffle.  American goulash!    \r\n\r\nHow fortunate I am, that such wonderful musicians have recorded this music!

What is stranger than the passing of time?\r\n\r\nIf I told you that I wrote this song yesterday, you would believe me because the music itself is somewhat removed from the way we usually think about chronology, eras, epochs.  \r\n\r\nHearing it, when would you guess it was written?  It had to have been written sometime after about 1930 because it has an identifiably American sound, a style of musical expression that didn’t exist until about then.  \r\n\r\nThe music is also somewhat outside the familiar song genres.  It doesn’t quite fit into the realms of Tin Pan Alley or Broadway or the Beatles or Joni Mitchell, let alone anything to be found in the current Top Forty.\r\n\r\nFor you, at this moment, it’s here and it’s now.  It’s brand new! \r\n\r\nFor me, this thought elicits the same pleasant little shock that comes when I reflect that I am more than 50 years older than the students to whom I teach French.  \r\n\r\nI always get a laugh from the students when I refer to myself as their school’s ''Oldest Living Teacher.''  \r\n\r\nWhen we’re happily splashing in French together, gargling pronunciations, tossing the language back and forth like a beach ball, venturing into the deep end of the pool as we attempt to  discuss abstract topics, I feel like an equal, an insider, part of the gang, a member of the team, one of the group.  \r\n\r\nSure, I’m the teacher.

Last Thursday, for some reason, we started speaking in “les voix amusantes” (funny voices).  We spoke French, yes, but we did it using our versions of famous funny voices:  Mickey Mouse’s falsetto, Gabby Hayes’ toothless old prospector, the ominous growl of the Grim Reaper, Porky Pig’s stutter:  “Buh-dit, uh, buh-dit, uh, Bonjour!”  \r\n\r\nIt was hilarious.

I never know what to say to artists.”\r\n\r\n“Praise them!” he says, with the air of a man who knows what he’s talking about.  “Just praise them!” he repeats.  “You can’t go wrong!”\r\n\r\nHa!  He’s right!  Let’s admit it.  Artists yearn to be praised; his advice is both funny and apt.\r\n\r\nYet the whole truth is not so flip.  Praise is all well and good for anyone, but what artists need most, especially young artists, is to connect with someone who takes them seriously.\r\n\r\nDo you know a young artist?  A painter, a poet, a writer, a composer?  Take them seriously;  engage with them; ask them about the creative work they’re doing, just now.  \r\n\r\nHow grateful I am to the handful of wonderful musicians who took  me seriously, early on, by engaging with my music in ways that went far beyond performance.  They inspired me, they asked me to write new works specially for them; they absorbed my music and made suggestions that rendered it more effective.  They taught me so much; they raised me to levels I could not have reached by myself.  \r\n\r\nAmong these musicians have been cellist Terry King, clarinetist Angelo Santoro, choral directors Chris Miller, Kevin Kelly and Gregg Smith.  And mezzo-soprano Diane Haslam.\r\n\r\nDiane once asked for songs she could sing with a flutist friend as well as a pianist.  Her first name being the English derivation of Diana, Goddess of the Moon, I thought of setting Walter De La Mare''s wonderful little poem about moonlight entitled, “Silver."\r\n\r\nThe flute itself is silver in color and it makes a silvery sound.  In other poems by De La Mare, I found that the word “silver” frequently recurred.  For Diane, I wrote a cycle of five short songs, setting five of his poems, all of which featured the word, “silver.” \r\n\r\nTake a moment and read “Silver."\r\n\r\nSlowly, silently, now the moon\r\nWalks the night in her silver shoon;\r\nThis way, and that, she peers, and sees\r\nSilver fruit upon silver trees;\r\nOne by one the casements catch\r\nHer beams beneath the silvery thatch;\r\nCouched in his kennel, like a log,\r\nWith paws of silver sleeps the dog....\r\nA harvest mouse goes scampering by,\r\nWith silver claws, and silver eye;\r\nAnd moveless fish in the water gleam,\r\nBy silver reeds in a silver stream.\r\n\r\n“Shoon” is quaint and sweetly affected but “moveless" stops my breath.  Only a genius could conceive and position in precisely the right place a word so improbable yet so perfect.\r\n\r\nMusic can never be ‘moveless.’  It moves through time, sometimes moves us emotionally.  Still I did my best to write a “moveless” song.  See what you think …\r\n\r\nHow beautifully Diane Haslam sang my Silvery Songs.  I regret we never recorded her renditions.

It’s titled “Silver.” \r\n\r\nI wrote it in 1999 for my English mezzo friend, Diane Haslam.  It’s one of 28 songs I wrote for her.\r\n\r\nIt sets to music a poem of the same title by Walter de la Mare.  Because the flute itself is silver-colored and makes a silvery sound I scored the song for mezzo, flute and piano.  \r\n\r\nThe word “silver” apparently held a special significance for de la Mare.  I found four other poems by him in which he employed the word and I set those to music as well, making a cycle of five short songs, which I titled “Silvery Songs.”\r\n\r\nTake a moment and put yourself under the spell of this poem, “Silver."  The first word of the poem indicates the tempo at which it is best read or sung ...\r\n\r\n	Slowly, silently, now the moon\r\n	Walks the night in her silver shoon;\r\n	This way, and that, she peers, and sees\r\n	Silver fruit upon silver trees;\r\n	One by one the casements catch\r\n	Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;\r\n	Couched in his kennel, like a log,\r\n	With paws of silver sleeps the dog.\r\n	A harvest mouse goes scampering by,\r\n	With silver claws, and silver eye;\r\n	And moveless fish in the water gleam,\r\n	By silver reeds in a silver stream.\r\n\r\nSome curious words there.  “Shoon” is sweetly old-fashioned as are “casements” and “thatch.” Their quaintness is touching, but “moveless" stops my breath.  An improbable word, never seen it anywhere else that I know of.  It is perfect.  As if by magic, the word escorts me into the silent, moonlit stream and leaves me hovering there, alongside the fish, moveless, silver and pure.\r\n\r\nMusic is never ‘moveless.’  It moves through time, its melodies rising and falling and we are moved emotionally.  Still, I did my best to write a “moveless” song.  It may be untoward to say so but when I listen to this song now, it really does seem to me to be perfect.  I wonder if Walter de la Mare would agree.\r\n\r\nSee what you think as you listen … and remember to watch for the full moon tonight!\r\n\r\nHow beautifully Diane sang my Silvery Songs.

This gives the music a heady, lighter-than-air feeling; the singers and listeners have the sensation of floating through the piece ... like the three men in a boat (to say nothing of the dog).\r\n\r\nWhen you click the link below you''ll hear the piece enthusiastically sung by the Chancel Choir of the Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church, where I am to be found among the baritones every Sunday morning.  That''s Chris Miller directing, than whom there is no more ardent advocate of my music and for whose friendship and artistry I am immensely grateful.\r\n\r\nMost likely, this will be the only time you''ll ever hear this piece, as recorded in concert a few years ago.  It won''t be on a CD so it will never be broadcast on the radio.  Hardly anybody knows it exists, so it''s almost never performed.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Let Your Boat of Life Be Light” sung by the Mt.

Also the TV westerns I grew up watching:  Wagon Train, Bonanza, The Rifleman, Gunsmoke.  \r\n\r\nTo my generation, those themes are what The West sounds like.\r\n\r\nThose scores have an expansive sweep, a galloping excitement; they evoke high-spirited adventure and the feel of wide-open spaces,  My challenge was to capture a little of all that in a work scored for just three humble instruments.\r\n\r\nLike a ‘good guy’ in a cowboy movie, I did my best.  \r\n\r\nThe five movements I came up with were inspired by five photographs of Mt. Emily, the most prominent feature of the landscape near LaGrande, OR, the trio’s home town.  The photos were the work of Carol Haddock, sister of Elizabeth Cooper, the trio’s pianist.  The titles Carol selected for her photographs also serve as the titles for my five movements.\r\n\r\nWhen the third piece, "Here Comes Spring," was finished, I quietly announced, “My work here is done.”  \r\n\r\nAs I rode off, the musicians asked one another, “Who was that man?”  \r\n\r\nA puzzled pause ensued.  \r\n\r\nFinally, one of them said, “Why, that was The Lone Composer.”\r\n\r\n“Heigh-yo, Silver!

It''s one of life’s great pleasures.\r\n\r\nStill, twenty minutes is enough.  Much longer and this great pleasure turns irksome.\r\n\r\nHappiness is not like that.  For one thing, you know right away when something is pleasurable but oftentimes you don’t realize how happy you were until you look back.  In fact, in my experience, it’s rare to be totally happy and to KNOW, at that very moment, that you ARE totally happy.  I can count on one hand the number of such moments I’ve experienced. \r\n\r\nOne came last December, when I took a bow after the superb and, for me, unforgettable, performance of my cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus.  \r\n\r\nWhen the last note sounded and the conductor motioned me to join the performers on the stage, I leapt to my feet, rushed forward, embraced the soloists, shook the conductor’s hand and took my bow.  I was so happy that I found myself lifting my hands and eyes upward though I can’t explain exactly why.  I could not stop smiling, though there were tears in my eyes.  \r\n\r\nIt was one of the supremely happy moments of my life, right up there with the day I was married and the days on which our two children entered the world, healthy and whole.  \r\n\r\nAll this begs the question, what do we mean when we use that word “happy”?\r\n\r\n“Happiness,” Aristotle said, “is the exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope.”\r\n\r\nThat’s a muscular, dynamic definition, primal, Greek, Western.  No mention of our duty to God or humble service to others or letting go of selfish desires or opting for love instead of power.\r\n\r\nFor an aspiring Christian like myself, Aristotle’s is definition is incomplete, though galvanizing.  It has served me well and I commend it to others.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, on the last day of the school year in the school where I teach (in addition to four levels of French, I also teach courses in Music Theory, and the Art of Storytelling), I wrote Aristotle’s definition on the blackboard and challenged the students to ponder it, to ask themselves how it applied to them, how they measured their own notions of happiness against it.\r\n\r\n“What are your vital powers?” I asked them.  “Some of mine are music, writing, storytelling and teaching."\r\n\r\n“Once you’ve discovered your vital powers,” I said, "exercise them!  Learn all you can about the fields of action where such powers are in play.  Find someone who has mastered the skills required to join in the play and ask that person to teach you what they know.\r\n\r\n"Practice your vital powers along lines of excellence, doing the best you can.  When you do the best you can, even if you fail, as you sometimes will, you can look back and say, ‘Well, at least I did the best I could.’  This will be a great comfort.  It has been for me.\r\n\r\n“What does Aristotle mean by ‘scope?’  He means you’ve got to create for yourself an adequately large field of action for your talents.  It’s not enough to simply do you own thing as best you can, all by yourself in some obscure corner. You’ve got to find an audience!  You’ve got to bring your gifts to ‘the world,’ whatever you understand that to mean."\r\n\r\nI don’t know how much they got out of all this but they were listening.  I could see it in their eyes.\r\n\r\nHow much scope DO we need to make us happy?  Aristotle can''t say because each of us must answer that question for ourselves.  \r\n\r\nScope is tricky.  One’s first thought would likely be:  “The more scope, the better!”\r\n\r\nBut it’s not that simple.  There were only three students in my most advanced French class this year.  Would my scope have been greater if there had been thirty?  or three hundred?  No.  In fact, greater numbers would have reduced the scope.\r\n\r\nWith just three students, I was able to work closely, helping them master the subtleties of pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar.  Three students gave me plenty of scope and I was very happy all year long.\r\n\r\nConsider the roster of recipients for these emails you kindly permit me to send your way each week.  Three-and-a-half years ago I started by sending them to about a hundred friends and fans.  These recipients sometimes forwarded the emails to others who subsequently signed up to receive them.  \r\n\r\nThe total number of recipients has grown to six hundred.\r\n\r\nThe scope has increased numerically but my happiness in sharing these messages has neither increased nor decreased.  I am just as happy sharing them now with six hundred as I was when I shared them with one hundred.  I still think of y’all as a small group of friends.  And if the number would grow to six thousand, I would be no happier, I know, than I am, right now, writing this message for you.  \r\n\r\nThe right amount of scope is in the eyes of the beholder and each of us must decide for ourselves how much scope is enough to render us happy.\r\n\r\nBut enough philosophizing.  Let’s listen to some happy music!\r\n\r\nTo hear “Good Morning, Miss Emily,” the opening movement of my Trio #4 for violin, clarinet and piano, subtitled “Images of Mt.

It might serve as the musical backdrop for a love scene or a montage of beautiful western scenery.  I saved the rootin-tootin’ stuff for the other, more ripsnorting movements.  The music in this movement is appropriately “reflective.”   It’s a tender prayer ending with a quiet plagal cadence, like a congregation singing “Amen” at the closing bars of a hymn.\r\n\r\nWhen musicians request the PDFs of the score and parts for this Trio, subtitled “Images of Mt. Emily,” I always send along Carol Haddock''s five photos as well, suggesting that the musicians arrange to have each photo projected during the playing of the movement that it inspired.  Audiences love to see these photos.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Reflections” from Trio #4 for violin, clarinet & piano: Images of Mt.

Really?  \r\n\r\nIn the context of all that’s transpiring, yet another ‘dose & thimbleful’ is absurd, I know.  Nevertheless … the sharing of thoughts and tunes might ease matters a little.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, when I began sending weekly emails to ‘friends and fans,’ I did not foresee that it would become a sort of ‘ministry’ during a dark time. \r\n\r\nWriting these weekly emails lifts my spirits.  I tweak ‘this week’s message’ every day and plan the upcoming series.  It gives me something to do other than chores, riding the bike trail, painting toy soldiers and “rustlin’ up some grub fer supper.” \r\n\r\nI sometimes feel a little silly doing this in such a dire time, like someone passing out ginger snaps to shipmates as we all sink.  \r\n\r\nThen again, if I actually found myself on a sinking ship and someone slipped me a ginger snap, I would be grateful.  I am very fond of ginger snaps!  Munching a crunchy ginger snap while the water swirled about my ankles would be a whole lot better than just standing there, hoping the Coast Guard will arrive in time.\r\n\r\nSo … let’s recall that it’s October, the favorite month of many.  The trees are ecstatic, “trooping their colors and shouting hosannas.” \r\n\r\nOctober is evoked in my "Harvest Time: Prayer & Hymn," the final movement of my Trio #4 for violin, clarinet and piano, “Images of Mt. Emily”  commissioned by the Trio da Camera of LaGrande, Oregon.  The five movements respond to photographs of Mt. Emily, the most prominent feature of the landscape near LaGrande, made by Carol Haddock, sister of the trio’s pianist, Elizabeth Cooper.  \r\n\r\nThe outline of the mountain is musically represented, first by a sustained high note to evoke the mountain''s flat summit, next by notes that descend and then rise a bit, as the mountain''s outline. ''reading'' from left to right, slopes down, slightly up, then down again.\r\n\r\nThis musical silhouette of Mt. Emily is heard at the beginning of the opening and final movements, a tribute to this changeless, feminine mountain.  I like to think that dear old Mt. Emily is amused by the doings of the hasty, short-lived humans who dwell in her shadow.  \r\n\r\nIn the titles of the five movements, Emily''s human neighbors wish her good morning, observe her reflection in water, rejoice in the coming of spring, memorialize their dead and, in the last movement, offer prayers and hymns of Thanksgiving for the harvest.  \r\n\r\nAll the while Mt. Emily, is simply there, ancient and majestic.\r\n\r\nThe finale movement,  "Harvest Time: Prayer & Hymn," opens with the outline of Mt. Emily, followed by a tender prayer, then a hymn (originally written to be sung at a party celebrating a major birthday of another great feminine spirit, our friend Nan Costello).  Lastly, the musical silhouette of Mt. Emily returns, ending the piece.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Harvest Time: Prayer & Hymn" beautifully played by three fine Cincinnati musicians -- violinist Nick Naegele, clarinetist Jeff Carwile and pianist Mark Tollefsen -- click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see the photo that inspired this movement, copy and paste this link:\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/harvest_time.jpg\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),61);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(88,replace(replace('At our church choir’s annual June pool party, we’d been chatting, poolside, about the real names of movie stars like Cary Grant, John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe.  An English professor, the star of our bass section, seized the moment to reveal his knowledge of the real names of authors better known by their pen names:  George Eliot, Saki, Lewis Carroll, O.Henry, George Orwell.  \r\n\r\nThe imp on my left shoulder prompted me to ask him if he knew Walt Whitman’s real name.  Caught off guard, his eyes jerked left and right as he ran a quick search through his gray cells and came up short.  “No,” he said, “I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, a little ashamed of myself for baiting the good man, “his real name was …. \r\n\r\n								Walter!”\r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nOne day, just over a half century ago, I pulled a fat, thick book from a shelf in my high school’s library.  It was titled “Leaves of Grass.”  “Blades of Grass” would have made sense.  But leaves?  Grass doesn’t come in leaves.  So what was this book?\r\n\r\nI might have wondered how anyone could write such a long book about various strains of grass.  Fifteen years old, I knew nothing about the book, had never heard of its famous title.  \r\n\r\nEven when I opened it, I didn’t at first realize that it was a book of poetry.  I grew up hearing a lot of poems read aloud to me by my grandfather and by my mother, poems like “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” “The House With Nobody In It,” “The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,” and “The Village Blacksmith.”  \r\n\r\nThe writing in Leaves of Grass was nothing like those poems.  Most of the sentences were very long and none of them, so far as I could see, ended the way I thought lines of poetry were supposed end:  with a word that rhymes with the end of the line that comes right before it.   \r\n\r\nIn the table of contents I spotted a section oddly entitled “Song of Myself.”  Was this a song book?  I flipped through.  Nope.  There was no music notation anywhere in it.  \r\n\r\nI sat down and started reading “Song of Myself.”  I remember my growing amazement.  “Who IS this man, this Walt Whitman?” I wondered.  “How could one person ever BE all these things?  Is he really talking about his actual self? or is he talking about the self of someone he’s made up?  Or is he just bragging that he’s done all these things when he really hasn’t done any of them?"\r\n\r\nI vaguely wondered if “myself” meant something different to this Walt Whitman than the word meant to me.  Reading “Song of Myself” was baffling but intriguing.  It made me wonder about all sorts of things.  The main thing I felt was amazement.\r\n\r\nI am no longer much-ly amazed by most of the things that amazed me much-ly when I was fifteen.  But I am still amazed by Walt Whitman.  Much-ly!\r\n\r\nI love his long, long poems …\r\n\r\nUncle Walt (as a friend calls him, and I like that moniker) gave us a good many long poems  but he gave us many wonderful short poems, too, marvels of truth and simplicity.  \r\n\r\nHere comes one.\r\n\r\nWinter has just drawn to its close, and Uncle Walt, out for a walk, sees a dandelion “emerging,” the first he’s seen that year.  Could there be a humbler topic for a poem?  See, just see, what he finds to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n	The First Dandelion\r\n\r\n	Simple and fresh and fair, from winter''s close emerging, \r\n	As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics had ever been,\r\n	Forth from its sunny nook of shelter''d grass, \r\n	Innocent, golden, calm as the dawn, \r\n	The spring''s first dandelion shows its trustful face.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poem opens its trustful face, asks only that we return its gaze.  It is immediately and entirely comprehensible.  It does not ask us to search for hidden meanings.  The poem, like the dandelion, is right there in front of you, "simple and fresh and fair."  The poem and the dandelion are quietly going about their business; they mean precisely themselves, nothing more, \r\n\r\nFor Uncle Walt, that’s miracle enough.\r\n\r\nCould a piece of music be so clean?  Using only musical sounds, could a composer emulate that poem, that dandelion?  \r\n\r\nI tried many a time over the next fifty years, as when I wrote “Morning," the opening movement of my Trio #10 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Winds of May.”  (The other movements are entitled “Dark Forest,” “Wildflowers” and “Sunset.”)\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing “Morning," the opening movement of Trio #10, “Winds of May,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 7, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nEvery week, right on schedule, without fail, I am blessed with two 75-minute windows of time through which, together with people I love, I get to peep at and ponder things rich, rare, lovely and profound.\r\n\r\nBoth begin at 11 a.m. and end at 12:15 p.m.\r\n\r\nOne is the Sunday worship service at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nThe other is the Wednesday class I teach, “Music Theory & History,” at a school with an improbable name:  “Leaves of Learning.”\r\n\r\n(You know the phrase, “leaves of absence.”  Our students are on “leaves of learning,” i.e., they’ve taken leave of their homes to come learn at our school.  At least that’s my take on the name of our school.)\r\n\r\nFive bright, serious, thoughtful, sometimes funny students — Grace, Chad, Aaron, Gavin and Chris, aged 15 to 17 — venture with me into realms of speculation, as we ponder together one of  the Great Questions:  \r\n\r\n				How does music MEAN?\r\n\r\nThat is, or ought to be, the central question in the study of “Music Theory.”  \r\n\r\n“Ugh.  I had to take Music Theory.  I HATED it!”  \r\n\r\nSaddened, frustrated, enraged … those are my feelings when I hear fine musicians say that.\r\n\r\nHow can this be?  Here it is, like a great feast spread before us, the most absorbing of topics, central to the art of every musician and the experience of every music-lover … and they HATE it?\r\n\r\nWhy?  Because it is often so badly taught.  Because the instructors lose sight of the subject matter, namely that music is a metaphor for our experience of the world, of life.\r\n\r\nIn our “Music Theory & History” course we examine the precise means composers have employed to fashion metaphors.  We consider the shapes, harmonies, rhythms and structures they devised to convey the meanings they found in their experience of the world, of life.\r\n\r\nThe class alternates between lecture, listening and discussion.  I lead, direct, emote.  My reaction to music is physical. As we listen together I indulge in a curious ''interpretive dance'' I find myself wanting to do, whenever I listen intently to music.   I keep still in a concert hall so as not to distract my fellow listeners, but in the classroom I allow myself to MOVE, weaving the air, yearning for the infinite, executing a slow spin now and then and a little footwork.  No one laughs because my sincerity is evident.  The students accept it from the start; it is apparent to them that “this is what Mr. Sowash is going to do when he listens to music with us.”\r\n\r\nCome, visit my class, right now.  (Sorry, but you won’t get to see the ‘interpretive dance’ component).  Together, let’s consider one aspect of one movement of one work from my own fertile pen.  It’s from my Trio #10 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Winds of May”; it''s the second movement, “Wildflowers.”  \r\n\r\nLet’s consider which instruments are playing when … and why.\r\n\r\nIf you were seated in a concert hall, observing a clarinetist, a cellist and a pianist coming on stage, then poised, seated, ready to play, you might expect all three musicians to play continuously throughout the performance.  That could happen.  It’s one possibility.  If all three play continuously, that alone will MEAN a certain something:  a metaphor of continuity, unity, cooperation.\r\n\r\nAre those the qualities I want to evoke in this particular movement?  No.\r\n\r\nThis movement is entitled “Wildflowers.”  Are wildflowers continuous, unified, cooperative?  Is that how we experience them?  Walking in a spring woods, coming upon wildflowers, do we experience them all together, all at once?  No.\r\n\r\nWildflowers press themselves upon our consciousness in varying patterns, often one or two at a time.  As we saunter along, we leave their colors behind us, only to find those same colors re-appearing in front of us a little later, sometimes separately, sometimes in a cluster or ’stand’ of the same species; still other times we glimpse several varieties at once, in close proximity.\r\n\r\nHow can this simple phenomenon be conveyed in music?  How did one particular composer, (the undersigned), answer that question to his own satisfaction and, hopefully, yours?\r\n\r\nThe quest for answers to questions like that one is what renders Music Theory so exciting, so fascinating.\r\n\r\nLet me guide you through this short movement with a simple, easy-to-follow chronological ‘map.’  If you want to listen as you follow me, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/may_wildflowers.mp3\r\n\r\nIt begins with a lilting, descending figure in the piano.\r\n\r\nAt :07 the piano exits and the cello enters, rising, the clarinet answering immediately, falling.  They form a duet, two wildflowers standing side by side, a bluebell and a trillium, spontaneously arising from the green forest floor.\r\n\r\nAt :47, having said what they have to say, the cello and the clarinet cease playing, they go silent for now.  We move on, leaving those flowers behind.\r\n\r\nFrom :48 the piano wends a winding path through a stand of a single variety, perhaps "a host of golden daffodils."   The piano is the only ‘color'' we hear.  The other instruments are at rest.  At 2:32 the piano goes silent.  We’ve moved on again.\r\n\r\nAt 2:37, so shyly, so tentatively, so unsure of itself, the cello creeps into our vision again, or rather, this being music, our hearing, playing a rising figure, as when it first raised its voice.\r\n\r\nAt 2:44 the clarinet joins the cello with a falling figure.  It makes a satisfying symmetry because -- remember?  — we heard this same music at the opening of the movement.  The tune has returned to us.  Or have we returned to it?  Wildflowers are stationery.  They do not move among us.  It is we who have been moving among them.\r\n\r\nTogether the cello and the clarinet make it clear, make it simple, make it sing.\r\n\r\nAt 3:50 they play the falling figure you heard when the piano began the movement, as if they are inviting the piano to join them.  Sure enough, she does, at 3:53.  \r\n\r\nIn the whole of this little movement, the ending phrase marks the first and only time when all three instruments play together, contributing to the final chord.  They make a lovely threesome, the bluebell, the trillium and the daffodil, a trio of wildflowers waiting for us, together, at the end of our little walk in the woods.\r\n\r\nVoilà!  A metaphor!\r\n\r\nNow, THAT is Music Theory!  And, since I wrote this music fifteen years ago, I guess it qualifies as Music History, too!\r\n\r\nSo much to discover and enjoy, merely by considering which instruments were playing when and why.  We could undertake similar explorations considering the shapes of the melodies, the choice of the harmonies, rhythms and dynamics, the handling of the instruments’ various registers, the era, the style, the nationalist musical traditions that are evoked, all of which could contribute a great deal more to our understanding of the metaphor rendered by this one short piece of modest music.  We might go on to  compare it to other pieces, written earlier or later, perceiving influences and intuiting prophecies.  \r\n\r\nNow listen again, this time without a map and an overly talkative guide.  \r\n\r\n		“Here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears."\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing “Wildflowers," the third movement of Trio #10, “Winds of May,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“If you can do it, there’s nothing to it.”\r\n\r\nTake my son, for instance.  Chapman walks into a New Orleans bar with his trombone case under his arm.  In short order the band waves him up onto the stage.  He doesn’t have to ask the name of the song they’re playing or what key they’re in.  He jumps in and anyone would think he’d been playing with that band for years.\r\n\r\nIf I try to tell him how amazing this is, he shrugs.  Nothing to it.\r\n\r\nI’m a piano player but not a pianist.  My mother was a classical pianist with a far better technique than I ever acquired.  As a boy, I rarely practiced in the usual sense though I spent hours messing about, making up stuff.  I can slap a piano around OK but I was never much interested in playing music.  I wanted to write it.  I’m not a musician; I’m a composer.\r\n\r\nI did figure out, early on, the most important trick to playing a piano:  when you hit a wrong note, hit it again right away so that it seems you hit it intentionally.  Then just slide from the wrong note to a neighboring note, which will almost always be the right note, and keep on playing as if nothing happened.  “If you can do it, there’s nothing to it."\r\n\r\nWhat about creative work?  If you want to create, put yourself in the way of an idea.  Here’s an analogy (I dislike it; can you think of a better one?):  if you want to get hit by a train, you have to stand on the track.  You can’t just  wander around the countryside complaining that other people get hit by trains, but never you.  No.  You must find a track and position yourself between the rails.\r\n\r\nWhen I was writing my Trio #10 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled ‘Winds of May,” I had completed three bright movements entitled “Morning,” “Wildflowers” and “Sunset.”  Now I needed a dark movement.  I put myself on the track, so to speak, by asking myself what darkness one might expect in a trio entitled “Winds of May.”\r\n\r\nI thought of a deep, dark forest of huge, mossy, old-growth trees, their dense leaf-canopies obscuring the sunlight.  “Deep Forest” would be the name of the dark movement.  \r\n\r\nClearly, the cello, unaccompanied, must introduce the tune because the cello is the most tree-like of those three instruments.  I knew that the tune should be in the Dorian mode because that mode has a surprising feature:  though the third degree of the mode is a gloomy minor, the sixth degree is a sunny major, like a shaft of sunlight piercing the canopy of leaves, briefly blessing the wildflowers flourishing far below.  (“Deep Forest” is the second movement, followed by “Wildflowers” which I shared last week.)\r\n\r\nI sat at the piano, fooling around down low, sounding the notes the piano shares with the cello’s lowest register, staying within the Dorian mode.  I soon found a tune.  (If you can do it, there’s nothing to it.)  \r\n\r\nSometimes, if the tune is a good one, it is enough simply to let the tune be played.  No Beethovenian development is needed.  After the cello introduces the tune, the clarinet and the piano play it again, in a different key, imitating a choir of voices.  Then the cello returns with the tune in the original key and the movement ends.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a brief peek into a Deep Forest.  Composers, storytellers and speakers know:  it’s always better to leave people wanting more than to go on too long.  \r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing “Deep Forest," from the Trio #10, “Winds of May,” the briefest, breeziest and easiest-to-play of my fifteen trios for clarinet, cello and piano, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nListen to “Sunset” while slowly reading this gorgeous poem.

A flutist, she was curious to discover the music I’ve written for her instrument. \r\n\r\n“Cast your bread upon the waters and it shall return to you.”  True.  I send out my music and the gesture is returned.  My incoming ‘snail mail’ often includes delightful, handwritten thank you notes.  Some comes with checks or cash tucked inside the folded note, though I never ask for payment, quite the opposite.  Some have sent chocolates, peanut brittle (which I adore, especially with a tart Honey Crisp apple).  Some send me the fruits of their own creativity:  recordings, videos, poems, books, drawings, photographs, even paintings. \r\n\r\nEvery now and then someone sends me an inspiring vignette.\r\n\r\nHere’s one such, a remarkable account, emailed to me by the above-mentioned flutist, detailing the unique means by which she derives maximum pleasure from sunsets ...\r\n\r\n	“When you sent me your “Variations Plain and Simple” [for solo flute] you couldn''t have known about my personal daily ritual for my soul, but since you shared your music, I''ll share how I am using it.\r\n\r\n	It is an instance of finding and using hidden resources during this year of restrictions. \r\n\r\n	Fortunately, my house faces west so I can see the sunset.  Lately, I have been checking the time for the sunsets and putting it on my calendar.\r\n\r\n	I set up my music stand in front of a west-facing window.  When the sunset begins, I start practicing on my flute.  I play a phrase from the Andersen études three times and then stop and observe how the sunset has changed, then go back and practice the phrase again.  \r\n\r\n	The sunset changes slowly, so it is a little boring to just sit and watch it change, but a difficult practice spot allows just the right amount of time to pass between viewings of the sunset.\r\n\r\n	It turns out that your theme-and-variations coincides very well with the progress of a sunset.  The sunset changes in 16-measure units of time.  While I check out the change, I decide whether I want to repeat the variation I just played to do it better or if I want to just go on. \r\n\r\n	When there are no clouds, the direct sun is too bright for the eyes and there are no colors progressing and changing.  So a couple of weeks ago, I moved my music stand to a window that faces east.  I watched the effects of the sunset upon the mountain.  While there was still leaf color on the slopes, I watched the sunset glow turn the foliage from orange to red as I practiced.  The snow on the mountain top turned pink.  Gradually the whole mountain turned purple, then gray.  It was a great flute-sunset time.\r\n\r\n	Yesterday, I was playing for the mountains on the east and when they turned gray I thought I was done.  I carried my stand and flute back to the bedroom that faces west and, to my surprise, there was still a brilliant orange on the horizon!  I thought, "I know what this calls for!" and played a couple of flashy variations from Marin Marais'' "Les Folies d''Espagne."\r\n\r\n	Another option is to practice by the front door.  I have some cut glass in the side lights of my front door.  When the sun is bright and low, the light splits and casts rainbows on the hallway walls.  I can practice and watch the rainbow light move and change just an arm’s length away.\r\n\r\n	I started to realize that, especially when the sunset was really nice, it made me feel sad at the end because I was left with stark, dark, leafless trees against a gray twilight sky where, a few minutes earlier, there had been a riot of glorious colors.  \r\n\r\n	Solution?  Have a candle ready.  When the sunset is waning and I put down my flute, I light the candle and take it with me to the kitchen to start making dinner.  It helps me get past the sadness.  \r\n\r\n	Not every evening has a brilliant sunset, but I decided I wasn''t going to miss any good ones by lack of looking. \r\n\r\n	Thanks, Rick, for sending me music to enrich that experience.”\r\n\r\nIsn’t that wonderful?  I replied, thanking her in turn for sending me this splendid account.  I included the link to the final movement of my Trio #10 for clarinet, cello and piano, titled “Sunset.”  It evokes the melancholy she mentions as well as the gorgeous display of colors a setting sun sometimes shoots out.  \r\n\r\nThe sun is setting on 2020.  Look for dawn in 2021.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing “Sunset," the final movement of my Trio #10, “Winds of May,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),50);

Are you kidding?\r\n\r\nIf you follow these weekly messages, you know that I occasionally gush platitudes.\r\n\r\nSo be it.\r\n\r\nAs Thornton Wilder wrote, "If we shrink from platitudes, platitudes will shrink from us.”\r\n\r\nI’d sooner risk being termed a cheese-ball by my family, my students and my friends than remain stoically wordless about The Eternal Verities.\r\n\r\nHere is today’s platitude:\r\n\r\nThe universe, near and far, past and future, is a vast gorgeous, intricate tapestry, ceaselessly woven and rewoven, every thread of which is simultaneously ancient and new.\r\n\r\nMy prose, such as it is, can carry the thought that far but, in his lovely book, The Cabin Down the Glen, Odell Shepard says it so much better:\r\n\r\n	"The silent looms that weave the world''s beauty never linger, never pause.”\r\n\r\nTo me, that’s a magical sentence and one that demands to be sung.\r\n\r\nMy setting, for four-part chorus and piano, begins with the last four words, “Never linger, never pause,” words that seem to enjoin us to be ceaselessly active.  But those words are not a command and they do not refer to us; they refer to the silent looms on which the endless tapestry is perpetually woven.  The one who never lingers, never pauses, is the implied Weaver, not us.\r\n\r\nThe music, too, is far from suggesting frenetic activity; it is meditative, wistful, radiant, hypnotic.  The opening phrase, the singing of those four words, is an ostinato, repeated many times throughout the piece while, in counterpoint to that phrase, the rest of the thought is developed and explored.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the recordings I’ve shared with you in the past three years have been professional.  This one is not, more’s the pity.  I wish I had a perfect gem of a recording of this piece to share with you, but this is the only one I’ve got, the best I can offer.  If you don’t listen to this recording, with all its faults, you will probably never hear this piece at all.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps by following the PDF of the score, you will be able to hear beyond the recording and perceive the piece itself, shining through.  Consider it good exercise for your listening muscles.\r\n\r\nTo hear Cincinnati’s October Festival Choir sing The Endless Tapestry under the direction of Chris Miller, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 21, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nCall it what you will -- the Universe, the Mind of God, the Great Whatever -- is a vast, gorgeous, intricate tapestry, ceaselessly woven and rewoven.  Every thread is unimaginably ancient, yet new as yester-second.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wish I were a painter, expressing that idea in colors and shapes.  Instead, I’m a composer using the “colors and shapes” of music, a writer using the “colors and shapes” of words.\r\n\r\nMy prose skills can carry that thought only so far.  In his lovely book, The Cabin Down the Glen, the writer Odell Shepard expresses that same idea more simply, more clearly, more melodiously:\r\n\r\n	"The silent looms that weave the world''s beauty never linger, never pause.”\r\n\r\nThat sentence begs to be sung.\r\n\r\nMy setting of it, for four-part chorus plus flute, clarinet, bassoon and piano, begins, after a brief introduction, with the men singing those last four words, “Never linger, never pause.” \r\n\r\nAt first, those four words seem to summon us to ceaseless activity.  Look again.  Those words are not directed at us, nor do are they a command.  \r\n\r\nThe words refer to the silent looms on which the endless tapestry of Reality is perpetually woven.  It is not WE who "never linger, never pause.”  It is the implied, unnamed Weaver, tireless and eternal, who never lingers, never pauses.\r\n\r\nThe music, far from suggesting frenetic activity, is meditative, hypnotic, almost static.  The opening phrase, the singing of those four words, becomes an ostinato, repeated throughout.  In counterpoint to that phrase, the rest of the thought is developed and explored.\r\n\r\nOnly a few hundred people have heard my setting of Shepard’s words:  those in the audience when the piece was performed, twice, by Cincinnati''s October Festival Choir.  \r\n\r\nWhen I wrote the piece in 2007 I scored it for voices and piano.  When OFC founder Chris Miller decided to reprise the piece in last October’s concert, he asked me to add the flute, clarinet and bassoon.  \r\n\r\nBeing able to revise an earlier work is the composer''s advantage over painters and writers.  Once a painting is finished and sold, once a book is published, the painter / author can never again revise the work.  But a composer can readily pick up a work written decades earlier and tinker with it, again and again.\r\n\r\nChris’ idea was apt; the addition of the wind trio suggests that there are two choirs singing this music:  a choir of human voices and a wordless choir of wind instruments.  It enriches the metaphor; it’s as if the wordless Universe participates in the music-making.  That’s the whispered meaning of Shepard''s hushed, mysterious text.\r\n\r\nTo hear Cincinnati’s October Festival Choir singing the revised version of The Endless Tapestry (with winds) under Chris Miller''s direction, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),3);

There are more impressive national parks and we’ve explored many of them; but none has a stronger claim on my affection than the Shenandoah National Park.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 32, my wife and I, mindful of the song and park, named our daughter Shenandoah.  Still later, we learned the meaning of this ancient, Native American word:  “Clear-eye’d Daughter of the Stars.”  That was what they called the river.\r\n  \r\nWhen I was 41, I wrote this Fantasia, paying homage to the beautiful valley, park and tune.  I scored it for string orchestra but since I couldn''t afford to hire a string orchestra to record it, I rescored it for string quartet and recorded that  version on my CD, "Music for the Appalachian Trail," a portion of the profits being donated to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.\r\n\r\nI like the string quartet version but it is thin compared to the richer sound I had in mind, the sound of a full string orchestra.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 60 I heard from an old friend, Tod Addison, now a Major in the US Army, sharing the news that he was soon to become the conductor of the symphony orchestra attached to the US Army Band.  He asked if I had any works for string orchestra!   Yes!  \r\n\r\nI sent him my Fantasia on Shenandoah.  He loved it.  Two years later he conducted the world premiere performance in Washington DC.   You may be sure I was there, in the front row, family in tow.\r\n\r\nBefore the performance, Tod had me give a short speech to the audience, describing how and why I wrote the piece.  Of course, I introduced our daughter, Shenandoah, by name, making her stand up and amaze the crowd with her bright smile and dazzling blond curls!  You can''t miss an opportunity like that!  I suspect she’d have preferred to remain seated but she was a good sport about it.  After the performance, I took a bow and then ate my share of cookies at the reception.  That was a happy day!\r\n\r\nSo I was 62 when I finally heard the piece played the way I had imagined it, exactly 50 years after hearing the song in the film score for “How The West Was Won.".\r\n\r\nIn the world of classical music, everything happens very, very slowly.  But the compensating factor is that the music itself never grows old.  We age, while music remains evergreen, even after hundreds of years, let alone the mere 21 years I had to wait to hear this piece performed.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the concert was recorded and Major Addison kindly sent me an mp3 afterwards.  It is not on a CD.  It exists only as an mp3.

First I remember the ones we visited when I was a boy and later a young man, with my parents, brothers and wives, in the days before our own kids were born:  Zion, Bryce, Grand Tetons, Yellowstone.  And two 8-day canoe expeditions with Boy Scouts in Algonquin Provincial Park.\r\n\r\nThen come the parks Jo and I visited with our children when they were young:  Great Smoky Mountain, Everglades, Yellowstone, Glacier, Yosemite, Kauai (a Hawaiian island, 95% of which is a state park).  \r\n\r\nThen I revisit in my mind’s eye the parks we visited as a couple in our early empty-nester years:  Acadia, Theo. Roosevelt, Badlands, Custer (another state park but the equal of our greatest National Parks), Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Olympia, Mt. Rainier, the Canadian Rockies.  \r\n\r\nThen come the parks we visited later still, with our adult children:  Rocky Mountain, Grand Tetons, Yellowstone yet again and Mesa Verde (one of the best).  \r\n\r\nNext, I dream of the parks we hope to visit yet:  Arches, Canyonlands, Capital Reef, Voyageurs, Isle Royale, the Maritimes.  I say their names out loud and try to envision them.\r\n\r\nWe haven’t traveled only to parks.  We have fond memories of many cities and towns as well -- Manhattan, New Orleans, San Francisco, Québec City, Vancouver, Charleston, Williamsburg, Cape May, the villages of Northwestern CT -- and countries, too -- France, Italy, Austria, Slovenia.  \r\n\r\nBut in this email message I focus on National Parks because my First Aid ritual ends with a visit, in my imagination, to the National Park that has the strongest claim on my affections and that leads to the music I want to share today.  It’s not the most spectacular park; it’s the one I’ve returned to most often and remember most fondly:  the Shenandoah National Park.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the northern third of the park.  The park is 104 miles long; we’ve explored only the northern third.  But in that section, we’ve hiked nearly every trail, seen every waterfall and overlook, spotted black bears, attended Ranger programs and relished the lodges at Skyland and Big Meadows.  We’ve climbed Mary’s Rock a dozen times in the company of various combinations of family and friends, most now long gone.\r\n\r\nOnce only we were lucky enough to be in the S.N.P. when the Mountain Laurel was in full bloom; we hiked for miles through a gorgeous realm, an almost unbelievable display of Nature at her most ravishing.  It was as if the entire region had been readied for a wedding of the gods. \r\n\r\nI wrote my “Fantasia on Shenandoah,” one of my best works, partly with that park in mind.  An old friend of mine, Tod Addison, conducted the world premiere with the US Army Strings in Washington DC in April, 2013.   You may be sure that Jo and I were there, in the front row, family in tow.\r\n\r\nBefore the performance, Tod invited me to give a short speech to the audience, describing how and why I wrote the piece.  I mentioned the park and introduced our daughter, Shenandoah, who is named for the park, asking her to stand up and amaze the crowd with her bright smile and dazzling blond curls!  A proud father cannot miss an opportunity like that!  I suspect she would have preferred to have remained seated but she was a good sport.  After the performance, I took a bow and we ate our fair share of cookies at the reception.  That was another happy day!\r\n\r\nFortunately, the concert was recorded though never issued on a CD.  Few have heard the performance.  You are among a handful who have.  Until two weeks ago, it existed only as an mp3.\r\n\r\nTod Addison, now a Lieutenant Colonel and Commander of the U.S. Military Band at West Point, recently started a youtube channel featuring recordings of performances he has directed, among them the Army Strings’ performance of my Fantasia which has garnered 8 views so far!  Hey, it’s brand new!\r\n\r\nTod asked me for a photo to display on youtube while the music is playing.  I sent him one that Jo took on the overlook atop Hawksbill Mountain in the Shenandoah National Park.  That was yet another happy day.  Be gone, dull care!  \r\n\r\nHere is the link to the video:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tJsj7y4Yqg&t=13s\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the string quartet version of the score for my Fantasia on “Shenandoah,” click the link above.','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),166);

That''s me in the tenor section, the bespectacled guy with a white beard and a long mustache.  \r\n\r\nSinging in that choir, under the direction of Chris Miller, a good friend and an ardent champion of my music, is among the best of the many blessings that flow through my life these days.  Mt. Auburn is a welcoming church; we bring the gifts we have to share.  I''m a composer; that''s my authentic self.  I''ve written fifteen hymns, about two dozen anthems and several solos and duos for use in our services.  I''ve invited musician friends to play my instrumental music there as well.\r\n\r\nAfter a service in which a new anthem of mine had been sung, I was standing by the table on which the coffee hour goodies were spread and a woman asked me, "Was that your piece?"\r\n\r\nI smiled and said yes it was and that I had written it specially for the choir.  Her face went blank so I stumbled forward, saying that the piece had puzzled the choir the first time we rehearsed it, but Chris had persisted, taught it well, pulled it together and in the end we really put it across.\r\n\r\nWhen I paused, she said, "No, I meant was that your piece of coffee cake?

When the eighth-notes are flowing steadily, alto Jane Carter enters with one of my folk-like tunes.  ("Folk-y but not hokey," is how Gregg Smith described my music.)  Next, the flute plays the opening phrase of the famous Doxology tune, also known as Old Hundred.  \r\n\r\nMore singing; the flute comes in again, this time with the second phrase of Old Hundre; more singing, then the flute plays the third phrase, then the fourth.  Finally the choir takes up the Old Hundred tune as the flute plays, in counterpoint, the folk-like tune Jane sang earlier.  \r\n\r\nThe famous Shaker tune, "Simple Gifts" is quoted at the very end.  \r\n\r\nThis recording was made when the choir sang in a concert of my vocal music.  At first, you''ll hear applause (for the piece we''d just sung), then the anthem, then more applause.

But I dearly love my home and I am here with someone I dearly love.  Yesterday, I hit the bike trail, a thing I love to do.  Jo was making the dill bread, so I went alone.  Five miles to Terrace Park, a spin around the village and then five miles back.  It was ’spitting rain,’ as we say in Ohio, so I took off my glasses.  I can see without my glasses; I’m just not sure exactly who are what I am looking at.  Even so, I spotted something in the distance, coming toward me on the trail from the opposite direction, something familiar and attractive — not something! someone! —  riding a bicycle toward me.  Could it be?  Was it her?  No.  She was baking dill bread.  But wait!  It WAS her!  My lady!\r\n\r\nShe’d gotten the bread into the oven and set out on the trail, figuring she would encounter me heading back from Terrace Park.  I was so happy to see her!

A superb graphic artist, he designed my website (see it for yourself:  www.sowash.com) and most of my books and CDs.  He is also a glider pilot, a self-taught classical guitarist, a loving husband and devoted father.  \r\n\r\nHis wife Michele is also a fine graphic artist and the creator of an original and unusual series of Nature books for children.  (See http://www.wrightdesignsbooks.com).  \r\n	 \r\nIn 1993 Randy asked me to compose a suite to be played at his wedding, which was to take place in Cincinnati’s beautiful Mt. Airy Park.  He specified only that it be scored for oboe, violin and cello — because he loves those instruments.  Since Randy particularly admires the music of the Baroque era, I composed the suite mostly in a style that might be termed “American Baroque.”  \r\n\r\nI say “mostly” because the second of the suite''s four movements, entitled “Romance,” is the exception, an antidote to the other three Baroque-ish movements.  As you would expect, the music is ‘romantic’ -- caressing, tender, lyrical.   \r\n\r\nThe oboe has the melody but the other two instruments are never merely accompanying the oboe’s tune, never merely filling out the harmonies.  Instead, they gently tug our attention away from the tune, with wistful little melodies of their own, always in counterpoint to what the oboe is doing.\r\n\r\nA wedding affirms mutual love, a public promise of enduring, mutual support.  I like to think that the strings in this movement are playing their parts in support of the oboe which, by ‘singing’ its lovely tune, provides the very reason why the strings should be playing at all.\r\n\r\nA metaphor for a successful marriage, wouldn’t you say?\r\n\r\nA suggested this:  I had a thought about your Romance:  the violin and cello voices are, indeed, so very important. I decided that they were the voices of the bride and bridegroom (kind of wondering around, a little lost, maybe), and that the oboe was the voice of the life they create together. \r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement, “Romance,” from my Mt. Airy Wedding Suite played by my friends violinist Marion Peraza de Webb, oboist Amy Dennison and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 11, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello and Happy Easter / April Fool’s Day —\r\n\r\nYou’re probably expecting a practical joke.\r\n\r\nInstead of pulling one on you, I’ll share a classic that H. Allen Smith recounts in The Compleat Practical Joker.  If the practical joke could be, by a stretch, regarded as an art form, this surely is a masterpiece\r\n\r\n	“E.A. Sothern, an English actor known for his comic roles, once gave a dinner for a dozen gentlemen, one of whom was late in arriving.  Sothern and the others were at the table when a servant announced the arrival of the tardy one.  “Quick!” ordered the host.  “Everyone get down, and under the table. We’ll give him a good shock!”  All of his guests dropped to the floor and crawled beneath the table.  In walked the latecomer.  “Where is everyone?” he asked.  “Strange thing," answered Sothern.  “The moment they heard your name they all got under the table."\r\n\r\nI’ve been re-reading The Compleat Practical Joker in preparation for a new course I am going to teach next year at “Leaves of Learning,” the imaginatively-named school that has employed me these past four years as a ‘perfesser'' of French, Music Theory & History and The Art of Storytelling.\r\n\r\n“How To Be Funny” will be the name of the course, as listed in the school’s curriculum. \r\n\r\nWhen I tell people the name of the course I like refer to it, with a straight face and a nod to Porky Pig, as …. “How To Be (b’ditt-uh, b’ditt-uh) Funny."\r\n\r\nHere’s the full title and syllabus:\r\n\r\nHow To Be Funny:  A Practical Guide to Making Other People Smile\r\n\r\n-- jokes, puns, wordplay, double talk, malarkey, poppycock, balderdash and twaddle \r\n-- stunts, tricks, gags, practical jokes, high jinks, shenanigans, tomfoolery and monkeyshines\r\n-- funny actual words like rannygazoo, flummery, oompus-boompus, the heebie-jeebies and kerfuffle\r\n-- funny names, like Stan Dupp, Eileen Dover, Plato Beans and Helen Highwater\r\n-- learning to speak apparent gibberish, i.e, ‘code languages’ similar to Pig-Latin\r\n-- legerdemain (sleight-of-hand) for beginners\r\n -- plus Other Things to Say & Do of Which Serious-minded People Will Scarcely Approve\r\n\r\n-- Discovering classic film humor:\r\nLaurel & Hardy, The Marx Bros., Jerry Lewis, Jonathan Winters, Steve Martin, Monty Python\r\n\r\n-- Discovering classic written humor:\r\nPG Wodehouse, Jerome K Jerome, Mark Twain, James Thurber, humorous poems, aphorisms, one-liners, parody, satire, writing our own humorous stories\r\n\r\n-- Discovering musical humor:\r\nGilbert & Sullivan, Spike Jones, Peter Schickele, Jonathan & Darlene Edwards,\r\nfunny songs, novelty numbers, writing our own funny songs\r\n\r\n-- Discovering the uses to which funniness can be put:  to have fun, to amuse friends, to compel people to listen to you, to appeal to potential boyfriends and girlfriends, to shelter yourself from Life’s Trials by habitually seeking the comedic potential in almost every situation, to develop a healthy alternative to the Blues, and to banish dull care with a hey nonny no and a hot cha cha.\r\n\r\n-- Philosophizing throughout on the nature of comedy, i.e, why something is funny\r\n\r\nI’ll have no more than twelve students (the class-size limit imposed by the school), aged between 12 and 17, probably all boys.  There will be thirty-four classes, each seventy-five minutes long.\r\n\r\nI am elated!  Think of it!  To be paid in good green dollars for having this much fun!\r\n\r\nIn last Sunday’s email I mentioned that I’m facing another knee replacement surgery, probably in June.  Planning the exact content of each of those thirty-four classes will give me something immensely entertaining to do with my creative energy during the summer-long recovery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, here is a piece of music that is funny … or at least droll.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Finale movement from my Mt. Airy Suite (written for the wedding ceremony of my dear friend Rand Wright, almost 25 years ago(, played some other friends — violinist Marion Peraza de Webb, oboist Amy Dennison and cellist Ellen Shertzer --, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nA marriage is a fugue-like thing, sometimes joyful, sometimes sombre, a shared commitment to a single notion, just as a fugue commits to a single ’subject.’ \r\n\r\nIn music, a ‘subject’ is the theme upon which the composition is based; in musical forms other than the fugue it would be termed a theme, tune, melody or ditty (a fun-loving little word).\r\n\r\nIn a marriage, the ’subject’ is the audacious notion that a pair of separate, distinct, even opposing entities are voluntarily attempting to form a permanent community of two, a life lived conjointly.\r\n\r\nA fugue begins with one voice sounding the subject.  Like one spouse interrupting the other, in mid-sentence, the subject is now sounded by a second voice, only, in another curious equivalency with marriage, in an opposing key and at no small distance from the key in which the opening statement was sounded — fully a fifth above or below!  In music, that''s no small leap; take it from your Uncle Rick.  \r\n\r\nThe fugue / marriage is just getting started and already, the newlyweds are chuckling, a little nervously.  “Are we having our first argument?"  In what key shall the subject be stated?  Will one key dominate?  That’s the tension, the altercation that propels the fugue, the squabble that makes the marital episode into a story.  \r\n\r\nThat tension proffers the essential narrative tug.  No narrative tug?  No story.  The fugue will be boring, the marriage less-than-lively (one way of putting it!)\r\n\r\nThus, both fugues and marriages come with a gilt-edged guarantee:  unity and conflict will conjoin and pull us along in the process.\r\n\r\nBut now the teacher / storyteller in me must elucidate that abstract assertion with a concrete example.  \r\n\r\nSuppose I say to my wife of forty-six years (this very day is the 46th anniversary of our wedding, July 22, 1972), “Let me make you a nice breakfast!” \r\n\r\nShe will turn from “Meet the Press,” smile and say, “Sure!”\r\n\r\n“Would you like oatmeal with blue-berries, chunks of walnut and a hearty spattering of French vanilla soy milk topped off with freshly ground nutmeg?  Or an omelet  enfolding cream cheese and sautéed garlic?  Or with grated gruyère and chopped dill?  Or ringlets of sharp cheddar with dashes of smoked paprika and Montreal steak seasoning?  Or curry and mushrooms?”\r\n\r\n(The ‘subject’ of this conversational fugue, you see, is the question of precisely which breakfast the loving husband will prepare for his appreciative wife.  Now comes her answer, still on the same ’subject’ but, figuratively, at the distant interval of a fifth.)\r\n\r\n“No mushrooms, please,” she’ll say, "and I don’t think dill would go very well with gruyère."\r\n\r\n“Oatmeal then?”\r\n\r\n“I love oatmeal and they say it’s good for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oatmeal then.”\r\n\r\n(This is called ‘counterpoint’ and/or ‘development’ during which the ‘subject’ is tossed back and forth and elaborated upon.)\r\n\r\nBut then she says, “It’s been a while since I''ve had an omelet and we could toast that good sourdough bread I bought.”\r\n\r\n“OK then, an omelet with garlic and cream cheese?”  \r\n\r\n“What was the other omelet?”\r\n\r\n“Sharp cheddar with smoked paprika and steak seasoning.”\r\n\r\n“But blueberries are awfully good and are supposed to be one of the best foods for you.”\r\n\r\n“Blueberries in an omelet?”\r\n\r\n“You know that’s not what I meant.  On oatmeal, with walnuts, like you said."\r\n\r\n“So, which is it then, oatmeal or an omelet?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nAh, but she does care and my task is to intuit which way she is leaning. \r\n\r\n(The tension builds as the fugue approaches its climax.)\r\n\r\nI settle on oatmeal and bring it to her with a cup of hot, fresh coffee.  “Oh, you made oatmeal,” she says, with a little sigh.  “I thought you were going to make an omelet.”\r\n\r\n“But you said you didn’t care.”\r\n\r\n“Oatmeal will be fine."\r\n\r\n“But I WOULD have made you an omelet!” I assert in a strong, masculine voice.\r\n\r\n“There’s no need to yell.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not yelling!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are.”\r\n\r\n(This is the culmination toward which the counterpoint and development has been  skillfully directed.  Again I say, a marriage is a fugue-like thing.  Now comes the coda, the ending.)  \r\n\r\n“Did you remember to put a little brown sugar in the oatmeal?” she asks before tasting.   \r\n\r\n“I did, Love of my Life.  And you’re welcome.”  \r\n\r\n“Thank you and don’t be a smart aleck."\r\n\r\nUpon reaching its final cadence, a fugue always resolves into the key in which it began.  All those counter-assertions at the interval of a fifth, all that counterpoint and development were, it turns out, beside the point except insofar as the development of the subject IS the point, the whole point, and nothing but the point of a fugue.  \r\n\r\nSo it is with a marriage.  Development is the point.\r\n\r\nIn both forms of expression, the journey eclipses the destination.\r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement, “Fugue,” from my Mt.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(93,replace(replace('Beset by crises, both personal and private, where shall we direct our minds?  \r\n\r\nMy dear wife had major surgery three days ago to repair multiple injuries she suffered in a bad fall.  She is miserable.  She faces many weeks in a cast / sling, followed by at least six long months of physical therapy, trying to heal.  Until healing comes, she’ll be in bad shape.\r\n\r\nMy dreadful president, elected in a bad Fall, daily inflicts multiple injuries on my dear causes, our suffering world.  We are miserable.  We face at least seventeen long months in a figurative cast / sling followed by many years of political therapy, trying to heal.  Until healing comes, we’ll be in bad shape.\r\n\r\nWhen crises beset me, here’s one thing I do:  I sing these words, to a tune of my own devising:  \r\n\r\n			“Be still and know that I am God.”\r\n\r\nIf you want to hear those comforting words sung to that tune right now by the Harvard Univ. Choir, copy and paste this link into your browser:  \r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/be_still.mp3\r\n\r\nAnother thing I sometimes do, when crises loom, is to imagine trees conversing.  \r\n\r\nWhat would they discuss?  The wind, the rain, the sun, the stars and the moon, the squirrels, chipmunks and birds, the passing seasons, the suppleness of their youth, the strength of their maturity, their eventual return to the soil.  Oh, and astonishment at how quickly the little saplings are growing up.\r\n\r\nBut the conversations of trees may be otherwise conceived.  Consider this:  save the flute, brass and percussion, musical instruments are made out of trees.\r\n\r\nThink of it!  Clarinets, cellos and pianos are mostly made of wood that was once, somewhere, a green-leafed, growing tree.  \r\n\r\nWhen ligneous instruments play together, their respective trees of origin share an  audible conversation!\r\n\r\nWhen my trios for clarinet, cello and piano are performed, humans are conversing through the trees from whence their instruments came!  \r\n\r\nThe clarinetist pushes breath past an Arundo donax reed, through a long cone carved from mpingo , African blackwood or grenadilla.  \r\n\r\nThe cellist draws a catgut bow across strings resonated by a shapely, polished box of maple, spruce, boxwood, willow or rosewood.  \r\n\r\nThe pianist directs felt hammers to strike taut strings that ring from the body of an instrument fashioned out of close-grained, quarter-sawn Sitka spruce.\r\n\r\nThink!  Just think!\r\n\r\nOur debt to trees is incalculable.  Music may be the least of the blessings they confer upon us.  The table on which my computer sits as I write these words, the chair upon which I sit, the floor upon which the chair sits — are entirely made of wood.  As are the hiking sticks of our youth and the canes and crutches of our old age.  As are our cradles, our bedposts, our coffins.  \r\n\r\nThe flotsam and jetsam of our lives are mostly made from wood:  pencils, paper sacks, cardboard boxes, matchsticks, trays, salad bowls, picture frames, cupboards, window sills, mopboards, crown moulding, turpentine.  \r\n\r\nWe are nourished and delighted by almonds, walnuts, apples, oranges, lemons, tangerines, maple syrup.\r\n\r\nPerhaps best of all, trees bless us with shade.  What have humans done for trees that they should shelter us with the blessing of shade?\r\n\r\nTrees enrich the very air we breathe, converting our exhalations of carbon dioxide into oxygen suitable for inhalation.  No breath?  No conversation, no singing.  Indeed, no life.  Forgive me for stating the obvious; sometimes the obvious needs to be articulated.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have to feed them; they flourish all by themselves.  Long before we achieved consciousness, trees figured out how to eat sunlight, a comparable achievement.\r\n\r\nDogs are well and good, but the best living allies we have on this planet are trees. \r\n\r\nTheir support is spiritual as well, even philosophical.  Like good parents, they teach us, not by verbal instruction but by noble example.  \r\n\r\n	"It is precisely in growing like a tree that we become ever more fully human -- that is, by solidifying the past into a support and structure for the present, and by adding every year a new ring of growth."\r\n\r\nI wish I could claim to have penned those wise, beautiful words.  I did not.  I plucked that sentence from a dendrophile’s memoir, The Cabin Down the Glen, by Odell Shepard.\r\n\r\nHere''s a bit more of the verbal magic he spins on the subject of trees: \r\n\r\n	“Twilight is falling in the glen.  Hues of pearl and amethyst are thrown back from every rock and twig and bole.  Every leaf reflects a ray from the deepening west.  The boughs where the shadows gather, the layered leaves, and all the expectant multitudes of the fern, are very still.  Once more the trees sink into meditation, groping down that endless road of thought or dream which claims them every night and all the winter long.  So still they are, so breathless, that one might think them carved in jade or painted in a picture.  They seem to be holding their breath to listen.”\r\n\r\nAre you listening?  It’s a moment for music.  Let’s listen to three trees conversing.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the opening movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThere is a relationship, a rapport, between the clarinet and the cello that is unique among pairings of instruments.\r\n\r\nJust as the clarinet is the cello of the wind family, the cello is the clarinet of the string family.\r\n\r\nHearing them separately, you wouldn’t mistake one for the other.  But when just those two instruments play together, the relationship is consummated, a magical blending, the two become almost as one.  \r\n\r\nAs in a good marriage, each diminishes its individual identity in complementing the other; the sum is greater than the parts.  \r\n\r\nOur marriage is like that, to a degree that sometimes startles me, as when I realize that whatever opinion, feeling or reaction “I” might have, if I were merely an individual, is subsumed into the larger opinion, feeling or reaction that “we” have as a couple.\r\n\r\nWhat ‘BigTrips'' shall we venture upon in our remaining years?  If it was up to me alone, I’d go straight back to France.  Why go anywhere else?  But I’ve been there eight times already and Jo doesn’t speak French.  So I give slim odds to the possibility of returning to France, even though it remains my favorite country.  \r\n\r\nInstead I ask what Big Trips “we” would enjoy.  The British Isles, Vancouver Island, Crete, Alaska?  Shall we return to places we’ve discovered together:  Kauai, the Olympic peninsula, Tuscany, Cape May, Cumberland Island?\r\n\r\nThe wishes of “the one” remain dimly formed, easily dismissed, quickly forgotten.  The wishes of “the two” come clear and are eventually realized.\r\n\r\nAs Ovid says in his Metamorphoses, “We two form a multitude.”\r\n\r\nWell, the clarinet and the cello, when they play together, “form a multitude.”  \r\n\r\nOne coupling that forms that multitude is heard when the clarinet plays higher than the cello.  Another is when the cello plays the higher than the clarinet.  \r\n\r\nAnother sound, distinctly different, is when the cello plays its open D and A strings while the clarinet sounds the third of the chord, an F or an F sharp.  The sound is so unexpected that you would think that triad was being played by a third instrument.  \r\n\r\nThink how much the sounds of both those instruments change as they run their respective gamuts from their lowest registers to their highest.  Pair them low, pair them high, surprising new sounds are heard, new feelings evoked.  A multitude indeed.\r\n\r\nThe second movement of my Trio #4 for clarinet, cello and piano is scored for only the clarinet and cello; the piano is silent.\r\n\r\nThe solo clarinet begins, intoning a mysterious tune, pausing between phrases.  Listen carefully to what happens exactly 52 seconds in.  The cello enters and, for a little while, you’d almost think it was a second clarinet.\r\n\r\nFor me, this movement is a nocturne, the instruments susurrant, ‘au fond du bois,’ \r\nYou’ve heard the expression, “Once in a blue moon”?  This music is the once the blue moon is in.  \r\n\r\nAt the end, the two instruments seem to become aware of us, the listeners.  They whisper, "Hush!  We are observed!” … they stop, still as stones ... and as silent.\r\n\r\nAs my Trio #4 aspires to be a colloquy of trees, you’re invited to ponder this movement as a dialogue between the two trees that were harvested, carved and fashioned into this particular clarinet and cello.\r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement of my Trio #4 for clarinet, cello and piano, "Conversation of Trees,” played by clarinetist Laurel Bennett and cellist Teresa Villani, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning, a few years back, our pastor challenged us, mid-sermon, by asking and demanding the following:  \r\n\r\n“What gives you joy?  Turn to your neighbor in the pew — not your spouse or partner, someone else —  and tell them what gives you joy.”  \r\n\r\nI had never asked myself that question so directly but I immediately knew my answer.\r\n\r\n“What gives me joy,” I said to Jim Norman, my octogenarian friend and fellow tenor in the church choir, who happened to be seated next to me, “is making people smile.” \r\n\r\n“What gives me joy,” Jim said, in turn, “is singin'' in the choir, especially when we sing your music.”\r\n\r\nWriting this now, smiling, tears come to my eyes.  Jim is gone; he had a stroke and faded away.  I will remember our exchange for a long time.  It was a supreme compliment.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of prompting smiles, many sorts of smiles.  Wistful smiles, thoughtful smiles, grateful smiles, kindly smiles, even sad smiles.  In my music, my writings and my interactions with people, my aim is to elicit smiles.\r\n\r\nI try to be kind, to ask after others and to listen to their replies.  I’m not very good at it but I do my best.  As someone said, “Be kind because everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.”\r\n\r\nBeing funny is much easier.  I have a good memory and can usually pull out a quip to suit the occasion.\r\n\r\nLast Thursday night our church choir had just stumbled through a difficult piece, reading it for the first time, and I remembered a comment my high school band director made, forty years ago, after a similarly miserable reading.  I quoted it to the choir: “Well, as my high school band director said, you weren’t together but at least you were out of tune.”  It prompted a good laugh.\r\n\r\nWe usually associate humor with verbal wit or sight gags.  But music can be humorous, too.  A humorous piece of music?  What would THAT sound like?  It certainly would not be cast in a minor key, since everyone knows that music in a minor key is SAD.\r\n\r\nOh, really?  Not if it’s exuberantly self-mocking.  Let me give you an example.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the third movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIf you listen to the music I want to share today, please be patient.  \r\n\r\nIt begins darkly.  Gloomily even!  You might say to yourself, “Whoa!  With bad news pounding us from all directions, who needs THIS?”  \r\n\r\nBe patient.  It’s a set-up!  There’s a very big surprise, unmistakbly American, that pops as soon the piano enters, precisely 2 minutes and 27 seconds after the movement begins!\r\n\r\nBut first, a few thoughts ...\r\n\r\nAlmost everything you are likely to hear at a concert of ‘classical’ music in an American concert hall or on an American classical music radio station was written by composers from nations that were, or aspired to be, empires during the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Is it an accident that almost all of the composers we hear performed live or broadcast  just happen to have come from those countries?\r\n\r\nConsider ...\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian empire’s capital was Vienna, in its day the most important city, musically, in the world.  It gave us Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Mahler.\r\n\r\nMy beloved France:  Debussy, Ravel, Saint-Saens, Gounod, Franck, Chopin, Berlioz.    \r\n\r\nRussia:  Tchaikovsky (the most frequently performed of all ‘classical’ composers -- did you know that?), Rimsky-Korsakof, Borodin, Glazounov, Mussorgsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Stravinsky.  \r\n\r\nGreat Britain:  Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Finzi, Britten.\r\n\r\nThe little countries around the edges of these Great Powers are, seemingly, each allowed one or two ‘great’ composers.  None of them are performed as frequently as the Big Names from the Imperial countries.  \r\n\r\nFinland?  Sibelius.\r\n\r\nNorway?  Grieg.\r\n\r\nDenmark?  Nielsen.\r\n\r\nSpain?  de Falla.  Maybe Granados.\r\n\r\nThe former Czechoslovakia?  Dvorak and Smetana.\r\n\r\nItaly?  Verdi and Puccini.\r\n\r\nI know a thing or two about music but I cannot name a single composer from Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg.  I cannot name a single composer from the Western Hemisphere (unless they are from my own country, of course).  Nor from Africa, Asia or Oceania.  How many composers from those continents can you name?  Not one?  Me neither.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?  I think it’s because there is a consensus among American conductors, musicians, radio program directors and academics -- and, yes, listeners -- that, when it comes to ‘high culture,’ we train a colonial mentality by accepting the notion that the old imperial European powers “really know” and that we, out here in their former colonies, must bow to their judgment.\r\n\r\nHow does America fit into this scenario?  We have exported our pop music but relatively little ‘classical’ music.  My French musician friends know Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” and Bernstein’s “Candide Overture” and that’s about it.  Name Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Virgil Thomson, Randall Thompson, Roy Harris, Ferde Grofé or Charles Ives and they shake their heads.\r\n\r\nWe’ve exported plenty of pop culture, to be sure.  Hollywood, Elvis Presley, Rock, Jazz.  Some of it is good stuff, some of it is tripe.  But I have often been surprised by how little my French friends know about ‘serious’ American artists.  One friend, a very bright woman, a retired teacher, assured me that she had never heard of Mark Twain or "Huckleberry Finn."  I began to quiz her, trying to discern what she knew about ‘serious’ American artists.  She knew “Whistler’s Mother,” having seen it in the Musée d’Orsay, but she had no knowledge of “American Gothic.”  She knew about Hemingway and Gertrude Stein, since they had lived in and written about Paris, but knew nothing of Emerson or Thoreau, Melville or Hawthorne.  She had heard the name “Walt Whitman” but had read nothing he’d written.\r\n\r\nLet’s return to music.  Are we to believe that compositional genius just happens to be limited to countries with imperial ambitions?  Really?  Can there be no great composers of ‘concert music'' from, say, Trinidad, Taiwain, Crete, Iceland, Viet Nam, Croatia, Corsica or … dare I say it?  Ohio?\r\n\r\nConlusion:  classical music appears to be rigged, a word we often hear nowadays.\r\n\r\nHow shall an American composer respond?\r\n\r\nWe could imitate the Great European Masters.  Been tried and it don’t work (sic).\r\n\r\nOr we could simply BE American and let the chips fall.  That’s the case with the music I want to share with you today, a gumbo no European could have concocted.  \r\n\r\nThat’s why I made bold to say, at the beginning of this message, that the music I want to share today boasts an unmistakably AMERICAN surprise at precisely 2:27.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the fourth movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click here:\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nBack in August, when I shared the first movement of my clarinet-cello-piano trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” with y''all I received a flurry of responses.  \r\n\r\nMany of you were intrigued with the idea of trees conversing.  Several of the musicians among you kindly requested that I send PDFs of the full score and parts and mp3s of all five movements, which I am very glad to do for anyone who is interested, and for free.  My gift.\r\n\r\nIt is my policy nowadays to give away my life’s work to the greatest extent possible.\r\n\r\nIn selecting music to share in these weekly emails, I usually bounce around among my works, varying the offerings between vocal and instrumental works, light and serious works, long and short movements.  But when y’all seemed enthusiastic about the first movement of “Conversation of the Trees,” I decided to share the remaining four movements over the following six or seven weeks.\r\n\r\nToday I want to share the Finale of “Conversation of the Trees."\r\n\r\nThe Finale aspires to convey the perky parlance of slender trees, to wit, birches,  poplars and the like.  The music strikes me as being simultaneously Bach-ish and American-sounding, another of the quirky confluences that are everywhere in this work.  \r\n\r\nThese trees are smiling as they converse and I hope that you will be smiling, too, as you listen.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the fifth movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nIn France, truly, time is not spent, saved or wasted.  It is not invested or budgeted, not something one has or gives.  The French don’t say that a flat tire cost them an hour or that someone is living on borrowed time.  Time isn’t something they can use profitably or might run out of.  \r\n\r\n“Time is money” is American.  In France, time passes, only passes.  Like gravity or air, in France time simply is.\r\n\r\nAn American finds this, initially, a little bewildering.  When I’ve finished my meal and am eager to get back to exploring Paris, why on earth does it take so long for the waiter to bring “l’addition?”  More than once, I’ve had to rise from my seat, put on my hat and ostentatiously head for the door in order to induce the waiter to come running after me -- finally! -- with ‘the tab.’\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of weeks in France, the psychic muscles that audit my expenditure of time begin to unclench.  I gradually remember how to relax and let events unfold at a pace not of my choosing.\r\n\r\n“Shall we attend a ”cirque” tonight?” asked my friend Sylvie, in French, correctly using the subjunctive.  A retired teacher of French, the equivalent of what we term “an English teacher,” Sylvie insisted that we speak only French in her home, where I was a guest.  She and her son, Vincent, 12-years old at the time, instructed and corrected me as we conversed, a joyous and effective way to improve one’s foreign language skills.\r\n\r\n“Bien sûr!” I replied.  Being American, I imagined we would be seeing a “circus” with a ringmaster, clowns, trained elephants, dogs doing tricks, bareback riders, a tiger or a lion, trapeze artists, a brass band.  You know the scene.\r\n\r\nWrong.  A “cirque” is a very different spectacle, more ballet than circus.  If you’ve seen or heard about the “Cirque du Soleil,” you know.  Acrobats and music, yes, but far different than Barnum & Bailey. \r\n\r\nSylvie, Vincent and I arrived at the theatre about a quarter hour in advance of showtime and bought our tickets at the box office through a window opening onto the sidewalk.  A crowd of perhaps 250 was standing about, waiting for the doors to open.  I thought it a little odd that the doors would still be shut, fifteen minutes prior to showtime.\r\n\r\nDid I ever mention?  Back in 1980, I rescued, almost single-handedly, an historic 1500-seat movie palace -- the Renaissance Theatre --  built in 1925 in Mansfield, Ohio.  It barely escaped the wrecking ball.  During the six subsequent years, I served as the theatre’s Executive Director, managing operations.  When we presented a show at “the Ren,” the doors opened at least a half hour in advance.  People would gather in the lobby, buy concessions, visit and chat, waiting for the show to begin.  Show-goers were never made to wait on the sidewalk.  \r\n\r\nAn American crowd, denied entrance to a theatre fifteen minutes in advance of showtime would be restive.\r\n\r\nBut here we were, 250 French people, showing no signs of restiveness.  We waited and waited.  Showtime came and went.  Nothing.  I heard not a murmur of discontent.\r\n\r\nBy ten after, an American crowd would be furious at this waste of precious time.  Having gone to all the trouble of preparing an early supper, driving downtown, finding a parking spot and arriving well ahead of showtime, they would be bitterly resentful to discover that the show was not beginning on time.  In another ten minutes, they would be pounding on the doors, some of them demanding a refund.  Making them wait any longer than that, with no explanation, could spark an insurrection.\r\n\r\nAt 20 minutes past showtime, the door opened and a costumed performer emerged and stood looking at us, waiting until he had our attention.  In his rapid explanation, I caught the phrase “difficultés techniques.”  Sylvie filled in the blanks:  he was announcing that the show would be delayed by another 40 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nIf, as theatre manager, I had made an American crowd wait that long and then delivered that explanation, the women would gasp and wag their forefingers, the men would shout and shake their fists. \r\n\r\nHow did the French crowd react?  They all seemed to react just as Sylvie did.  After making the famous ‘French shrug,’ she suggested we set out in search of ice cream.  Everyone else seemed to have a similar idea.  The crowd quietly and, as best I could judge, contentedly set off in various directions.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely believe it.  I shared my astonishment with Sylvie and she laughed it off.  “Ce n’est pas grave,” she said.  French for “No big deal.”   \r\n\r\n“But you are the people who tore down the Bastille!” I said.  Seeing I was serious, she and Vincent laughed and shook their heads.  “C’était différent!”\r\n\r\nWe found an ice cream parlor, made our purchase and sauntered back to the theatre where the crowd was gathering again.  We all stood and chatted, relaxed and happy.  Time was neither spent, saved or wasted.  It simply was.  Like gravity or air.\r\n\r\nAn hour after the advertised showtime, the doors opened and the crowd entered.  The show was fabulous though I found the death-defying acrobatic stunts unsettling.  Again and again the performers came within inches of being permanently maimed.  Their narrow misses were almost as astonishing to me as the crowd’s passivity during the pre-show delay.\r\n\r\nWe got back to Sylvie’s house an hour later than we had thought we would. \r\n\r\nSo what?  We’d chatted happiy together, enjoyed delicious French ice cream and seen a great show.  The events of the evening had not transpired in the time frame we had anticipated but … “Ce n’est pas grave.”\r\n\r\nTo hear the leisurely first movement of my Trio #4 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Conversation of the Trees,” written for my friends, the French musicians who call themselves “les Gavottes”:  clarinetist Lucien Aubert, cellist François Adlof and pianist Jean Tatu, click on the link above.   \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),75);

The task is repetitive; pickets are identical.  Yet the undertaking was exciting and satisfying; the fence delineated our tiny estate, rendering it charmingly, cheerily old-fashioned.  \r\n\r\nLike our picket fence, this music takes its shape from the repetition of a very simple motive:  up a half step, down a half step, nothing more.  A musical triangle, like the top end of a picket. \r\n\r\nThe little motif finds its way through a series of episodes, just as the our fence zig-zagged along the edges and corners of our little yard, punctuated by three gates.  \r\n\r\nThis piece was originally scored for oboe and strings but I re-scored it for violin, oboe and piano in 2010 because I felt that the piece’s quartal harmonies would sound better on the piano than they do in the strings. \r\n\r\nJust to be sure I’m not losing you here … a ‘quartal’ chord is built out of notes that are a fourth apart, i.e., four steps apart from each other on a musical scale.  Triadic chords are more usual, and are built out of thirds, i.e. notes that are three steps apart.  Strings are made to play triads and they resonate best when the music is triadic.  Pianos, contrariwise, can play any combination of notes without altering the instrument’s resonance.\r\n\r\nGrowing up as a kid who played the piano, which sounds equally good in any key, I didn’t realize that stringed instruments actually sound better in some keys than others.  That’s why so many classical string works are written in D major or A major.  String players are happiest performing music written in those keys because those keys make their instruments sound rich, bright, fulsome.\r\n\r\nI learned this trick the hard way.  When I was about 30, I wrote a piece for violin in A flat major.  In rehearsal, the violinist showed me how much better it would have sounded if I had written it a half step higher, in A major.  He played it for me in both keys and I was amazed at the difference.  \r\n\r\nWhy hadn’t anyone told me this until then?  It’s a great example of the innumerable little tricks composers pick up along the way.  All our lives, we’re learning.  \r\n\r\nTo hear Picket Fence played by oboist Amy Dennison, violinist Marion Peraza de Webb  and pianist Naoko Tanaka, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.  \r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),47);

Devising these dispatches, I don’t dilly-dally.  I don''t pussyfoot around.  I open a tin of smoked oysters, put my cards on the table and talk turkey.\r\n\r\nI’m serious about them!  — especially the funny ones.  You see, "the funny stuff,” as my fan put it, is difficult to pull off.  \r\n\r\nWhen the great British actor David Garrick was on his deathbed, someone asked him, “Is dying hard, Mr. Garrick?”  His immortal reply:  “Dying is easy.  Comedy is hard.”\r\n\r\nHard, even dangerous.  A crash helmet is advisable.  A hard hat, a football helmet or that curious, padded headgear favored by boxers.\r\n\r\nPartly, the risk lies in the possibility of making a durned fool of yourself, as when something you think is funny strikes someone else as being just plain dumb, dumb as a box of rocks.  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a county commissioner, the county’s budget included funds that were encumbered and other funds that were unencumbered.  I suggested that we should have some funds that were cucumbered so that we’d have money to spend if we ever found ourselves in a pickle.  The other commissioners just looked at me.  \r\n\r\nThat moment may well have marked the beginning of the end of my political career.  It was, in any case, the start of what has proven to be, so far, a significant detour on my road to the White House.\r\n\r\nYou’ve been there.  You tell a joke and it falls flat, garners groans, elicits eye rolls.\r\n\r\nTo wit:  \r\n\r\n	They was this old, old lady, a hunnerd years old she was, an’ it was her birthday an’ the reporters come round to make a fuss an’ all, and to congradyulade her on her longevity an’ good health.  \r\n\r\n	“Was you ever ill?” they assed her. \r\n\r\n	“Ah don’t jus’ hear so good,” she says. \r\n\r\n	“WAS YOU EVER ILL?” they assed her agin, more louder.  \r\n\r\n	“Ah’m terrible sorry, but I don’t jus’ hear so good.”  \r\n  \r\n	So then they assed her, “Well, was you ever BEDRIDDEN?” \r\n\r\n	“Oh,” she says, "hunnerds uh times -- an’ twice in a buggy!”\r\n\r\nYour auditors might slap their knees and declare it the funniest thing to come along since Mark Twain teamed up with Samuel Clemens.  \r\n\r\nOr they might just look at you.  \r\n\r\nShould a joke like that one fall within the earshot of a person beset with delicate sensibilities, it could induce what modern-day nerve specialists term ‘a conniption fit.''\r\n\r\nAnother thing you risk is an exponential increase to your already sizable store of regrets.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a twenty-something classical music radio broadcaster i sometimes said things on-the-air that, today, when I remember them, give me the Willies.  \r\n\r\n		“In the next hour, music by Dvorak and Smetana.  Czech it out.”  \r\n\r\nJeesh.  Did I really say that?  Squirm, shudder, cringe.  Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nOh well.  We were all young and foolish, once upon a time, and thought we were a whole lot more clever than we actually were.\r\n\r\nLet’s hear some funny music.

Can we advise one another, you and me?\r\n\r\nWhen I ask a librarian for advice, they sensibly ask in turn, “What books do you like?"\r\n\r\nThe books I like are well written;  the content needn’t always be deep.  \r\n\r\nA case in point:  here is P.G. Wodehouse, virtuoso-ing mirth out of the seemingly mirthless word, “someone” ...\r\n\r\n	"It made such a difference to someone, he explained, if someone had someone someone could sort of lean on at times like this.  Maudie said she quite understood.”\r\n\r\n“...someone someone…”  Ha!  At first, I thought it was a typo; I had to read it twice.\r\n\r\nI want to feel that I am addressed by someone someone can care about.  Writing so well, P.G. compels me to care about his characters, however "visibly fizzy” they may be.  \r\nThe subject matter needn''t be hoot-worthy.  P.G. often wrote about golf.  Golf is not unmeaningless to me but he writes so well that I am happy to be his caddy, traipsing in his tracks as he swings his inventive prose, every sentence a hole-in-one.  The man is both funny and eloquent.  \r\n\r\nI want writing that offers some wit and some wisdom.  I want to feel that pains have been taken in the expression of said wit and wisdom.  I want writing that makes me feel that I have worth, that I am respected, that a contract has been entered into, between the writer and myself, to the effect that if I give the writing my careful attention, my effort will be rewarded.  \r\n\r\nI want to feel that the writer cares about me, just as I care about you, gentle reader of my Sunday-morning e-pistles, giving you my best, musically and lingually.\r\n\r\nWhat books, then, shall we read this year, you and I?  Let''s swap suggestions.  \r\n\r\nHere are some books I love:\r\n\r\n"Three Men in a Boat, to Say Nothing of the Dog" by Jerome K. Jerome — a comic account of a week-long boating journey on the Thames, undertaken by Jerome, his friends George and Harris and his dog, Montmorency.\r\n\r\n“The Harvest of a Quiet Eye” by Odell Shepard — a chronicle, with many digressions, of the author’s two-week walking journey through rural Connecticut in September of 1926.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Dogbody’s Leg” by James Norman Hall — ten highly improbable, hilarious accounts, each completely different from the rest, of how Dr. Fedal Dogbody, a naval surgeon during the Napoleonic Wars, came to lose his leg.\r\n\r\n“The Wind in the Willows” by Kenneth Grahame — the adventures of Toad and the loving interventions of his steadfast friends:  Water Rat, Mole and Badger.\r\n\r\nThe best of Willa Cather — “My Antonia,” “O Pioneers,” “Death Comes for the Archbishop,” “The Professor’s House,” and, best of all, her novella entitled “Neighbor Rossicky.”\r\n\r\n“The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien — Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, et al.  I’ve read it seven times, the funnest being when I read the whole saga aloud to my seven-year-old son.  It took us seven months.\r\n\r\nThe Sherlock Holmes novels and stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.  No description or explanation is needed.\r\n\r\n“The Code of the Woosters,” “Uncle Fred in the Springtime,” and many more by P.G. Wodehouse.\r\n\r\n“War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina” by Leo Tolstoy — I’ve read ‘em both, three times.  If anyone should ask me, “After Shakespeare, who?” I would answer:  Tolstoy, the second greatest writer of all time.  His knowledge of and empathy for people is second only to Shakespeare''s.  If God wrote novels, they would be “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina."\r\n\r\nNone of these titles are contemporary.  \r\n\r\nGo figure.  Here I am, a contemporary composer, yet I steer clear of contemporary music, art and books.  I almost never feel happy in their presence.  New books, particularly novels, are almost always tainted by ugliness and vulgarity; they  entangle the reader in situations that are morbid and degrading; they read like badly written film scripts; the characters have names but little personality; they converse but their voices are indistinguishable; they do not come to life and I cannot care about them.\r\n\r\nI want to be uplifted and inspired by what I read.  At least some of the time, I want to laugh.  \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nI may be a contemporary composer, but my music looks backward.  Never moreso than in my Trio #5 for clarinet, cello and piano.  Deliberately, I wrote it "in the classical style” (that’s the subtitle) perfected long since by Franz Schubert & Company.  \r\n\r\nVery old-fashioned!\r\n\r\nTo hear the first movement played by Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nEach of us dwells in a box which we mistake for Reality, The Real World.  We know how things work inside that box;  we know the ‘givens,’ the established facts and situations, the things that are assumed to be true.\r\n\r\nStill, when Hamlet tells his friend, "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” we sense that he could say as much to each of us and he would be right.  We are taken aback, chilled.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then circumstances prompt us to reach our hands up as far as they will go, curl our fingers over the edge of our little box and hoist ourselves up to where we can peek out and perceive a bit of the Great Beyond, things not dreamt of in our philosophy.  \r\n\r\nFor example, here’s a ‘given,’ an established fact that anyone with common sense knows to be true:  "Music is the universal language.”\r\n\r\nI must have been in my early teens when I first heard that truism.  I bought it.  It made sense.  Humans may speak in various tongues but music communicates universally.\r\n\r\nMusic-making is universal, certainly.  Every culture makes music.  But a universal language?  No.  Nowadays, when that assertion is made I remember an experience which, for me, turned that ‘given’ on its head.\r\n\r\nDuring one of my visits to Taiwan, as leader of a cultural exchange delegation, my Taiwanese hosts kindly asked to know my ‘special interests.’  I mentioned music and chamber music in particular.  My interpreter asked me to define “chamber music” and then translated what I had said for my hosts.  One of them lit up.  I could see by his face that he had an idea, an inspiration.  (Facial expressions may well be a universal language.)\r\n\r\nHe explained that he knew of an extraordinary opportunity for me to hear the most heartfelt, impassioned and intimate chamber music, that very evening.  He would inquire, handle the details, set everything up for me to attend a unique and memorable performance.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, my interpreter and I were taxied through the city.  I assumed we were heading for a recital hall but looking through the windows I saw that we were leaving the city; the areas through which we passed were residential.  At length we stopped in front of a modest home.  We entered and were warmly greeted by an older woman, white-haired, smiling, clad in colorful, elaborate, traditional Chinese garb.\r\n\r\nShe directed us to a living room where there were many chairs surrounding a table on which was displayed, amidst fruits and flowers, a black-and-white photograph of an elderly Chinese man holding a curious musical instrument.  It was explained to me that the man in the photo was the late husband of our hostess and that he had been a great musician.  This evening''s concert, in what had been his home, was being given in his honor and memory by the musician friends with whom he had performed for many years.\r\n\r\nAs the room filled with friends and family, my interpreter explained to me, the only Westerner in attendance, that a Chinese Emperor who lived in the 7th century had cherished this particular variety of chamber music, had been a musician himself, and that this performing group was dedicated to keeping alive this ancient musical tradition.  “This should be interesting,” I thought, “seein'' as how music is the universal language, after all.”\r\n\r\nThe musicians took their places at the front of the room, five elderly gentleman, carrying strange-looking instruments — a three-stringed offspring of a viol da gamba mated with a banjo, shirttail relatives of the oboe and clarinet, plus various others to whose shapes and sounds I had never been introduced.  The audience applauded as the aged instrumentalists seated themselves, joined by a younger female, carrying wooden percussion instruments.  She remained standing.  My interpreter explained:  she was to be the vocalist.\r\n\r\nThe audience fell silent.  The musicians drew a breath, all together, then performed.\r\n\r\nTheir high seriousness, heartfelt passion and fervent devotion to their art were powerfully conveyed by the expressions on their faces.  I had seen such expressions before, on the faces of impassioned American and European musicians, playing string quartets or piano trios.  No doubt about it, the musicians were deeply engaged in what they were doing, the audience spellbound.\r\n\r\nThe music itself?  Excruciating.  Hideous.  It was shrill, a racket.  It made no sense whatever.  Quarter tones abounded.  I judged the meter to be 7 / 4 because the vocalist, I noticed, would smack her wooden percussion instrument as hard as she could every seventh beat, so that the accent was always, maddeningly, on the pick-up, never on the downbeat.  The scraping bows, the piercing reeds, the caterwauling Chinese lyrics, screeched and howled, albeit with obvious deep feeling, made the experience, for me, positively grueling.\r\n\r\nMind you, I’m no novice.  Have I not in my day heard some awful music?  \r\n\r\n“Have I not in my time heard lions roar?  \r\nHave I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds, \r\nRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?  \r\nHave I not heard great ordnance in the field \r\nAnd heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?"\r\n\r\nI have been present when our own culture''s contemporary avant garde composers held sway, inflicting many a “bleep-gazorp” on a bewildered and uncomprehending audience with their “modern music,” which a friend terms:  “terrorism for the ears.”  \r\n\r\nThat long, long evening of traditional Chinese chamber music was, compared with our wildest Western avant garde music, far, far more difficult to bear.  However wild our avant garde music may be, it still exists within the limits of our own musical culture and is generally played on instruments we recognize.\r\n\r\nAs soon as that concert of 7th-century Chinese chamber music began, all I could think was, “Let me out of here!”  But I was a ''special guest'' and could not leave.  I thought the evening would never end.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing universal about the music.  It was utterly incomprehensible to me, a person with what I had imagined to be rather highly developed musical sensibilities … but nevertheless a Westerner.  \r\n\r\nIt made me realize that music only seems universal to the culture it serves; it is, in fact, very particular to a given time and place, quite the opposite of universal.\r\n\r\nOf course I applauded and afterwards congratulated the musicians and thanked the hostess.  What a relief it was, at length, to be back in the taxi, heading back to my hotel.  Though I was still in Taiwan, a culture very alien to my own, I felt that I had returned to Earth from a distant planet where I had understood nothing about what had been going on around me.  My interpreter was silent, inscrutable.  She must have known that the music had been agonizing for me,  painfully far beyond my ability to comprehend. \r\n\r\nWithin the narrow world of Western classical music, yes, there is a certain universality.  I tapped into the core of it, evoking the Viennese tradition that gave us Beethoven and Schubert, when I wrote my Trio #5 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “in the classical style.”  \r\n\r\nHere it is, then, music communicating in a language that inheritors of Western Civilization, dwelling in the little boxes we mistake for Reality, have pronounced “universal."\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement of my Trio #5 “in the classical style" played by Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inauguration elicited feelings of pride and relief.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I’m relieved that it was Biden, not me.  With Atlanta’s mayor as my running mate, ours would have been the “Sowash-Bottoms” ticket.   \r\n\r\nOur slogan?  “Make a Clean Start!”  \r\n\r\nWe could have sold a ton of red ball caps with “MACS” emblazoned on them.  We could have called our major donors “Big MACS.”\r\n\r\nStill, I’m glad I didn’t throw my hat in the ring.  The White House is no place for a composer and I love my home and garden.\r\n\r\nSome say thinkers can’t be do-ers, that philosophers are incapable of worldly success.\r\n\r\nThey forget Thales, an ancient Greek philosopher who, upon hearing it said that philosophers were nonuseful, resolved to prove ‘em wrong.  \r\n\r\nA close observer of the passing seasons, Thales’ meteorogical skills tipped him off, while it was yet winter, that the following autumn would bring a bumper crop of olives.  Bumming coins from his friends, he made deposits guaranteeing him the exclusive use of all the olive presses in Athens, getting them at a very low price as there were no other bidders.  Who needs olive presses in the bleak mid-winter, when frosty wind makes moan?\r\n\r\nCome harvest-time, all the presses were needed at once.  Thales let them out at any rate he pleased, repaid his friends and made a quantity of money.  Thus, he demonstrated that philosophers could enrich themselves if they so chose.  It’s just that that philosophy seemed a worthier investment of time and energy.\r\n\r\nComposers?  Same thing.  If some contemporary composers write music in a modern style, it’s not because they are incapable of writing traditional classical music.  They could, if they so chose.\r\n\r\nThales-like, I set out to demonstrate this by writing my Trio #5 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “in the classical style.”\r\n\r\nThe first movement makes obsequious use of the traditional sonata allegro form that shaped the opening movements of countless works during music’s classical era.  \r\n\r\nYou know the drill:  Exposition, Development, Recapitulation. \r\n\r\nThe music is solidly, stolidly in the key of G minor.  It opens with an aggressive ‘first theme’ (there is no introduction) built on a three-note motif with a masculine character:  jerky and aggressive. \r\n\r\nThe ‘second theme’ enters right on cue at :37.  It is in the key of B flat major and has a feminine character:  flowing and lyrical.  Very traditional.  \r\n\r\n(Masculine?  Feminine?  Sexist terms!  Don’t blame me.  I didn’t invent the sonata allegro form.  I merely made use of it.)  \r\n\r\nThe cello presents the second theme; then the clarinet enters with a flourish and takes it up in turn.  I even utilize the famous “Alberti bass” in the piano accompaniment, the musical filigree frequently favored by Mozart.  So much for the Exposition.\r\n\r\nThe Development begins at 1:40.  Playing strictly by the rules, the two themes -- masculine and feminine -- now intermingle.  Fragments from both themes are tossed “here, there and thither” (as Oliver Hardy said).  It’s not clear what key we are in as the music tentatively finds its way forward.  The Development section ends with a big build up on the dominant seventh, a D7 chord, pointing the way back to good old G minor, the key in which the movement began and must end.\r\n\r\nAt 2:50 comes the Recapitulation, right on schedule.  We hear again our old friend, the first theme, played just as it was at the beginning of the movement.\r\n\r\nIt’s followed, of course, by -- what else? -- the second theme, complete with Alberti bass, at 3:30 — only THIS time the second theme is ALSO in G minor.  It has to be; that’s the rules of the game when using the sonata allegro form.  \r\n\r\nThe first theme returns one last time with just a little more development, while remaining firmly in G minor.  There is no coda.  Introductions and codas are optional.  I chose not to use either.  Keep it simple, that’s my motto.  The movement simply ends.\r\n\r\nThough cast in a minor key, this music seems humorous to me because the composer (me) is earnest to a fault.  How precisely he obeys the rules!  No risk-taker, he!  Conformist, he is smugly satisfied, bless his tiny soul.  You want to pat him on the head.\r\n\r\nHe reminds me of young Stivings, Jerome K. Jerome’s schoolmate, whom he recalled in “Three Men in a Boat”:\r\n\r\n	“He was the most extraordinary lad I ever came across.  I believe he really liked studying.  He used to get into awful rows for sitting up in bed and reading Greek; and as for French irregular verbs there was simply no keeping him away from them.  \r\n	“He was full of weird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and an honor to the school; and he yearned to win prizes, and grow up and be a clever man, and had all those sorts of weak-minded ideas.  I never knew such a strange creature, yet harmless, mind you, as the babe unborn.”\r\n\r\nTo enjoy the first movement being played with relish by Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),52);

The fugue subject happily chugs along, developing as it goes, evoking the fair’s vendors offering their wares to the crowd.\r\n\r\nAt 4:17 the piano takes up the philosopher’s hymn tune while the other two instruments interrupt it at the end of every phrase, playing fragments of the country fair music.\r\n\r\nThus, the two opposing musics are juxtaposed, cheek by jowl, with the reconciliation  completed at 5:15.  \r\n\r\nAfter that, the only thing left to do is to play a coda, wrapping up the anecdote with the ‘moral’ of the story.  The coda start snappily enough, but listen and you’ll hear that the philosopher gets the last word; the work ends with a final nod to the hymn as Diogenes observes:\r\n	 “Lord, how many things are there in this world of which Diogenes hath no need!”   \r\n\r\nHarrumph!\r\n\r\nTo hear the Trio #7 “The Philosopher Visits a Country Fair" played by Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),49);

I can examine the her face, sensing the emotions behind the words.  Too, my view is unobstructed by the backs of the heads of my fellow congregants who, if I seated myself halfway back, would be on display in the pews in front of me.\r\n\r\nI honor and respect my pastor.  By sitting in the front row, I’m gifting her with an audience that is, for her, immediate, tangible, intimate.  Having given thousands of talks over fifty years, I know that an audience assists and supports a speaker when seated in close proximity.  Contrariwise, a speaker is hampered by a physically distant audience.\r\n\r\nWhen, arriving at a venue where I am to give a talk, I find that the meeting planners have failed to grasp the primacy of proximity, arranging the event so that the nearest auditors are twenty five or thirty feet distant from my podium, I abandon the podium and, microphone in hand, advance upon my listeners, planting myself about eight feet in front of the foremost row.\r\n\r\nImagine yourself in the role of a speaker.  Would you feel more comfortable speaking to friends clustering round a dinner table, a living room, a campfire?  Or would you prefer to be isolated, distant, removed from your listeners, a little puppet pontificating beneath a far removed proscenium?\r\n\r\nI suppose your answer might vary depending upon the content of what you hoped to communicate.  You might want to be close up for intimate sharing, distant for dispassionate instruction.\r\n\r\nSermons always interest me.  There’s so much going on.  Out of their own experience of life, someone is attempting to convey wisdom by explicating an ancient text.  All of our regular pastors have been gifted speakers but even when our interim or guest pastors offered sermons that verge on the turgid, I’m interested because I try to analyze precisely what they are doing wrong, where they are going astray.  A sermon, even one that fails to rivet, can teach us much.\r\n\r\nWhen I’m struck by a phrase in a sermon, I jot it down on my copy of the church bulletin for that Sunday.  I show these to Jo when I get home (Jo is not church-y) and sometimes I set them to music.\r\n\r\nThat’s what I did with three aphorisms uttered in separate sermons by our former pastor, Steve Van Kuiken.\r\n\r\nHere they are:\r\n\r\n“We are all made from the ashes of dead stars.”\r\n\r\nThat is, the particles of carbon comprising our bodies’ bulk were once found among an unimaginable number of other carbon particles, comprising an ancient star.  The star burned out, the carbon was released and eventually reassembled into … us!  And where will those particles go after we are disassembled?  Stars, as yet unborn.  Matter being indestructible, “such stuff as we are made on" is  eternal.  Now there’s a thought! \r\n\r\nAnother time, Steve said:\r\n\r\n“The important question is not who you are.  The important question is who you are becoming.”\r\n\r\nLike the carbon comprising our bodies, our true selves are also in the processing of becoming …. what?  Well, that’s the important question, isn’t it?  What is the trajectory of all our wanderings, individually and collectively as the human race?  Another thought well worth pondering!\r\n\r\nSteve often said, \r\n\r\n“We are all on a journey and none of us have arrived.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a humble admission that the preacher is no more qualified to pronounce upon the Eternal Verities than any of the rest of us.  I make a point of quoting this line to my students.  They are learning, hopefully, but so am I.  We’re journeying together.\r\n\r\nThen one day (as storytellers say), I realized that these three aphorisms, taken together, sung one after the next, might make a powerful anthem  In 2001 I set to music these thoughts of Steve’s and we sang the anthem while he was still our pastor.  A few weeks ago, two pastors later, we sang it again.\r\n\r\nIt’s a challenging piece.  Mastering it was difficult.  But we nailed it in the end, thanks to the persistence and skill of our beloved Minister of Music, Chris Miller.  \r\n\r\nIt’s been performed only twice, heard only by the congregants who were gathered in the pews at Mt.

The slabs often feature fossils of the little shell-dwellers who called this region home, millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nMillions of years later, eager to adorn our courtyard — our precious green space in the heart of the city (see photo below) — with standing flower beds, I clambered up and down those hillsides, dodging the poison ivy, and lugged scores of slabs to my pick-up truck, drove ‘em home and arranged ''em into knee-high walls.  I lay the slabs with the richest displays of fossils on the topmost layer of the walls, so that the fossils could be seen and enjoyed.  \r\n\r\nEnjoyed by whom?  Me.  I love looking at them.  They are shapely, translucent; none larger than the circle we make by touching forefinger to thumb.  They prompt me to ponder the lives of those ancient shellfish, so brief, simple and circumscribed.\r\n\r\nWhat did those shellfish do with what little energy they possessed?  What did they figure out about the universe?  The answers are not arcane.  They ate, grew, bred and died.  They knew the Great Opposites:  light and dark, hungry and full, alive and dead.  \r\n\r\nNothing of them remains.  The fossils are not their shells; their shells are long gone. The fossils are merely impressions of their shells, petrified, cast in rock.\r\n\r\nThe 12th century wise man known as Guigo the Carthusian conceived of the ceaseless unfolding of the Universe as a great song perpetually sung by what he called The Wisest Singer.  Guigo observed how each and every entity of the universe clings tenaciously to the single brief syllable of that song during which it exists.\r\n\r\nA generation after Guigo, St. Francis preached to the birds of Tuscany.  Had Guigo been inclined to admonish the Carthusian shellfish, cousins of those creatures whose fossils adorn my stone walls, he would doubtless have used the same words he imparted to us, his fellow humans:  \r\n\r\n	"You have been clinging to one syllable of a great song,” he would have told those attentive shellfish, "and you are troubled when the Wisest Singer proceeds in singing on.  For the syllable you loved is withdrawn and others succeed in order. The Wisest Singer does not sing to you alone, nor at your will.  The Wisest Singer sings to all, and only at the Wisest Singer’s will."\r\n\r\nIn the not too distant future a few broken shards of the CDs of my music will memorialize my own brief, simple, circumscribed existence just as the fossils in my garden wall memorialize those primordial shellfish.\r\n\r\nLike them, I’ve known some light and some darkness, some yearning and some fulfillment.  I’ve managed a little more travel than they did but, relative to the vastness of the universe, my travels haven’t amounted to much; I’ve seen precious little.\r\n\r\nAll those CDs I’ve produced — 16 titles, 20,000 actual CDs and more to come --what do they amount to?  Physically, just so much plastic pollution.  Soon enough they''ll be in landfills or mingling with the sands on the ocean floor.  \r\n\r\nI read somewhere that in thirty years plastic will occupy more space in the ocean than fish!  Our seven seas will never be rendered clean of plastic.  Here I am, fancying that I care about our environment, yet happily churning out another thousand CDs, this time featuring my cello music.  This Fall, with your permission, I’ll send one to each of you and to every American classical music radio station.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” I hear you exclaiming, "but CDs are different than plastic straws or styrofoam coffee cups or plastic thimbles of half-and-half.  How are CDs any different?  Because they preserve music? because they perpetuate for a few years, the spiritual stuff that dreams are made on?  Does the ’spiritual’ content of those CDs justify their pollution of the planet?  Future generations will not think so.\r\n\r\nHow strange to reflect that the shards of the plastic CDs I’ve gone to such trouble and expense to bring into being will, physically, far outlast all memory of me, my life’s work, my music, my world.  Two thousand years hence, when the memory of our nation is as remote from the present day as ancient Rome is from  this moment, our June of 2018, when all that we have thought and dreamed and made has been utterly forgotten, those smashed shards of my CDs will be “asleep in the deep," along with all the rest of the detritus, most of it as yet unmanufactured, that we humans will subsequently discard and pile on top of what we’ve already thoughtlessly deposited in landfills or cast adrift in oceans.\r\n\r\nA shard of a CD will have precisely the same relation to my current self that a fossil has to a long-dead shellfish.  It will be a mere impression, cast in all-but-imperishable plastic.\r\n\r\nThe only response I know to the inarguable truth of that assertion is to invoke the stolid wisdom of old Guigo the Carthusian by setting his words to music.\r\n\r\nA text as pithy as Guigo''s demands a terse treatment.  My setting of his text clocks in at one minute, thirty-nine seconds.  \r\n\r\nArtistically, as a choral anthem, it is flawed in this respect:  it is too short.  By repeating the opening phrase I could have brought the anthem closer to the standard length of the genre.  But it the very brevity of the piece that IS the point.  \r\n\r\nThe life of a shellfish is short, however long its fossil may endure.

It led to more questions.\r\n\r\nRembrandt left over a hundred self-portraits.  In some, he depicts himself as a buffoon, a clown, an idiot, grimacing grotesquely or drunkenly holding high a glass of spirits.  In others, he appears as a philosopher, a magus, palette and brushes in hand, a canvas before him, his face half in shadow, master of an arcane craft. \r\n\r\nWhich ‘self’ would I portray?  \r\n\r\nThis fluctuating and intermittent creature we call our “self” is by no means simple.  It includes the following:  First, the person we think we are.  Second, what we imagine the world might think we are.  Third, what the world really thinks we are (if the world thinks of us at all, which is unlikely).  Fourth, a curious beast, altogether strange and amazing to the first three, our actual “self”!\r\n\r\nThese are but four of our many “selves.”  We are an aggregate of hundreds.  \r\n\r\nIn one sense every piece of music is a self-portrait of the composer.  But there is no genre of musical self-portaits, no works to which I could have turned for precedence and guidance.  As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving or at least somewhat interesting.\r\n\r\nAt first I imagined a single movement.  It would be scored, of course, for clarinet and cello (my favorite instruments) with a piano in the background.  It would be my Trio #8 for that combination of instruments.  Remembering Rembrandt’s examples, should I depict myself as a Fool?  or as a Sage?\r\n\r\nThen it struck me.  Both!  Two movements!  The first would be subtitled “Self-portrait as a Fool.”   The second, “Self-portrait as a Sage.”\r\n\r\nThe “Fool" movement came easily enough.  I’m very aware of myself as a blundering blockhead, a silly jester.\r\n\r\nBut a “Sage?"  Who, me?  Really?\r\n\r\nWhat sagacity can I claim?  The question prompted thought.\r\n\r\nA sage, it seems to me, reconciles opposites, perceives their sources, then attempts transcendence.  Consider the greatest of opposites:  Good & Evil.  \r\n\r\nDuring these recent, troublous times, I have asked myself, more frequently than ever, How shall Evil be explained?  What is wrong with us?  Why can’t we behave ourselves and take care of things?\r\n\r\nI think Evil results from a bad choice many of us make.\r\n\r\nAt some point, we conclude:  “Life is difficult.”\r\n\r\nFrom there, in ways large and small, we settle on one of two paths.  \r\n\r\nEither we say, “Life is difficult:  I’ve got to watch out for myself.”  \r\n\r\nOr we say, “Life is difficult:  We’ve got to watch out for each other.”\r\n\r\nPeople who watch out for themselves cherish above all else the ‘freedom’ to accrue riches and power, resisting and bitterly resenting attempts by anyone or anything to constrain them.  Evil arises from this.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, people who watch out for each other cherish above all else the advancement of the common good.  Good arises from this.\r\n\r\nWe see, every day, how this choice plays out in politics, the economy, the environment, personal relations, everything.\r\n\r\nIt was this insight that led me, five years ago, to begin writing and sharing these weekly emails with friends and fans and to institute a policy of giving away my music, free of charge, to anybody who is interested in discovering it.  I hope my doing so will advance, in small measure, ‘the common good.’\r\n\r\nThe despair that arises from a stark contemplation of the roots of Evil led me to write my "Self-portrait as a Sage" in that darkest of keys, the deep indigo E flat minor.  The inherent challenge of moving, musically and metaphorically, from feelings induced by contemplating the roots of Evil to those arising from a contemplation of the Good, led me to find my way from E flat minor to C major.  Then back to E flat minor, seein'' has how Evil won’t be taking its leave anytime soon.  \r\n\r\nAnd that statement, mind you, is coming from an optimist!\r\n\r\nRemember Walt Whitman.  No one was ever more hopeful than he, for the human race, for democracy.  Yet even Walt, observing the wicked selfishness of his fellow sojourners, shook his head sadly and asked, “Who shall soothe these feverish children?"\r\n\r\nTo hear my "Self-portrait as a Sage,” the second movement of my Trio #8 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Two Self-portraits," played by the Trio da Camera, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),51);

You don’t expect someone so cheery and chirpy to be in such frequent contact with the spirit world.  Bernice is.  \r\n\r\nJust last Monday we met at a café for coffee and not twenty minutes had passed before she told me about receiving counsel from her late, beloved husband, John.  She said that a few days before she was looking at the grand view of the Ohio River she has from her apartment and suddenly found herself missing John  sorely, her eyes misting with tears.  Suddenly, she heard a deep voice, right there in the room with her, unmistakably her husband''s.  “Get on with living, Bernice,” said the voice.  \r\n\r\n“It was just the sort of thing John would say,” she told me.  “A brusque, manly sort of a remark.  And he was right.  It was good advice.  I’m sure it was him!”\r\n\r\nWhat can one say?  I smiled and nodded.  We went on to other subjects.\r\n\r\nBernice, merry and mystical.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Bernice” from my Trio #9 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Five Women," played by clarinetist Laurel Bennet, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander, (the musicians who recorded it on my CD “Winds of May”), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThis message is longer than usual, because I have two stories to tell, confluent in a single piece of music.  \r\n\r\nBoth took place in France and in French.\r\n\r\n					*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nI wrote thirteen trios for clarinet, cello and piano; I’ve written more works for that combination of instruments than for any other.  \r\n\r\nWhy?  because the clarinet and the cello are my favorite instruments and because I had the encouragement of ‘les Gavottes,’ a trio of Frenchmen who play those instruments.\r\n\r\nThe fact that les Gavottes were French inspired me, too.  My ancestors were French, I speak and teach French, I’ve visited France eight times.  The French flag flies alongside Old Glory on my front porch.  I love France!\r\n\r\nWhen les Gavottes'' recording of the first three of my trios was released, I flew to France to be on hand for a concert featuring the works and an ‘unveiling’ of the new CD.  I had already enjoyed a long friendship with the clarinetist; now I struck up new friendships with the cellist and the pianist.\r\n\r\nThe three musicians and their wives / significant others celebrated with a post-concert dinner party in the home of the cellist.   My French friends, new and old, were easy and amiable; they took care to help me feel that I was, truly, the Guest of Honor.  \r\n\r\nOur spirits were high; the conversation flowed, as did the wine.\r\n\r\nMy French is pretty strong but, for my sake, they probably made some effort to limit their vocabulary and the complexity of their sentences, at least when speaking with me.  Though the evening was passed entirely in French, I never felt left out.  Still, knowing keen acuity would be required  if I hoped to participate in the conversational ''flow of soul,’ I limited my intake of the noble wine served by our host.\r\n\r\nThe other guests did not so limit themselves.  Midnight passed; the party was going strong.  My longtime friend, Lucien, the clarinetist, opined that this new CD of my music would be the making of all of us; it would establish our reputations around the world;  fame, glory and wealth would soon be showered upon us. \r\n\r\nHaving drunk less wine than Lucien, I felt that this exuberant expression needed a bit of tempering.  However heartfelt, It was, after all, only one little recording in a very large world.  I remarked that experience had taught me to temper my expectations.\r\n\r\n“Mais tu es pessimiste!” cried Lucien, half-joking.\r\n\r\n“Non,” I replied.  “Au contraire!  Je suis optimiste qui n’est pas arrivé!”\r\n\r\n(My French friends didn’t know it, but I was quoting, albeit in French, Mark Twain’s response to the same accusation; he said, "I am an optimist who did not arrive.”)\r\n\r\nFrench people prize a witty remark especially when it comes from someone who has shown they love the French language and are trying their best to utilize it in a conversation.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!  Bravo!” my friends shouted, laughing and raising their glasses in a spontaneous toast, joyfully repeating my bon mot, “Un optimiste qui n’est pas arrivé!”\r\n\r\nThat was a moment to remember, to have gotten off a bon mot at a French dinner party, the summit of my linguistic adventures in French.\r\n\r\n					*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nAnd now the second little story ...\r\n\r\nWhen someone told the hostess at a neighborhood party that I spoke French, she excitedly introduced me to another guest, Émilie Hetru, a twenty-something French au pair employed by a family I knew slightly.  We hit it off right away, bubbling along en français.\r\n\r\nShe had charm, intelligence and vitality in spades, a French ''pipterino of the first water’ (one of PG Wodehouse''s many admirable phrases).  Like every French woman I have met, she projected femininity.\r\n\r\nWe met for coffee from time to time, an opportunity for me to brush up my French and for her to question me about the mysteries of America and our American language.  \r\n\r\nShe would ask questions like, “To be raining zee cats and dogs, what does ziss want to say?”   Her pronunciation of “Turkeyfoot Road” was hilarious.\r\n\r\nWe set off bicycling one sunny morning and returned several hours later, laughing, drenched by a stray thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nWe became good friends.  (Now, don’t get me wrong!  I’m a faithful husband who has had the good fortune to form friendships with several wonderful women.  All those friendships continue; I got a cheery email from Émilie just last week.)\r\n\r\nWhen Émilie''s year-long term as an au pair ended, we bade one another au revoir and she returned to France.  I was sorry to see her go, but we have kept in touch.\r\n\r\nA year or two later, in Paris to see musician friends, I took the train to Lille to see Émilie, meet her family (her parents are my age) and to pass a few days as an honored guest in their home.  They welcomed me as if I was a long-lost American uncle.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful morning — and that is saying something because the weather is often very dreary au nord de la France — we set out for Bruges, a town in the Flemish regions of neighboring Belgium.  \r\n\r\nWe strolled about, went for a ride in a boat on the city’s canal system, laughed together at the jokes the boat’s pilot made, then found a quiet, shaded little park near an ancient stone bridge spanning the canal and settled there to share a picnic she had prepared.  It was wonderful, of course.  How could it not have been?  The French are serious about food.  Even a cold picnic is splendid.\r\n\r\nWe dozed on the blanket afterwards; letting the wine wear off.  Then we strolled some more, taking in the architecture of that amazing municipality, a living museum of the Middle Ages, perfectly preserved.\r\n\r\nAt length, the day wore away and we turned our noses toward the edge of town, where Émilie had parked the family car.  She fell silent as we walked and I wondered what she was thinking.  She sighed.  \r\n\r\nThen she said, in her French-accented English, \r\n\r\n		“Perfect day ...  Perfect place ...  Perfect man.”\r\n\r\nI did not break the pace of my walking but my shoe soles lost contact with the pavement as I began to float, ambling up an invisible staircase.  It was easy because I was weightless.  The view was very nice from up there but not wanting to leave Émile alone below, I descended, after a time, back down to the street.  \r\n\r\n(just kidding, just kidding).\r\n\r\nDelivered by such a person in such an accent on such a day in such a place, it was one of the supreme compliments of my life.  I will remember it always.\r\n\r\nI memorialized four of my closest friendships with women, along with my good wife, in my Trio #9 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Five Women,” written for les Gavottes  In the scheme of the movements Jo has the place of honor:  she is lovingly depicted in the third movement, the trio''s keystone, as befits the woman who has been and remains the keystone of my life.  \r\n\r\nThe final movement is entitled “The Vitality of Émilie.”  To hear it played by the Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider the rapport between Beauty and Sadness.\r\n\r\nThe qualities seem mutually exclusive.  \r\n\r\nIf something is beautiful, we feel joyful in perceiving it, not sad, n’est-ce pas? \r\n\r\nAt a passing glance, all that is sad seems far removed from all that is beautiful.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, when we were musical partners, my friend mezzo soprano Diane Haslam was sometimes sad, always beautiful.  \r\n\r\nWe have no difficulty comprehending how a person can be both beautiful and sad.\r\n\r\nBut music?\r\n\r\nRecall the saddest music.  The last movement of Tchaikovsky’s 6th symphony.  Mozart’s Masonic Funeral Music.  “Ridi pagliaccio.”  Are these pieces what we mean when we say music is beautiful?  I will risking saying no.  They are well-written, deeply felt, effective and beloved.  Also, I think, un-beautiful.\r\n\r\nAh, but now let’s indulge in the pleasure of recalling the most beautiful music.  \r\n\r\nWhat pieces would you list?\r\n\r\nI’d include the "Heiliger Dankgesang” movement of Beethoven''s String Quartet #15.  The middle movement of Ravel’s Piano Concerto.  The Adagietto of Mahler''s Fifth Symphony.  Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings.”  Finzi’s "Eclogue.”  (If you don’t know that one, google it and give it a listen!)\r\n\r\nEach of these pieces are, I’d say, all the more beautiful because they are simultaneously so beautiful and so sad.  The press of sadness is precisely what renders such music so beautiful.\r\n\r\nCould I write music in that vein, sympathetically portraying a friend at a particularly difficult and emotionally fraught period in her life?  I could try.  I did my best.\r\n\r\nI’m glad to be able to assure you that Diane moved on and is, I gather, abundantly happy and fulfilled nowadays. \r\n\r\nThat assurance was not yet forthcoming when I attempted this portrait.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Diane:  Beautiful and Sad,” the fourth movement from my Trio #9 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Five Women," played by clarinetist Laurel Bennet, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander, (the musicians who recorded it on my CD “Winds of May”), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we sit here, you and I, in our respective bubbles, enduring the daily onslaught of crises as best we can, Nature goes about her business.  \r\n\r\nMid-August is upon us, right on schedule, despite all our crises, bringing a heightened awareness that is unique to this time of year.  \r\n\r\nJames Agee says it economically:  "High summer holds the earth."\r\n\r\nOdell Shepard, a largely forgotten writer whom I admire for the musicality of his prose and the nobility of his thoughts, says it loquaciously:\r\n\r\n	"Slowly, leaf by leaf, the landscape is turning golden and ruddy, like an apple, beneath these August suns.\r\n	I can almost see the landscape change before me while I gaze.  Certainly it is richer and more various in tone than when I stood here yesterday.  If I am to watch the splendor of the year mount slowly through all its delicate gradations, I must be vigilant from hour to hour.  \r\n	Early summer’s monotony of green has given place to the tints of maturity; brown and purple, dim orange and umber are faintly discernible along the lower slopes, and there are rare touches of scarlet from the dogwood and sumac in the thicket.  The cedars far and near begin to glow with their peculiar, nameless hue.  Among the solid ranks of the ferns at my feet there is here and there a frond that seems to be made of beaten gold.  \r\n	Winter is a long stern conflict, spring is a brief ecstasy like first love, and autumn is sheer amazement, but late summer brings us peace."\r\n\r\nAh!  That is writing I can admire.  I could set those words to music.  Maybe I should, though they are already singing the tuneless song of all good prose.\r\n\r\nA moment of respite and a measure of peace are bestowed upon us when we open ourselves to such an expression.\r\n\r\nMusic also can be a ‘place’ of respite.  Today I want to share music that eschews “the monotony of green,” taking us instead through a process of maturing, the way August does, passing through and then beyond “brown and purple, dim orange and umber and touches of scarlet.”  \r\n\r\nMuch of the best music is very strictly unified.  Great pieces grow from a single idea.  Just one, mind you!  And never stray far from the opening key!  That is how music expresses “being” rather than “becoming.”  \r\n\r\nA Bach invention does not “become” as we listen to it.  It already is.  From the git-go, it is perfectly centered upon itself.  It begins, proceeds and ends in a perfect place.  It is the music of stability, certitude.  it not the music of exploration and transition.  It delineates invention, not re-invention.\r\n\r\nThe second movement of my Trio #9 for clarinet, cello and piano delineates re-invention.  It was inspired by a friend who always grows in new directions, evolving her spirituality and her career, re-inventing herself.\r\n\r\nAs I hope you’ll hear, the music metaphorizes the process of becoming as it turns into something new, again and again, reviving, moving forward, discovering new aspects, new ‘places’ to be, harmonically, new roles to play, thematically. \r\n\r\nThis music is loquacious, not economical.  Bach is economical; this music is not.  Instead of developing a single subject as a fugue does or two contrasting themes as a sonata does, it offers multiple tunes that spread in unexpected directions.\r\n\r\nIt begins with a bold motif played by the clarinet and cello.  The listener immediately thinks, “Oh, this is going to be one of those pieces that develops a single short motif.”\r\n\r\nBut in ms. 3, the piano responds with a contrasting motif.  The listener thinks, “Oh!  Two motifs.  Cool.” \r\n\r\nBut then comes a theme.  The listener revises his assumptions, thinking, “The opening motifs were only an introduction; THIS is the main theme.”\r\n\r\nBut then comes another theme and the listener thinks, “No, I was wrong.  THIS is the actual main theme.”\r\n\r\nBut then comes yet another theme … you see?  The music is reinventing itself as the movement unfolds.  And there is a lot of variety among the musical materials.  The second motif and one of the themes even sound a little “Arabian” to me, like a shaving that fell from the bench in the musical workshop of Rimsky-Korsakof.\r\n\r\nOne tune is particularly memorable.  It’s a comely tune!  A winsome tune!  One of my best, I think.\r\n\r\nYou’ll happen upon it at 1:11 in the mp3 and measure 45 in the PDF.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not “the main theme.”  It’s merely one of several equally important themes.  Two or three themes is usually the limit in a piece of classical music but this piece begins with two motifs and then stretches on into five or six themes, depending upon how strictly one defines “theme.”\r\n\r\nYet it is not a free-form fantasia.  The themes recur.  The tune to which I directed your particular attention above is recapitulated at:  6:47, measure 240.\r\n\r\nAll the themes develop, comment upon one another and return.  For all its multiplicity, it’s a ‘sonata-allegro’ form after all.  Just as my friend, for all her reinvention, still remains her endearing self.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Claire” from my Trio #9 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Five Women," played by clarinetist Laurel Bennet, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander, (the musicians who recorded it on my CD “Winds of May”), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nMy good friend Bernice Robinson has passed at the age of 88.\r\n\r\nShe was portrayed in the opening movement of my Trio #9 for Clarinet, Cello & Piano, subtitled, “Five Women.”\r\n\r\nBernice, an Englishwoman, a cellist, an Episcopalian, had lived for many years in Cincinnati.  Bernice was a dear friend and an ardent fan of my music and writings.\r\n\r\nShe was both merry and mystical, a rare combination.  She brimmed with good humor, had a ready laugh, a warm smile, a twinkle in her eye.  Somehow, you don’t expect someone so cheery to be in such frequent contact with the spirit world.  She lived each day with a keen awareness of the spiritual, in both a metaphysical and supernatural sense.  She took spirits for granted; they were part of her world.\r\n\r\nOne time we met at a café for coffee and she told me, in a heartfelt yet casual way, that she had recently received counsel from her late, beloved husband, John.  She said that a few days before, while looking at the grand view of the Ohio River she had from her apartment window, she suddenly found herself missing her husband so sorely that her eyes misted with tears.  Then she heard a deep voice, right there in the room with her, only a few feet away, unmistakably her husband''s.  \r\n\r\n“Get on with living, Bernice,” said the voice.  \r\n\r\n“It was just the sort of thing John would say,” she said.  “A brusque, manly sort of a remark.  And he was right.  It was good advice.  I’m sure it was him!”\r\n\r\nWhat can one say?  I smiled and nodded.  We went on to other subjects.\r\n\r\nThat was Bernice, merry and mystical.  The memory of her is a blessing. \r\n\r\nOnce only, she talked me into accompanying her on the piano in public, something I don’t like to do and try to avoid.  (I am not a musician;  I’m a composer, a different thing.)  \r\n\r\nWe played my Largo Religioso for cello and piano in a service at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian.  The piano part is pretty easy, so I agreed.  Fortunately, it was recorded and I can share it with you now in tribute to and memory of Bernice.  \r\n\r\nTo hear Bernice and me playing my Largo Religioso, click on the link above.\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/bernice.mp3\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/Largo_Relig.pdf\r\n\r\nTo hear “Bernice” from my Trio #9 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Five Women," played by clarinetist Laurel Bennet, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander, (the musicians who recorded it on my CD “Winds of May”), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),77);

Reminding listeners to adjust their clocks for D.S.T. is one of the service announcements that public radio stations provide.\r\n\r\nWhen I worked there, in the late 1970’s, we devoted a portion of our Fridays to  recording, in advance, the commentary and announcements the listeners would hear during the coming weekend.  We strove to give the impression that we were “live,” trying to sound fresh, engaging, spontaneous.  \r\n\r\nThe weekend when radio announcers must remind people to adjust their timepieces was upon us.  You see what’s coming.  \r\n\r\nWith supreme self-confidence (my policy:  “Often wrong, but never in doubt”), I “pre-recorded” my announcement -- carefully, firmly, politely, knowledgeably —  instructing listeners that, to be certain they were setting their clocks correctly, they must bear in mind the useful phrase, "Fall forward, spring back.” \r\n\r\nFriday evening, my weekend’s broadcast “in the can,” I was driving home, listening to the car radio, when I heard another announcer get it right and realized with a jolt that I had gotten it exactly backwards.  \r\n\r\nThere wasn’t a darned thing I could do.  No use phoning the station; the engineers had gone home.  My fate was sealed.  The guillotine blade had been loosed and was already descending in slow motion, second by second.\r\n\r\nMy singular voice would boom out from the ether above Columbus, Ohio, misleading potentially thousands of hapless listeners foolish enough to imagine that I was a friend upon whose wisdom and guidance they could depend.\r\n\r\nWhoever happened to be listening, trusting me, would get it squarely in reverse.  \r\n\r\nPeople would arrive at church or the matinée performance of concert or a play and find the parking lot empty.

It’s lovely!\r\n\r\nPhotos of the house, exterior and interior, can be seen here:  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.redfin.com/OH/Cincinnati/6836-School-St-45244/home/63720744\r\n\r\nThis house feels deeply right to us because it is so like the house we inhabited back in Gambier, Ohio.  The happiest years of our 46-year marriage (and counting) were the six years we passed in Gambier.  Home to Kenyon College, Gambier looks and feels like rural Connecticut, which we love.  \r\n\r\nWe left Gambier with a reluctant farewell.  Our years there had coincided with the era in our lives "when the kids were little” and we knew we’d never return to that time or place.  We love Cincinnati, truly we do.  But we think of Gambier as ‘the good old days.''\r\n\r\nLast month, when we first walked through the front door of what is to be our ’new’ home, we felt we’d come home.\r\n\r\nLiving our final decades in a house so similar to the one in which our kids passed their golden elementary school years will make a beautiful symmetry for us.  The ’new'' property feels like a reward at the end of our long adventure as a couple and as co-founders of a little family.  A happy ending.  It will be our own little Monticello.\r\n\r\nWe will cherish the quiet location, the exposed beams, the hardwood floors and paneling, the fireplaces, the big, old trees in the yard, being able to see more stars at night.  Inspiring!\r\n\r\nToo, the Shaker furniture and the cherry / walnut Ohio country antiques of the 1840’s and 1850’s that we''ve lovingly collected for 46 years will suit that house perfectly.  There will be ample room for Jo to display her collections of red ware, flow blue and bird carvings.  She is visibly a-fizz with excitement.  When she’s through decorating, we’ll be living in what might be termed The Sowash Collection of American Folk Art.\r\n\r\nThere are practical advantages, too:  the house has few stair steps, rendering access easier for us as we accommodate our eventual, inevitable enfeeblement.  The yard is small; there will be few leaves to rake but plenty of sunshine for the day lilies we’ll plant.\r\n\r\nWe will miss being near to all that downtown Cincinnati has to offer:  the main library, Avril’s butcher shop, Allez bakery, Findlay Market, Music Hall, the Art Museum and the restaurants.  We’ve treasured living only two minutes drive from our church.  (It’s been so easy to dash back home when I’ve forgotten to bring something I was supposed to bring, absent-minded artiste that I am.)\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived happily in our apartment building and we’ll leave it, too, with a reluctant farewell (though we’ll welcome the rental income that will be forthcoming from the apartment we’re no longer occupying).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of reluctant farewells, "Reluctant Farewell” is the title of a piece I wrote a few years ago for solo guitar, the most intimate of musical instruments.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Reluctant Farewell,” played with great feeling and sensitivity by the Seattle-based virtuoso Hilary Field, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),145);

His crow’s feet wrinkles were gouging deep canyons outward from the corners of his eyes.   His nose gotten itself smashed at some point and we wondered if he had seen action in the boxing ring in his younger days.  His expression was sardonic though I wouldn’t have known that word back then.\r\n\r\nHe had the gravitas that comes with age, another word I wouldn’t have known.  He seemed to be in slow motion, always.  He moved slow, he spoke slow.  Slow-ly.  He was  effective; he introduced us to Roy G Biv and Aitch Two Oh.  \r\n\r\nThe Jr. High School in Lexington, Ohio presented a play every spring.  Having employed no drama teacher, the school appointed Mr. Dotson to direct these productions.  I auditioned and landed a small part.  None of us, perhaps least of all Mr. Dotson, were certain what all a director was supposed to do. \r\n\r\nAt the first rehearsal, Mr. Dotson passed out scripts and sat us in a circle.  As we read our lines aloud, Mr. Dotson, head down, followed the script and listened.  That was all he did.  Just listen.   \r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks, our lines memorized, we rehearsed on the stage just beyond the basketball hoop at one end of the school gym.  Mr. Dotson made sure that we entered and exited from “stage right” or “stage left” (terms new to me).  He pulled together some shabby upholstered furniture, a shelf of used books, a few framed art prints and French doors with a fake tree just outside to suggest the living room of the country estate where the action of the play was to unfold.  He rounded up props and made sure that the stage crew placed them where they belonged.\r\n\r\nAs for blocking, pacing, expression, characterization, we were on our own.  We did our best.  So far as we could tell, the production seemed to be coming together.\r\n\r\nThere was one minor problem.\r\n\r\nIn one of the dialogues there were three or four lines which made no sense to us.  We asked Mr. Dotson to explain what this exchange meant.\r\n\r\nFrowning with concentration, he examined the passage for much longer than I thought would be required to read a few lines.  \r\n\r\nAt length, he lifted his gaze from the script and considered our faces, one by one.  \r\n\r\nThen he said, in his deliberate, authoritative way, “There is an ancient tradition of the theatre, practiced by playwrights for centuries --  Sophocles, Euripides, Shakespeare, all of them, even playwrights who are alive today.  They always insert into each and every play a few lines that make no sense.  Playwrights are artists and artists are eccentric.  They do things like this; no one knows why.  You are smart kids and you have discovered the exact lines in this particular play that make no sense.  Just say them anyway.  No harm will come of it.  It keeps the tradition alive.”\r\n\r\nWe were surprised by this explanation but we bought it.  We felt proud to know that we were smart enough to identify the lines in this particular play which the playwright had deliberately inserted so as to continue the tradition of ''the lines that made no sense.''  \r\n\r\nWe performed the play for an audience of our parents, grandparents and siblings, all of them seated in folding metal chairs arranged in rows on the shiny, hardwood gym floor.  When it was over, we took our bow as our relatives applauded.  That was that.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, every time I saw a play I paid very close attention so that I could be sure to spot the three or four meaningless lines that the playwright had slyly inserted into the script.  I ALWAYS found them.  They were ALWAYS there, waiting to be identified, ''the lines that made no sense.''  It was part of the fun of seeing a play, an element of the theatre-going experience.  I liked being in on an ancient, esoteric theatrical tradition.  \r\n\r\nWhen I was in college it occurred to me that Mr. Dotson’s explanation was odd.  What playwright would impose intentionally meaningless lines on the actors who presented his plays?  When a play''s lines had seemed meaningless to me, was it possible that I had simply missed the meaning?  Had the meaning of the lines had been there all along, plain as the nose on my face?  Perhaps I was not as smart as I had thought.\r\n\r\nOr had Mr. Dotson, unable to explicate the puzzling lines in our play, feigned a deep knowledge of the theatre, invented an arcane tradition on the spot so as to avoid admitting that he had no more notion of what the lines meant than we did?  Maybe he hadn’t bothered to carefully read the script, hadn’t required himself to comprehend all the lines.  Sophomoric, I dismissed him as a fish out of water, a 7th grade science teacher directing a play.  Harrumph.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the decades have drifted by, the matter seems less clear.    \r\n\r\nIt’s just possible that Mr. Dotson, possessed of a dry, inventive sense of humor, fashioned a kind of gift for us, a quasi-explanation that would keep us wondering for years to come.\r\n\r\nThen again, perhaps he was sharing his honest response to the deliberate ambiguity that is to be found in almost all art forms?  Deliberate ambiguity is much admired and discussed, a hallmark of the greatest art.  It’s one reason why masterworks continue to intrigue us.  We can’t entirely explain the characters we know as Hamlet, MacBeth,  King Lear and a host of others.  If we could explain them, we’d have tired of them long since.\r\n\r\nThere ARE, of course, entire plays that are deliberately absurd.   ''Theatre of the Absurd'' was all the rage among European playwrights in the 1950’s, just a few years before I performed in the annual theatrical production at Lexington Jr. High School.  Maybe Mr. Dotson, a teacher in rural Ohio, had heard about ''Theatre of the Absurd'' and was applying his newfound knowledge.\r\n\r\nMany an avant garde non-play, non-novel, abstract ballet, post-post-modern painting or sculpture has made a Big Splash.  Catching a distant echo of such goings-on, Mr. Dotson might have slowly shrugged his big shoulders, concluding that if parts or even all of these works made no sense, well, considering that playwrights are artists, it was to be expected.  \r\n\r\nDotson’s dictum:  “Artists are eccentric."\r\n\r\nWhat about music?  Have composers deliberately inserted a meaningless phrase into an otherwise logical composition?  Not the undersigned.  Could there be such a thing as ''Music of the Absurd?''  Non-music?  Anti-music?  Not in my œuvre.  Nor in any serious musical expression, according to Leonard Berstein.\r\n\r\nMaestro Bernstein, writing in 1966, a few years after Mr. Dotson was, perhaps, coming to terms with ''Theatre of the Absurd,'' observed: \r\n\r\n	“What works in other arts does not necessarily work in music.  We are constantly hearing negative phrases:  anti-art, anti-play, anti-novel, anti-hero, non-picture, non-poem.  [Such works] attract a large following, even succeed in moving us deeply.\r\n	[A list of such works] could become a very long indeed; but there is one thing it could not include -- a piece of serious anti-music.  Music cannot prosper as a non-art, because it is basically and radically an abstract art, whereas all the other arts deal with real images -- words, shapes, stories, the human body.\r\n	Music must be excluded from this tendency in the arts … because it is abstract to start with; it deals directly with the emotions through a transparent medium of tones which are unrelated to any representational aspects of living.”\r\n\r\nMaestro Bernstein''s thoughts bring me to the music I hope to share with you today.  A setting of Walter de la Mare’s strange, cold, distant, beautiful poem, “Wanderers,” the music, in order to suit the text, had to be commensurately beautiful, distant, cold and strange.  \r\n\r\nBut not devoid of meaning, not absurd.  If it seems meaningless and absurd to you, please give the song a second listen, maybe a third.  \r\n\r\nHopefully, you’ll find that the weirdness is apt, after all, even beautiful in an other-worldly way.  This music didn''t emerge from my usual ‘neck of the woods.’  It’s not what you’ve come to expect from your dear old Uncle Rick, but it might intrigue you.  \r\n\r\nHere''s the poem:\r\n\r\nWanderers by Walter de la Mare\r\n\r\nWide are the meadows of night,\r\nAnd daisies are shining there,\r\nTossing their lovely dews,\r\nLustrous and fair;\r\n\r\nAnd through these sweet fields go,\r\nWanderers ‘mid the stars --\r\nVenus, Mercury, Neptune,\r\nSaturn, Jupiter, Mars.\r\n\r\nAttired in their silver, they move,\r\nAnd circling, they whisper and say,\r\nFair are the blossoming meads of delight\r\nThrough which we stray.\r\n\r\nTo hear the rich, dark mezzo voice of Susan Olson singing “Wanderers,” from my cycle “Silvery Songs” for mezzo, flute and piano, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),125);

I wrote songs; Diane sang them in recitals.  It was wonderful.\r\n\r\nDiane and her husband moved to Aiken SC where she flourishes as a choir director, singer and teacher.

At least it’s in sight.  \r\n\r\nSomeone said we should change the name of the month of March and call it “Mud” instead.  I can see that.\r\n\r\nThe long slog through March is before us.  Ah, but after that comes blessed April.\r\n\r\nStill, while winter is yet with us, let’s try to find something positive in it.  \r\n\r\nThat’s me, in a nutshell.  A jolly soul.  I’m like the fellow of whom Samuel Johnson quipped, “All his life he tried to be a philosopher but cheerfulness kept breaking in."\r\n\r\nBack in 1976 I wrote a duet for mezzo and baritone, setting to music Elizabeth Coatsworth’s adorable poem, “On a Night of Snow."\r\n\r\nHere ’tis:\r\n\r\nCat, if you go outdoors, you must walk in the snow.\r\nYou will come back with little white shoes on your feet,\r\nlittle white shoes of snow that have heels of sleet.\r\nStay by the fire, my Cat. Lie still, do not go.\r\nSee how the flames are leaping and hissing low,\r\nI will bring you a saucer of milk like a marguerite,\r\nso white and so smooth, so spherical and so sweet–\r\nstay with me, Cat. Outdoors the wild winds blow.\r\n\r\nOutdoors the wild winds blow, Mistress, and dark is the night,\r\nstrange voices cry in the trees, intoning strange lore,\r\nand more than cats move, lit by our eyes’ green light,\r\non silent feet where the meadow grasses hang hoar–\r\nMistress, there are portents abroad of magic and might,\r\nand things that are yet to be done. Open the door!\r\n\r\nThe song doesn’t stop there.  The soprano keeps begging, “Stay with me, Cat,” while the baritone repeats “Open the door!”\r\n\r\nI will long remember when Diane Haslam and Chris Miller performed the duet.  Chris, a cat-lover, sang with his eyes as wide open as he could stretch them, assuming the feline’s mad gaze.  Diane cajoled him but he wouldn’t take no for an answer and even rubbed his shoulder against hers, exactly in the way a cat will rub its owner''s leg.  It was a miniature musical comedy and the audience loved it.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, three friends, flutist Suzanne Bona, cellist Josh Aerie, and pianist Greg Kostraba, who subsequently formed the Sylvan Trio, convinced me to write a piece for them which could be featured on a forthcoming CD of my music.\r\n\r\nAfter fifty years of tune-smithery, I had put down my composing pen.  Still, I took it up again, sort of, and expanded four separate vocal works, written earlier, into a suite.  I titled it “Seasonal Breezes,” as it depicts the play of the wind at various times of the year.  The “Winter Breeze” movement, which closes the suite, is a re-scoring and re-imagining of the duet, “On a Night of Snow.”  The flute is, more or less, the soprano, i.e., the lady in the poem and the cello is, more or less, the cat.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Winter Breeze:  On a Night of Snow" from Seasonal Breezes played by the Sylvan Trio (flutist Suzanne Bona, cellist Josh Aerie, pianist Greg Kostraba), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the vocal duet version, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you read the Tao Te Ching?  \r\n\r\n(If not, I’ve included it as an attachment at the bottom of this message.

Then I return to the text.  \r\n\r\nThis ambiguous little book, written 600 years before the time of Jesus, addresses the most pressing particulars of my life at whatever moment I happen to be reading it.\r\n\r\nReading it clarifies my thoughts about what is going on in my life, my family, my church, my school, our country and our world.\r\n\r\nA copy sleeps in my nightstand, patiently awaiting my next perusal.  This copy has been my companion in many places and on many journeys.  Its corners are dog-eared, its pages coffee-stained and thumbworn.  It’s a little warped from having been dropped and quickly snatched from the water on a canoe trip.  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, this copy nestled in my coat pocket.  On snowy mornings or sleepy summer weekday afternoons, when the galleries were empty, I would read a few pages, pondering the thoughts anew.  I especially loved to peruse ''the Tao'' when I was guarding the Asian galleries.  I fancied that the book felt a little more at home in those parts of the museum and would thank me for opening it there.\r\n\r\nIn my very personal copy, the margins of every page are dense with handwritten notes, my marginalia.   I rarely write in books but ''the Tao'' awakens the dormant marginalialist in me.  It’s the result of my having thought, thought, and thought about what is being said and how each of the book''s little thought-lets (or poem-kins) applies to the moment when I happen to be reading it.\r\n\r\n(Isn’t ''poem-kins'' a sweet little word?  I just made it up!)\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will welcome some examples.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of the many lines I''ve pondered, long and hard:\r\n\r\n"He who has power over others\r\ncan''t empower himself."     (Oh?  Why not?  What power do I have over others?  How can I rid myself of it?  If I could use power to do good, would the world’s gain warrant the concomitant loss of power I’d have over myself?  Having lost power over myself, could I still perceive what is good and use my power, such as it is, to bring good into the world?  Gandalf could easily have snatched the ring from Frodo and tried to use its power to do good, but he does not.  Why not?  Gandalf read the Tao Te Ching.)\r\n\r\n"If you realize that you have enough,\r\nyou are truly rich."     (Ah, but how much is enough?  what does it mean to be ''truly rich''?)\r\n\r\n"The more he [the Master] gives to others,\r\nthe wealthier he is."     (‘giving’ in what sense?  giving what?  ‘wealthier'' in what way?)\r\n\r\n"Success or failure: which is more dangerous?"     (what are the dangers of success? of failure?)\r\n\r\n"Give evil nothing to oppose\r\nand it will disappear by itself."     (what about Hitler?  Stalin?  unopposed, would they have disappeared?  would Gandhi agree?  is this wisdom or naiveté?)\r\n\r\n"Care about people''s approval\r\nand you will be their prisoner."     (how exactly?  what about family, friends?  are we their prisoners?)\r\n\r\n"Do your work.  Then step back.\r\nThe only path to serenity."     (what work?  the task at hand?  household chores?  a day''s work?  a life''s work?  why is doing your work, then stepping back, the only path?)\r\n\r\n"When her [the Master’s] work is done,\r\nthe people say, "Amazing:\r\nwe did it, all by ourselves!”  (how can one teach students or organize a church pancake supper or lead a nation in such a way that when the work is done the people will say, “Amazing:  we did it, all by ourselves!”?) \r\n\r\nLao Tzu, the semi-legendary author of ''the Tao,'' rarely tells us what to do.  He tells us what the Master does.  Are we to do likewise?  Do we want to be a Master?  A Master of what, exactly?  \r\n\r\nThink!  Think!  Think!  See what I mean?\r\n\r\nI''d love to share much more about this remarkable little book ... the advice for artists ... the counsel about governance of self, family, classroom, nation ... the notion of ''action through non-action'' … personal finances … home economy … the lessons water can teach us ... the glimpses into mystical experience … did the Tao influence Jesus? … plus humor, yes!

I wrote out the first two quatrains immediately and I nailed the last two within the next fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nMind you, I make no grand claims for this poem.  If you want to read great poetry, re-read Walt Whitman’s "Song of Myself.”  \r\n\r\nStill, here is my little poem:\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m an old-fashioned man\r\nwith an old-fashioned life.\r\nI’ve an old-fashioned house\r\nand an old-fashioned wife.\r\n\r\nI like old-fashioned food\r\nand old-fashioned books,\r\nold-fashioned whiskers\r\nand old-fashioned looks.\r\n\r\nI’ll keep living this way,\r\nas an old-fashioned man,\r\nwith my house, wife and books\r\nfor as long as I can.\r\n\r\nAnd then I’ll move on\r\nin the old-fashioned way,\r\nserene and content\r\nto let come what may.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s why I am sharing my little poem.\r\n\r\nIf I hadn’t already told you that I wrote it last week, when would you guess that poem was written?  Anytime in the last hundred years, wouldn’t you say?  Everything about its form and content is ‘old-fashioned’ (rhyming couplets in four quatrains!).  Yet there’s nothing to prevent it from having been written last week.\r\n\r\nI wrote the tunes and harmonies of my ’Summer Breeze,’ the second movement of my suite “Seasonal Breezes for Flute, Cello & Piano”, in 1976 as a choral piece.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, I revised, expanded and rescored it.  The new version for flute, cello and piano was recorded last year. \r\n\r\nAfter listening to it (see below), consider this:  If I hadn’t already told you,  when would you guess that this music was written?  Anytime in the last hundred years, wouldn’t you say?  Everything about its form and content is ‘old-fashioned’ (it’s in Rondo form; it opens and closes with simple scales in the very old-fashioned key of C major!).  \r\n\r\nYet there’s nothing to obviate the possibility that it was written last week.\r\n\r\nBut, could my poem and music have been written one hundred and FIFTY years ago?  No.  The poem is too plain-spoken to have been written during the reign of Queen Victoria, when Tennyson and Longfellow set the standards.  Were I writing in 1869, my little poem would have been insufficiently florid.\r\n\r\nThe music could not have been written before Debussy, who was seven years old in 1869 and would die in 1918.  His ‘impressionistic’ touch, his unexpected modulations, his pianistic writing all find an echo in this music.  \r\n\r\nYet it doesn’t sound like Debussy.  It sounds American.  That is another reason it could not have been written 150 years ago.  Truly American-sounding classical music didn’t get heard until the 1920’s.  When it did arrive, it owed a good deal to French music;  Copland, Thomson, Harris, Gershwin, all had formative musical experiences in Paris.\r\n\r\nMy point is that some of the artistic expressions we encounter could have first seen the light of day on pretty much any day over quite a long stretch of time.\r\n\r\nThe more conservative, i.e., ‘old-fashioned’ the artwork is, the longer will be the stretch of time during which it might have been created.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear ’Summer Breeze,’ I think you’ll agree that it doesn’t seem ‘dated.’  You probably remember the pop music of the Seventies … “Stayin’ Alive,” “YMCA”, “We’ve Only Just Begun” “What’s New, Pussycat?” — nowadays those songs are so dated, so period-specific, as to be laughable.\r\n\r\nYou might say, “But those were POP songs.  Classical music is different.”  There is some truth in that.  Still,  quite a lot of avant-garde classical music was written during the 20th century and much of it already seems just as dated as “Stayin’ Alive.”  Why?  Because it wasn’t conservative, wasn’t old-fashioned, tried too hard to be ‘hip’ as the term was understood and expressed musically back then.\r\n\r\nAll this is to confess my surprise at how conservative I have been, artistically.  I rooted my artistic work in existing traditions that existed long before I came upon the scene.  \r\n\r\nHowever liberal I may be politically, I am temperamentally conservative.  I’m an Eagle Scout, a former Scoutmaster, an every-Sunday church-goer, a faithful husband for 46 years, a loving father and a good teacher.  I never did drugs, not even marijuana.  \r\n\r\nI can say, with Thoreau, “If i repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior.  What demon possessed me that I behaved so well?’  (Of course, Henry was half-joking and so am I.)\r\n\r\nOne compensation of my loyalty to tradition has been that my work, make of it what you will, might have been written last week … a hundred years ago … or on any day in between.  There’s no “shelf time,” no “sell by” a certain date on the label.  No preservatives added, it stays fresh because it abides by a tradition that remains fresh for listeners.\r\n\r\nTo hear ’Summer Breeze’ from my suite “Seasonal Breezes” played by The Sylvan Trio (flutist Suzanne Bona, cellist Josh Aerie, pianist Greg Kostraba), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story behind this piece begins almost half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe earliest version of this music was conceived in my college years as the final song in my cycle for soprano and viola, titled “Songs for the Seven Ages.”  \r\n\r\nA good title but not a good piece of music, I’m afraid.  Schizophrenically trying to be at once true to myself and to write music that would ‘fly’ in the cloistered world of the academic avant garde, I was not up to the task of setting to music texts by Shakespeare. \r\n\r\nThe cycle was sung at a student recital.  I felt sorry for the poor soprano.  She did her best but most of the songs were awful.  The final song, began beautifully but quickly lost its way.  I had a vague notion that I would return to that song some day to extend the beauty of the opening phrases.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about 28 I expanded the final song of the doomed cycle into a choral setting.  There was nothing wrong with the words!  The text is Prospero''s great speech from The Tempest,  the one that begins, "Our revels now are ended,” ending with "We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep.”  \r\n\r\nThhe speech is ‘framed’ by the words “ended” at the beginning and “rounded” at the end.  Beautiful!  Shakespeare at his deft-est!\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the choral piece began with the chorus singing “Ended, ended, ended” before the opening seven-note tune is sung to the words “Our revels now are ended.”  And that same opening chord is sung at the end as well, but this time it is sung to the word “Rounded, rounded, rounded.”  \r\n\r\n“Rounded."  A beautiful word to sing. \r\n\r\nI attempted to embue this choral piece with a radiant resignation, appropriate for the aged magus Prospero.  And I nailed it, I think, in the beginning and the ending ... but I couldn''t manage an effective setting of the middle part of the speech.  The words are dense and gnarly in that part of the speech and not particularly singable.   I was not satisfied with my attempts to score them.\r\n\r\nSome years later, I dropped the middle part altogether and wrote another version of this music, scoring it for violin, cello and piano.  Freed from the attempt to set the words of Shakespeare’s noble text, I invented a new middle section.  \r\n\r\nWhat had been a song, then a choral piece, now became the second movement of my two-movement Piano Trio #4.  \r\n\r\nThe first movement is energetic but rough and thorny; the second movement is gorgeous and resigned.  My idea was to lead musicians and listeners through a thorn bush in the first movement and then to arrive at fragrant roses in the second movement.\r\n\r\nBut no one has ever liked that first movement, not even me.   Who wants to be led through a thorn bush?  When Beethoven gets rough and energetic, everybody loves it.  I''m not Beethoven.  I can''t do that sort of music effectively because it doesn''t arise from my True Self.\r\n\r\nWhat''s more, I blundered badly in scoring the second movement.  I took the cello way, way up high ... so high that it is freakish.  When the Mirecourt Trio recorded the work, the cellist Terry King, a superb musician in every sense of the word, had to do more than sixty takes of that high part before he finally got one that satisfied him.  \r\n\r\nNow, that was the composer''s fault, not Terry''s.  I was there for the recording session, enduring my punishment.  It is an agony to hear one''s music butchered two or three times, but sixty times is almost beyond bearing, believe me.  The anxiety was intense; I struggled to remain in the studio.  \r\n\r\nI hated that experience so much that I have done my best to avoid being in that situation again.  As far as possible, without being rude, I refuse to be present at sessions where my music is being recorded.\r\n\r\nI wrote the cello part that high because I gathered that cellists love to play up high.  There was no great difficulty for a cellist in ascending but the descent that followed proved almost impossible to play.   \r\n\r\nThe unfortunate result of my blunder is that, because the cello part is so high and because the first movement is so unpleasant, this trio has almost never been performed.\r\n\r\nThe trio is on my CD "Four Piano Trios" which, as with all my CDs, I sent to America''s classical music radio stations.  The  result?  The OTHER three trios get broadcast, but NEVER my Trio #4.  Another punishment.  Broadcasters know, and rightly, that listeners aren''t going to welcome that thorny first movement.  When music like that comes on, listeners will change the channel.  Or turn off the radio.  I know i would.  Who needs it?\r\n\r\nThus, the music of the second movement, so beautiful, so lovely, so radiantly resigned, having come so far, remaied imprisoned in an unplayable work, bound forever to an ugly first movement.  \r\n\r\nI think of Andromeda, chained to a rock and guarded by a hideous sea serpent, waiting to be rescued by Perseus.\r\n\r\nI mourned this music for many years, an unhealed wound.\r\n\r\nThen, about five years ago, cellist Josh Aerie pressed me to write a work for flute, cello and piano, to be featured on a new CD of my music.\r\n\r\nI had an idea that I could re-score this music, yet again, this time for flute, cello and piano, making it part of a four-movement work that would also feature rescorings and expansions of some songs I''d written for voice and piano.  \r\n\r\nAt last I could liberate the beautiful music that was trapped, unheard, in my Piano Trio #4.  Perseus to the rescue!\r\n\r\nI scored the troublous high cello passage for the FLUTE this time, for which high notes sound entirely natural.  The piano opens with the chords that were once scored for a chorus singing:  “ended, ended, ended.”  \r\n\r\nWhen the cello enters it ‘sings’ “Our revels now are ended.  These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air….”  \r\n\r\nThe movement ends with the chords that were sung:  “rounded, rounded, rounded with a sleep."\r\n\r\nI named the newly assembled work "Seasonal Breezes."  Because this movement has the radiant resignation associated with Prospero.  Because Prospero is an autumnal character, and because "The Tempest" is Shakespeare''s last play, his farewell to the theatre, written in the autumn of his years, I named the movement "Autumn Breeze."  \r\n\r\nAt last, Andromeda has been freed.  As I hear this music, I see her, languid and lovely, improvising a fluid dance of quiet joy.  \r\n\r\nLife rarely affords us the opportunity to undo our earlier mistakes.  This movement, and the Sylvan Trio’s gorgeous recording of it, undoes a few mistakes I made many, many years ago.  \r\n\r\nWould that all our regrets could be thus healed.  \r\n\r\nAn autumnal thought, suited to late October.\r\n\r\nTo hear ’Summer Breeze’ from my suite “Seasonal Breezes” played by The Sylvan Trio (flutist Suzanne Bona, cellist Josh Aerie, pianist Greg Kostraba), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nHas the season readied you for a “winter’s tale”?  I’ve got a good one.\r\n\r\n	Live chickens are not permitted within the corporation limits of Bellville, Ohio, but when a tornado blew a big black hen from who-knows-where into our neighbor Charley’s yard, he took it as a sign -- of what, he didn’t say -- and kept her as a pet. \r\n\r\n	A year later, after Death blew Charley who-knows-where, his widow, Francine, became the sole caregiver for the hen, a cherished memento of her late husband.\r\n\r\n	Jo and I were sitting down to sup on potato soup one winter night when there came a knock upon the front door.  It was Francine, distraught.  She said that our Thurber had “got Charley’s chicken.”  She said she had seen Thurber dragging the carcass back and forth between our snow-covered yards, even tossing it into the air.\r\n\r\n	I apologized, said this wasn’t like Thurber, that he usually only chased squirrels.  Francine and I searched both our yards in the dark, expecting to find blood-spattered snow and tattered remains.  We found not so much as a black feather.\r\n\r\n	Francine, unconvinced, returned to her home and I to my potato soup.  Just as I lifted a spoonful to my lips, Thurber scratched on our back door.  I got up, let him in.  The old black yarn stocking cap that had seen long service as Thurber’s wrestling partner and opposing tug-of-warrior had somehow gotten hooked onto the ‘belt buckle’ of his collar.  \r\n\r\n	As I untangled it, I suddenly saw how Francine had arrived at her accusation:  looking out a window, she had seen Thurber in the dim twilight, dragging his black stocking cap alongside; she mistook the cap for Charley’s chicken.  The chicken herself was, no doubt, snug and safe in her coop, sound in body and mind.  Francine had not thought to look for her there.  \r\n\r\n	A simple explanation would set matters straight, restoring our good name as well as Thurber’s.\r\n\r\n	I took the raggedy cap over to Francine’s house and rang the doorbell.  When she opened the door, I joyfully displayed it, holding it aloft in my left hand and pointing to it with my right.  With a big, confident, Midwestern smile, I announced, “Look what I found!”\r\n\r\n	She gave me the look Perseus used to get when he went around carrying, by her horrible hair, the severed head of Medusa.  \r\n\r\n	Except in the movies, I’d never seen anyone faint.  I caught Francine on her way to the floor.  Too late, holding her in my arms, lowering her gently to the carpet, desperate to explain, I cried, “It’s a stocking cap!  A stocking cap!”\r\n\r\n	“It’s a stocking cap,” I said again as she came to.  “It wasn’t your chicken … ”\r\n\r\n	When I got home I told Jo what had happened.  As I once again sat down to supper, she observed, “It’s a good thing, when Francine came over, that we were having potato soup instead of chicken soup.” \r\n\r\nTo hear “On a Night of Snow" from Seasonal Breezes played with spirit by the Sylvan Trio (flutist Suzanne Bona, cellist Josh Aerie, pianist Greg Kostraba), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),79);

About 400 in all.\r\n\r\nMany responded with kindly compliments and expressions of thanks.  Not a few have sent contributions to offset the costs and these continue to trickle in.  Not necessary but appreciated.  Thank you!\r\n\r\nDepositing a check is easy.  Fielding a compliment can be tricky.  Just the other night I attended a chamber music concert where a couple of my pieces were played.  Afterwards when I congratulated the musicians on their spirited performance, they brushed it off with apologies and expressions of frustration about the notes they had flubbed, the parts that didn’t go well, the intonation, what have you.  \r\n\r\nThey meant no harm.  They thought they were being truthful and modest.  But it was ‘a downer’  to hear them piss and moan like that, after my having thanked them for playing so exuberantly.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to hear, what I think they ought to have said, was simply, “Thank you.  I’m glad you enjoyed it.”\r\n\r\ni know where they are ‘coming from.’  I will admit that it’s different when the shoe is on the other foot.\r\n\r\nFor example, a few weeks ago one of you kindly sent me an email, saying:\r\n\r\n	"Every Sunday morning for the past few years, I have been opening my mail, looking forward to finding your message of good cheer and interesting anecdotes and music!  Every week, this little bit of pleasure is sent my way, something I can rely on even in these dark times.  Some weeks your message is the high point for me.  I''ve enjoyed reading your treatise on immigrants (who among us does not descend from immigrants or refugees?), your appreciation of the Shenandoah Valley and so many other treasures of nature, conversing trees, travels to Taipei, fostering dogs, and always a little insight into your motivation for writing the selected piece of the day.  I''ve enjoyed them all, and sometimes dip into my collection of your messages if I need a lift.  I love that you so generously share your music.”\r\n\r\nWell, gosh.  I find myself struggling to remember my own advice and to respond with no apologies or expressions of disappointment, but only with a bare:  “Thank you.  I’m glad you enjoyed it."\r\n\r\nResponding to the free CDs I sent, one of you wrote, "I think you are a wonderful composer and an even better human being.”\r\n\r\nFaced with the assertion that I’m a wonderful composer, I am tempted to say something like, “I ain’t nothin’ next to Beethoven;  I’m a mealy worm next to Sibelius and a peanut next to Bach.”  But that’s not what people want to hear in reply to their thanks.  They deserve better.  So, again, I say, “Thank you.  I’m glad you enjoyed it.”\r\n\r\nBut … “an even better human being?”\r\n\r\nNo.  I cannot let that assertion rest unchallenged because I know myself all too well.\r\n\r\nTruthfully, when I read that assertion, it made me think, right away, of Wendell Berry’s honest little poem:\r\n\r\n\r\n	A warning to my readers\r\n\r\n	Do not think me gentle\r\n	because I speak in praise\r\n	of gentleness, or elegant\r\n	because I honor the grace\r\n	that keeps this world. I am\r\n	a man crude as any,\r\n	gross of speech, intolerant,\r\n	stubborn, angry, full\r\n	of fits and furies. That I \r\n	may have spoken well\r\n	at times, is not natural.\r\n	A wonder is what it is. \r\n\r\n\r\nI cringe when I remember the damage I’ve done when “full of fits and furies,” hurting the feelings of people I deeply love.  \r\n\r\nOr just saying ’The Wrong Thing’ when someone is already hurting.\r\n\r\nOr when I’ve tried to comfort people only to find that I’ve inadvertently turned it around so that they are comforting me.  That’s the worst.  I squirm when I think of those occasions.\r\n\r\nMy only ‘out’ is to remind myself that I honestly try to do the best I can.\r\n\r\nMy intention is always to work on behalf of nourishing environments.  Gardens, kitchens, schools, the natural environment, yes, all those.  Also, a piece of music or a well-told story can be an environment that nourishes those within earshot.  I try to contribute something along those lines.\r\n\r\nI try to be aware that I am leaving a “soul print” everywhere I go.  I borrow that useful phrase from the theologian Kayla McClurg:\r\n\r\n	“We leave not only a carbon footprint as we journey on planet earth, but a soul print as well.  Scattered around us everywhere we go is tangible evidence that we have been in this place.  And as a result of our presence, this place is either more—or less—loving and hopeful and prone toward mercy."\r\n\r\nI try to behave myself, not only for the sake of others but also to preserve my sense of well-being to the extent that I’m able.\r\n\r\n	"Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world."   — GB Shaw\r\n\r\nI revised and expanded Shaw''s wise yet practical quip into a quatrain which I then set to music for mixed voices:\r\n\r\n	Keep yourself all bright and shiny,\r\n	Keep yourself all bright and clean,\r\n	For you yourself are a window\r\n	Through which this world is seen.\r\n\r\nIf I can remember that I am always, everywhere I go, a window through which others are seeing the world, then I will, hopefully, have at least enough presence of mind to smile and to elicit smiles even by saying nothing more than, “Hello, how are you?  Tell me what’s going on in your life,” and then really listen.\r\n\r\nThat’s my intent but, grumpy and frustrated about something or other, I very often fall short of that.\r\n\r\nIt also helps to be reminded that grumpiness is inherently comical.  If you can step out of yourself and observe how you are behaving when you are grumpy, you will laugh.  Even the word, “grumpy,” sounds funny and calls to mind the lone scowler among the otherwise cheerful Seven Dwarves.\r\n\r\nLet me share some music that strikes me as ‘mock grumpy’ or ‘grumpy in an upbeat, jazzy sort of a way’ — it’s the first movement of my little suite for clarinet and cello, “Glory Hallelujah."\r\n\r\nTo hear it expertly played by clarinetist Christopher Bade and cellist Josh Aerie on the new CD of my music, “Seasonal Breezes," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to friends and fans:  Four weeks + two days ago I fell off a staircase and broke my ankle.  Since then, I’ve been in a wheelchair with time on my hands which may explain why this email is longer than usual.  Skim it or skip it, you won’t hurt my feelings!   :-)\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\n	Five of the seven deadly sins have single-syllable names.  Easy to say, hear and grasp:  pride, greed, lust, wrath, sloth.  \r\n\r\n	Envy has two syllables, of course.  Metaphorically, ‘envy’ has to be a two-syllable word insofar as committing envy requires an envy-er and an envy-ee.  (It takes two to tango).  	\r\n\r\n	Hoggish gluttony appropriates for itself three syllables, wouldn’t you know?  Glut-ton-y.  A suitably ugly word.\r\n\r\n	When dark news bombards me I ponder an eighth deadly sin.  It has no short ’n’ easy name and is difficult to describe.\r\n\r\n	It’s the sin of soiling someone else''s view of the world.  \r\n\r\n	I imagine a naive, young person, perhaps one of my students, who, hearing that a house in her neighborhood has been burglarized, concludes, “So that is what the world is like.  There are thieves at large and they are active on my street.”  \r\n\r\n	Though our girl lost no property to the thief, the news of the event permanently soiled the window through which she views reality.  There is no recovering from such a loss.\r\n\r\n	It seems to me that the soiling of that girls’ soul-window qualifies as a deadly sin, an additional burden on the soul of the burglar, concomitant with the burglary, perhaps a sin more evil than burglary.\r\n\r\n	  (Bad news just be broadcast.  I would not censor news that was bad.  To be sensibly cautious and to be effective in watching out for one another, we need to know about the deathly crashes, not only the safe landings.  The truthful proclamation of bad news is an invaluable service, certainly no sin.)\r\n\r\n	Think how the spreading awareness of evil dispirits those who were heretofore in high spirits.  Think of the students, aware of school shootings, who carry their fear to school.  Think of the faithful, aware of shootings in places of worship, who carry their fear to church / temple / mosque.  Consider any gathering of people at a market, a café, a subway, a concert.  Along with  their wallet, spectacles, car keys, watch and umbrella, they must also tote their fear.  \r\n\r\n	Shame and damnation on those deadly sinners whose behavior has rendered normal the burden of carrying these fears wherever we go!\r\n\r\n	Evil are they who then cunningly play upon these justified fears, fanning them into hatred in the hope of acquiring fame, pecuniary gain or political power.  It''s another instance of this same deadly but nameless sin.  \r\n\r\n	How I wish I could label it with a single, bold syllable, easy to say, hear and grasp.  Then I could trumpet the word and say, “See!  There it is!  This is what I mean!”  \r\n\r\n	If we can grasp it, unnamed as it is, we may be motivated to try to live our lives so as to offset its detrimental effects to the best of ability.\r\n\r\n	The seven deadly sins are counter-balanced by the seven virtues.  Interestingly, none of the virtues have single-syllable names.  Chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness, and humility.  Each one is a mouthful.  Why would that be?  It is an accident of the language, but metaphorically suggestive nevertheless.  The number of syllables in the names of the sins and virtues connote that sin is easy to construe while virtue is difficult.\r\n\r\n	Just as I cannot succinctly name this eighth deadly sin I have tried to describe, so I cannot succinctly name an eighth virtue to offset it.\r\n\r\n	Here’s this, instead:  \r\n\r\n	There are those who say:  “Life is difficult; I’ve got to watch out for myself.”  \r\n\r\n	And there are those who say:  “Life is difficult: we’ve got to watch out for each other.”  \r\n\r\n	The latter group counterbalances the former just as my proposed eighth virtue offsets my proposed eighth deadly sin.\r\n\r\n	I try not to judge people who appear to watch out mostly for themselves.  I do not know what their lives are like, what experiences prompt them to behave so selfishly.  Perhaps, early on, they heard about a burglary in their neighborhood and that nudged them into the ‘gotta-watch-out-for-#1’ camp.  \r\n\r\n	I avoid them.  I strongly prefer to hang out with people who mostly watch out for each other (like my friends at church and school).\r\n\r\n	A billion saintly lives could not cleanse all the world''s soiled soul-windows.  Still, simply by trying to watch out for each other as best we can, we might offer a clean, bright window through which two or three among those  around us may perceive the world more positively than they would had we not been present.\r\n\r\n	It doesn’t have to be personal.  Any positive human activity, even when done anonymously and facelessly, can be performed in such a way as to offer that clean, bright window.  \r\n\r\n	I love what Dr. Martin Luther King said:\r\n\r\n	“If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michaelangelo painted or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry.  He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, ''Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.’”\r\n\r\n	I am no Beethoven.  Still, I can ask myself, “If music was written with the explicit intention of offering a bright, clean, musical window through which all within earshot might perceive the world more positively, what would that music sound like?”  \r\n\r\n	In short, what would ‘compassionate’ music sound like?  Fast?  Slow?  Major?  Minor?  What instruments would play such music?\r\n\r\n	Every now and then I’ve managed to write music that aspires to answer that question.  One attempt is the third movement, marked “Religioso," from my suite for clarinet and cello titled, “Glory Hallelujah.”  \r\n\r\nTo hear it played — so beautifully, with such feeling! -- by clarinetist Christopher Bade and cellist Josh Aerie, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),82);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(111,replace(replace('“Speak Gently, Spring” is the name of the middle movement of my suite for cello and piano, “Dark Forest.”  \r\n\r\nThe title of the suite comes from the Russian proverb:  \r\n	“The heart of another is a dark forest.”\r\n\r\nThe title of the second movement comes from the opening of Lew Sarrett’s heartbreaking poem, Four Little Foxes:\r\n\r\n	Speak gently, Spring, and make no sudden sound\r\n	for in my windy valley yesterday I found\r\n	New born foxes squirming on the ground\r\n				Speak gently.\r\n\r\nThe poem is beautiful but too sad to quote in its entirety on a sunny Sunday morning.  Though never employing the word “sorry,” the poem expresses the deepest apologies all right-thinking people yearn to make to all the random victims — plants, animals, humans -- for all the random violence that is visited upon all things that live.\r\n\r\nAn apology requires language; music cannot apologize.  I know of no piece of music that says, “I’m sorry.”  \r\n\r\n(The humorist in me can’t help but chuckle:  imagine a classical music radio announcer smoothly intoning, “And now we turn to the “Apologia #4 for Alp Horn, Sackbutt and Accordion” by Sir Lemuel Gudalphus Primrose, dedicated to Queen Victoria as an act of penitence for the composer’s having inadvertently belched within earshot of Her Majesty.  She was not amused.")\r\n\r\nMusic can evoke the emotions that come with the act of apologizing:   \r\n	the tender sadness of regret, \r\n		the healthy despair of humbling oneself, \r\n			the tenuous hope of forgiveness, \r\n				the resolve that, beginning now, we will try to ’speak gently.’  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have a lot of experience in the making of apologies.  Me and my big mouth.  I squirm when I think how often I’ve managed to say “The Wrong Thing,” even to people I deeply love and esteem, only to realize, later, with intense regret, that I blundered, that the mistake cannot be undone, that all I can do is apologize.\r\n\r\nApologizing often, I have acquired a few skills which might be worth sharing.\r\n\r\n— Ask the ‘apologizee’ if now is a time when you might have a quick word.\r\n\r\n— Position yourself so that your face is level with theirs or, better yet, lower than theirs.  When I had to apologize to two students at my school, “Leaves of Learning,” I found them sitting on the floor in the hallway, eating their lunch;  I sat down on the floor right in front of them.  If they had been standing, I’d have tried to sit in a nearby chair or if no chair was handy, I’d have stood, slumping my shoulders a little.  This might seem more like acting than apologizing, but body language and spatial integrity are important.  If your apology is sincere, considering how to position yourself is not acting;  it’s effective communication.\r\n\r\n— Say “I’m sorry for what I said or did.”  Spell it out.  Be specific about the thing you said or did which you now sorely regret.\r\n\r\n— Avoid saying, “I’m sorry if you…”  It’s not about how the apologizee might have misunderstood you or how they might have been too sensitive, too quick to take offense or less than reasonable in some way.  It’s about YOU acknowledging that YOU know that YOU blundered.  It’s about YOU owning up.\r\n\r\n— Do not make excuses for yourself, such as, “I was having a bad day” or “I’m going through a difficult time right now” or “I had such a lot else on my mind that day.”  What’s the point?  At that precise moment, who cares?\r\n\r\n— Important:  When you’ve made your apology, ask if the apologizee forgives you.  Give them the chance to put it into words.  Ask them:  “Do you forgive me?” or “Can you forgive me?”  Then fall silent.  Listen.  This is the crucial moment.  You are humbling yourself before them and rendering yourself vulnerable to their judgment.  You may need to wait for their response.\r\n\r\n— If they nod or say yes, say, “Thank you.  This means so much to me.  Ever since I said or did that stupid thing, I’ve felt just awful.  But now I’m starting to feel a little better.  Thank you.”\r\n\r\n— Tell them that you have learned from this go-round and that you promise that you’ll try your best not to make the same type of mistake again.\r\n\r\n— Unless they want to say something more, let it rest there.  I’ve found that the apologizees are as eager to put the matter behind them as I am.  As a way of concluding the matter, they’re likely to say, “Oh, it wasn’t that big of a deal” — even though you both know that it was.  If they say that, don’t argue the point.  Let it be.  \r\n\r\n— One last important tip:  when you see the apologies again, a day or two later, whisper in their ear, “Thank you for forgiving me.”  And then move on quickly to whatever else is at hand.  No reply is needed or expected.\r\n\r\nA wise friend of mine says:  "I have sometimes thought that a relationship really becomes solid and authentic when there has been some rift that has been healed, after there have been apologies and reconciliation and things go on with a new and more solid grounding."\r\n\r\nTo hear "Speak Gently, Spring” from Dark Forest performed by cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nI''d love to know what you think about this music; reply if you''re inclined.

He was a bright little guy, very verbal and always desperately hungry for a story.  \r\n\r\nHe would say, “Tell me a LONG story!"  So I would start off with something or other and go on for 15 or 20 minutes, fashioning what I thought was a long story, making it up as I went along.  If you’ve done this, you know that it is mentally draining, even exhausting after awhile.  When my capacity to invent and develop threads of a story wore thin, I would bring it to an end.\r\n\r\nI quickly discovered that ending a story left him angry and crest-fallen.  \r\n\r\n“That wasn’t a LONG story!” Chappy would cry, greatly disappointed.  “I wanted to hear a LONG story!”  \r\n\r\nI finally realized that what he wanted was a “chapter” with an open ending, "to be continued.”  He hated it when characters solved all their problems and lived happily ever after.  He hated THE END.  What he wanted a serial.  \r\n\r\nSo, when I grew weary, or had to see to my chores, I would leave the story hanging, with an enemy ship on the horizon or a mysterious voice coming from the attic or an ominous hint that Fate was devising its next booby trap … whatever … and then we would pick up the story from there another time.  \r\n\r\nThat satisfied him.  He didn’t mind a story stopping, he just didn’t want it to END.\r\n\r\nStorytelling and composing are very closely related.  First cousins, really.  Both art forms pull listeners through a stretch of time.  Both art forms present, develop and recapitulate ideas.  We demand that both art forms conform to an inner logic.  When they do end, however long it takes, they must deliver a satisfying sense of closure.\r\n\r\nThere are some parallels between chapters and movements, but they diverge as regards closure.  Like Chappy, we adore a ''cliff-hanger'' at the end of a chapter but we expect a symphonic movement, when it ends, to feel complete, even when we know, from the program, that another movement will follow.\r\n\r\nThis begs the question, ‘How long should a given piece of music be?’  The length of a Bach fugue seems immutable, like the shape of a fern.  But remember, it could have been almost any length the composer deigned to give it.  \r\n\r\nOne of Beethoven’s piano bagatelles is 19 seconds long.  Some of Mahler’s symphonic movements go on for half an hour or more.  What is the right length for a piece of music?  It depends upon the content and the point at which we’re satisfied that the ideas have been sufficiently developed, recapitulated and concluded.\r\n\r\nThe best music-making, whether in composing or performing, delivers a musical experience that is precisely long enough to feel ‘just right’ for all concerned.\r\n\r\nMusic that is not well written or well performed can seem painfully long.\r\n\r\nListen to P.G. Wodehouse’s character Bertie Wooster recounting his experience of enduring a violin solo in an amateur talent show:\r\n\r\n	"I cannot say whether La Pulbrook''s violin solo was or was not a credit to the accomplices who taught her the use of the instrument.  It was loud in spots and less loud in other spots, and had the strange quality that I''ve noticed in all violin solos of seeming to go on much longer than it actually did.”\r\n\r\nha, ha.  That makes me laugh.  There is no one like Wodehouse.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between the domains of storytelling and music lies the shady glen where Poetry keeps her dwelling.\r\n\r\nHow long should a poem be?  Precisely as long as it needs to be, no more, no less.\r\n\r\nConsider this perfect and perfectly delightful poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay:\r\n\r\nSilver bark of beech, and sallow\r\nBark of yellow birch and yellow\r\nTwig of willow.\r\n\r\nStripe of green in moosewood maple,\r\nColour seen in leaf of apple,\r\nBark of popple.\r\n\r\nWood of popple pale as moonbeam,\r\nWood of oak for yoke and barn-beam,\r\nWood of hornbeam.\r\n\r\nSilver bark of beech, and hollow\r\nStem of elder, tall and yellow\r\nTwig of willow. \r\n\r\nIt is neither too long nor too short.  A single syllable, added or deleted, would undo  its perfection.\r\n\r\nYet, what does this poem mean?  What story does it tell?  These are the wrong questions.  What does a piece of music mean?  What story music tell?  Wrong questions.  The poem pulls us along in much the same way that music pulls us when well written and performed, largely by the sounds it makes.  \r\n\r\nThe poem’s closure is achieved structurally, not as the result of meaning or a narrative that ties up loose ends.  The close similarity of the first and last verses gives us the recapitulation and completion we ask from a poem (or a story or a piece of music).\r\n\r\nIn my piece, “Twig of Willow” for cello and piano, the cello simply articulates the notes one might sing if one were vocalizing the words of Edna''s poem.  If you follow the poem as you listen, I think you’ll hear this.  And I think you’ll agree that the duration of the piece of music is just as perfectly right as the duration of the poem.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Twig of Willow” from the suite Dark Forest wonderfully performed by cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),80);

This song turns that notion on its head.  \r\n\r\nWhy?

Which means that the last syllable of the song is “-cy.”   And on what note is that syllable sung?  Why MIDDLE C, of course!  With a great big C major chord in the piano.\r\n\r\nThe song begins in G flat major, modulating to its opposite extreme on the circle of fifths, i.e. in C major.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, the poem is about how the poet/singer cannot be what the sea is.  \r\n\r\nNo, she can’t.  But at least she gets to end by singing the syllable “-cy” (a homonym for the word “sea”) and on the pitch we call “Middle C” no less!  \r\n\r\nThere’s some comfort for the singer / poet in the irony of that!\r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\n(I’ll confess it again:  composers are nerds.)\r\n\r\nTo hear Susan Olson sing “The Sea Lover” from my cycle, Teasdale Songs, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),132);

That’s the “real America.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is precisely the story of my mother’s side of my family.  \r\n\r\nHer grandparents were illegal immigrants and extremely poor when they arrived in the USA.  They had fled oppression in the Austro-Hungarian empire, her grandfather a deserter from the imperial army.  They disappeared under cover of darkness from the town they had lived all their lives.  They boarded ship using assumed names.  Terrified because they faced certain execution had they been caught trying to leave, they could not risk carrying any luggage.  They sewed what money they had into the linings of their clothes.  \r\n\r\nBy luck or Providence, they were not closely scrutinized at Ellis Island.  They made their way to north central Ohio where they lived obscure, upstanding lives.  They never learned English.  They worked hard, reared a fine, bright and loving son (my grandfather) and ended their days with a small farm of their own.\r\n\r\nThis epic story lingers still in the memories of millions of contemporary Americans.  It is the story at the heart of "My Ántonia,” perhaps the most beautiful of all American novels.  \r\n\r\nThe main character’s story, though woven into the broader story of immigrants making a life in the New World, is itself mundane and could easily have been rendered as a tawdry morality tale.  Ántonia is an immigrant girl who, after being seduced, impregnated and betrayed, triumphs wholesomely, humbly yet resoundingly.  Here is how Àntonia is depicted near the end of the novel:\r\n\r\n	"She still had that something which fires the imagination, could still stop one''s breath for a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things. She had only to stand in the orchard, to put her hand on a little crab tree and look up at the apples, to make you feel the goodness of planting and tending and harvesting at last. All the strong things of her heart came out in her body, that had been so tireless in serving generous emotions. It was no wonder that her sons stood tall and straight. She was a rich mine of life, like the founders of early races.” \r\n\r\nCather achieved what Flaubert had done with "Madame Bovary" and Tolstoy with "Anna Karenina.”  Like those two celebrated authors, she deliberately chose a hackneyed, maudlin, potentially salacious story and then blessed it with a depth of insight, a breadth of empathy and a style of writing that is plainly beautiful, never ‘artsy.’  Her prose is ‘plain spoken’ in the best sense.  Like a still life by Chardin.\r\n\r\nShe wrote a half dozen other masterworks:  "O Pioneers," "Death Comes for the Archbishop," "The Professor’s House,” “The Song of the Lark,”  "Shadows on the Rock,” and "Neighbor Rossicky” (published in a collection of three short novels under the title, “Obscure Destinies”).  I’ve read these books, multilple times.  I mean to read them again one of these days.\r\n\r\nThese books were of the greatest importance to me when I was in my twenties and early thirties, endeavoring to construct, note by note, chord by chord, phrase by phrase, my identity as an Ohio composer.  In those days my artistic aim was to write a body of music that would be, to my part of north central Ohio, what “My Àntonia” and “O, Pioneers" were to Willa''s corner of Nebraska.  It was a high-minded aspiration and it served me well.  When you’re a young artist and the future seems filled with limitless possibilities, that’s the time to reach for the stars.\r\n\r\nEventually, though, I moved on, as did Cather.  "Death Comes for the Archbishop" takes place in New Mexico.  “The Song of the Lark" in Colorado.  "Shadows on the Rock" in 17th-century Québec City.\r\n\r\nHer theme, however, remained the same:  people striving to establish a micro-culture for themselves, a little world that is authentically their own, in which they and their loved ones can thrive, and in a setting where there is scarcely any culture at all, no existing cultural foundation nor any traditions in support of such a struggle.   \r\n\r\nIt’s a universal theme for Americans, isn’t it?  Aren''t we all struggling, even now, to fashion for ourselves and our loved ones an authentic life in which we can thrive?  \r\n\r\nFor 45 years, Jo and I have hung in our kitchen this quotatio, framed and hand-calligraphed:\r\n\r\n		Good cookery,\r\n	a cottage that is a home\r\n		not a plaything,\r\n			gardens,\r\n				repose.\r\n	These are first-rate things\r\n		and out of this first-rate stuff,\r\n			art is made.\r\n					—Willa Cather\r\n\r\nThose two sentences are a credo.  In a few, spare, well-chosen, plain-spoken, homely words — “first-rate stuff!" — Willa evokes a lifestyle, an openness to the inspirations that may arise from things humble and near to hand, and a commitment to the highest artistic standards.   \r\n\r\nIn the Cather creed on our kitchen wall, power-lust, venality, money-grubbing, flamboyance and all other such fevers are nowhere to be found.  Good health abounds..\r\n\r\nI have tried my best to order my life accordingly.   I think I’m living more closely to that ideal now than ever before, here in our “cottage that is a home not a plaything," in a state of repose, with good cookery almost every day.  The gardens are nothing much yet.  We’ve only been here since January.  We are at work on them daily and in time they will flourish.  Willa would approve.\r\n\r\nI am not alone.  My dear friends at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian and at “Leaves of Learning” (the school where I joyfully teach — and gosh, how I miss teaching during the summer break!) and many of you, we all make the same attempt, whether or not we’ve read Willa Cather.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the music I want to share today.  It’s my “Homage to Willa Cather (Harvest Hymn & Harvest Dance), played the musicians for whom I wrote the piece and to whom it is dedicated, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(114,replace(replace('\r\n	How lovely mature elm trees must have been.  \r\n\r\n	I’ve never seen one.  The Dutch elm disease lowered the curtain on them a generation before I was born.  The chestnut exited soon after and, in the last two decades, the hemlock followed.  \r\n\r\n	Forty-five years ago, backpacking in the northern third of Shenandoah National Park, I came upon the Limberlost Trail, celebrated for its giant hemlocks.\r\n\r\n	In 1920, George and Addie Pollock, who were instrumental in the creation of the park, bought the acreage hosting a hundred hemlocks, near their Skyland resort, to save the trees from logging.  George named the area the Limberlost Forest after Gene Stratton Porter''s novel A Girl of the Limberlost.\r\n\r\n	There’s an irony in that.  The Limberlost Swamp was a 13,000 acre wetland in eastern Indiana, a remnant of the period immediately following the last retreat of the glaciers.  It was an incomparable wetland, the Everglades of the Midwest.  You won’t be surprised to learn that, a little more than a hundred years ago, it was completely drained and turned into farmland.  Recently a conservation group has purchased 1500 acres of the area and are trying to recreate a tiny sliver of the once-vast wetlands.\r\n\r\n	George and Addie’s Limberlost Forest, like its namesake, is no more.  When we visited the park as a family, I told our kids about the magical forest, dense and gloomy, that we would enter, the sort of place where you’d expect to encounter Hansel & Gretel or the Big Bad You-know-who.  But when we arrived at the Limberlost Trail, all the hemlocks were gone.  Saved from the loggers, they were felled by an insect, the woolly adelgid.\r\n\r\n	Now America’s eight billion ash trees are facing extinction from another insect.  It appears that each generation experiences the loss of a major tree species.  Those were sorrowful losses but at least they were not the result of human interference with Nature.\r\n\r\n	Not so with the exiting of frogs, butterflies, bees and birds (3 billion less in the US now than in 1970).  And that’s to say nothing of what’s gone missing in the oceans.\r\n\r\n	What’s ahead?  God knows.  Mayhem is too weak a word.\r\n\r\n	The great American playwright Thornton Wilder wrote, “Every good and excellent thing in the world stands moment by moment on the razor-edge of danger and must be fought for.”  He did not anticipate that the world itself, “the great globe and all which it inherit,” would have to be fought for.  \r\n\r\n	This challenge is new and requires of us strenuous energy and epic ingenuity.  It’s that, or despair.\r\n\r\n	I have a scant supply of energy and ingenuity to offer, however desperate the cause.  If I busted myself to save the planet, would it really make any difference?  The levers of power are beyond my reach.  So, then what?  Despair?\r\n\r\n	Despair seems warranted, but despair is not my style, not to my taste.  A state of constant alarm precludes good health and happiness.  I try to strike a balance between activism (I sign petitions, phone my elected officials, insulate my home, carpool, recycle, etc.) and the respite I find in “all things wise and noble.”\r\n\r\n	Namely:  music, poetry, art.  Friendship, gardening, cookery.   Even with my broken ankle, I climb into the hammock I''ve stretched between two ancient pines (not hemlocks) in our backyard almost every day and just swing.  I don’t read, I don’t pore over my laptop, I don’t listen to the radio.  I just swing.  Time in a hammock is time in the bathtub except that the water isn’t gradually getter colder and you don’t have to towel yourself afterwards!\r\n\r\n	One writer I greatly admire is Odell Shepard, who was, among many other things, an ardent dendrophile.  He wrote beautifully about the elms of New England.  If he knew that the species was doomed, he kept silent about it.  \r\n\r\n	I set to music one of his elm-poems, scoring it for SATB chorus and piano.  A few decades later, it grew into the piece for cello and piano which I want to share today.  I will include the poem below in case you want to read it while you are listening to this music.\r\n\r\n	(I particularly love the lines evoking stars peeping through branches:  \r\n\r\n			Snaring the little silver fish\r\n				That swim in her silent sea.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elm Tree\r\n\r\nThe Mountain pine is a man at arms\r\n	With flashing shield and blade,\r\nThe willow is a dowager,\r\n	The birch is a guileless maid,\r\nBut the elm tree is a lady\r\n	In gold and green brocade.\r\n\r\nBroad-bosomed to the meadow breeze\r\n	The matron maple grows,\r\nThe poplar plays the courtesan\r\n	To every wind that blows,\r\nBut who the tall elm’s lovers are\r\n	Only the midnight knows.\r\n\r\nAnd few would ever ask it\r\n	Of such a stately tree,\r\nSo lofty in the moonlight,\r\n	So virginal stands she,\r\nSnaring the little silver fish\r\n	That swim in her silent sea.\r\n\r\nBut hush!  A hum of instruments\r\n	Deep in the night begins;\r\nAlong those dusky galleries\r\n	Low music throbs and thins --\r\nA whispering of harps and flutes\r\n	And ghostly violins.\r\n\r\nFor what mysterious visitor\r\n	Do all her windy bells\r\nRing welcome in the moonlight\r\n	And amorous farewells?\r\nThe elm tree is a lady.\r\n	The midnight never tells.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo hear cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Greg Kostraba performing Elm Trees in Moonlight from October Reveries, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	This perfect little poem by Odell Shepard may be my favorite ...\r\n\r\nThe Town Beyond the Mountain \r\n\r\nThe Town Beyond the Mountain\r\n	Where we have never been,\r\nShines in a sunset glory\r\n	Ineffably serene.\r\n\r\nAbove the small white houses\r\n	Its lofty elms trees blow\r\nA more mysterious music\r\n	Than any trees we know.\r\n\r\nNoon wears the color of eve there,\r\n	And the song of its narrow stream\r\nComes down from a hidden country\r\n	Deep in the hills of dream.\r\n\r\nThere Quietness keeps her dwelling\r\n	And Peace descends like snow\r\nOn the Town Beyond the Mountain ...\r\n	Where we will never go.\r\n\r\n\r\n	It doesn’t mention the time of year but, to me, the final line, so simple, so wistful, lends the poem the feeling of October.  \r\n\r\n	Like autumn, the final line is inevitable and satisfying ... yet we try not to  see it coming.  I find myself thinking, “Maybe this year the leaves will just keep on being green and never leave us.”  Oh well.\r\n\r\nTo hear cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Greg Kostraba performing Where Quietness Keeps Her Dwelling from October Reveries (music which grew out of my setting of this poem as an art song), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\n	Today, October 20, is one of the ‘high feast days’ on the Sowashian liturgical calendar.  It’s the birthday of Charles Ives!\r\n\r\n	Ives is one of my heroes.  HIs portrait hangs on the wall of my ‘cubbyhole’ (my study, a little room comprising the second floor of our 1830 house) along with Henry Thoreau, Theodore Roosevelt, Odell Shepard, Gandalf and Babar the Elephant.  Heroes, all!\r\n\r\n	Ives was tremendously important for me during my early twenties, when I was finding my voice as a composer.  I studied his scores, listened to recordings, visited his home and grave in Danbury, CT, interviewed people who knew him including John Kirkpatrick and Charles Seeger (Pete’s father).\r\n\r\n	Ives was an inspiration and a model for the young Rick Sowash.  Not that I imitated his music.  As Whitman said, "He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.”  \r\n\r\n	Don’t take too seriously that verb “destroy.”  Walt loves to make us gasp, remember.  I did not “destroy” ives in honoring him.  Rather, I kept at bay his penchant for musical experimentalism and his curiosity about dissonance and poly-rhythms and embraced, instead, his determination to write music that was true to his authentic self and to make his way well outside of the musical establishment of his time.  \r\n\r\n	Charles Ives and I both strived to create a music that would express our lives as experienced in a particular geographical location.  South-western Connecticut for Ives, north central Ohio (originally Connecticut’s Western Reserve) for me.\r\n\r\n	We both dismissed pressures to cater to what the mainstream establishment of our respective times was blessing.  In Ives’ day, the musical establishment was conservative;  thus, much of his music was avant garde.  In the 1970’s, when I was coming of age as a composer, the musical establishment embraced serialism, John Cage and the avant garde, pronounced tonality dead;  thus, my music was conservative, tonal, melodic.\r\n\r\n	Ives’ music sounds American.  So does mine.  \r\n\r\n	We both wrote books and were inspired by literature and Nature.  \r\n\r\n	Ives gave away his music to anyone whom he thought might find it interesting;  I do the same.\r\n\r\n	We both married once and for keeps.  We supported our families by working outside the world of music.  Oh, and we both sported white beards; we both favored wool sweaters and hats.\r\n\r\n	That’s a lot to have in common with another composer, even if my music sounds nothing like his.  \r\n\r\n	The writer Odell Shepard was another Connecticut artist at odds with the cultural establishment of his day.  He eschewed the influence of modernist writers like Hemingway and wrote “tonal” prose that was old-fashioned but authentic.  \r\n\r\n	He wrote poems, too, including the following, which served as the basis for the final movement of my “October Reveries” for cello & piano:\r\n\r\nA Spirit dances down the world\r\n  On swift and shining sandals\r\n     Who makes the woods rejoice and spills\r\n    A splendor of flame upon the hills\r\nAnd lights the sumac candles.\r\n\r\nHer clear voice calls my very name --\r\n  Calls, and will have an answer;\r\n    And all my heart is bound away\r\n    Into the colored hills to stray\r\nAfter that hidden dancer.\r\n\r\nFarewell to friend and wife and child\r\n  And all things wise or sober!\r\n    For I have drunk deep of vivid stains\r\n    And feel like magic in my veins\r\nThe wild wine of October.\r\n\r\nTo hear cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Greg Kostraba performing The Wild Wine of October from October Reveries (music which grew out of my setting of this poem as an art song), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),81);

Youthful Love:   “Love Me”\r\n\r\nBrown-thrush singing all day long\r\nIn the leaves above me,\r\nTake my love this April song,\r\n“Love me, love me, love me!”\r\n\r\nWhen he harkens what you say,\r\nBid him, lest he miss me,\r\nLeave his work or leave his play,\r\nAnd kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Unrequited Love:   “Night Song at Amalfi”\r\n\r\nI asked the heaven of stars\r\n    What I should give my love —\r\nIt answered me with silence,\r\n    Silence above.\r\n\r\nI asked the darkened sea\r\n    Down where the fishes go —\r\nIt answered me with silence,\r\n    Silence below.\r\n\r\nOh, I could give him weeping,\r\n    Or I could give him song —\r\nBut how can I give silence\r\n    My whole life long?\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Love at the End:    “Let it be You”\r\n\r\nLet it be you who lean above me \r\nOn my last day,\r\nLet it be you who shut my eyelids \r\nForever and aye.\r\nSay a "Goodnight" as you have said it\r\nAll of these years,\r\nWith the old look, with the old whisper \r\nAnd without tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see and hear these “Three Love Songs” performed by mezzo soprano Megan Potter and pianist Sharon Grimes, copy and paste this link into your browser:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/VYY-xzUvpsI\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy Valentine’s Day --\r\n\r\nRomance?  Not my turf.\r\n\r\nI fell in love when I was seventeen with the gentlewoman to whom I have now been married for 48.5 years.  It’s sweet, marrying your high school sweetheart and living happily ever after, but it’s not much of a story.  A story needs conflict, episodes, heights and depths, adventures, climaxes, a dénoument.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, I have no repertoire of stories about ‘the dating scene,’ “seeing” someone, breaking up, being ‘out there.’ \r\n\r\nStill, Valentine''s Day calls for something Romantic.  You are invited to discover my Three Love Songs, heartfelt settings of brief poems about love by Sarah Teasdale.  They are sung in this recording with great warmth and depth of feeling by Diane Haslam, for whose voice the songs were conceived and to whom the set is dedicated.  You''ll also discover the playing of Phil Amalong, a wonderfully sensitive collaborative pianist.\r\n\r\nThe singing of mezzo-soprano Diane Haslam entered my life when I was mid-way through my composing career.  I wrote fully 28 songs specifically for her.  Too, many of my later instrumental works, especially those featuring the clarinet, were influenced by the gorgeous, almost clarinet-like quality of her rich, dark voice. \r\n\r\nHere are the three poems comprising the Three Love Songs.  Teasdale’s original titles are in quotation marks.\r\n\r\nI.  Youthful Love:  “Love Me”\r\n\r\nBrown thrush singing all day long\r\n in the leaves above me, \r\nTake my love this April song: \r\n"Love me, love me, love me." \r\n\r\nWhen he hearkens what you say, \r\nbid him, lest he miss me, \r\nLeave his work or leave his play\r\nand kiss me, kiss me, kiss me.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Unrequited Love:  “Night Song at Amalfi”\r\n\r\nI asked the heaven of stars, \r\nwhat should I give my love? \r\nIt answered me with silence, silence above. \r\n\r\nI asked the darken''d sea, \r\ndown where the fishers go. \r\nIt answered me with silence, silence below.\r\n \r\nOh, I could give him weeping \r\nor I could give him song. \r\nBut how can I give him \r\nsilence my whole life long?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  Love at the End:  “Let it be You”\r\n\r\nLet it be you who lean above me, \r\non my last day. \r\nLet it be you who shut my eyelids, \r\nforever and aye. \r\n\r\nO, say a "Good night" as you have said it, \r\nall these years, \r\nWith the old look, with the old whisper \r\nand without tears.\r\n\r\nDespite the admonishment to be “without tears,” when the final phrase of that last song unfolds, I weep.  \r\n\r\nI have to smile at myself a little because it reminds me of what Spencer Tracy says in “Adam’s Rib” when Kate Hepburn begins to cry:   \r\n		“Here it comes,” he says, “the Old Juice.”\r\n\r\nTo hear Diane singing Three Love Songs, accompanied by Phil Amalong, click on the link above.    \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),116);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(116,replace(replace('A troublous decade expires.\r\n\r\nLast week, Bret Stephens penned a column for the NYTimes titled “Decade of Disillusion.”   \r\n\r\nHe wrote:  “... this decade has been marked by the intense hostility of the young toward truisms that once governed our thinking.  As they saw it, the liberal international order didn’t uphold the peace — it bled us dry.  Capitalism didn’t make the country rich — it made the rich richer.  Silicon Valley didn’t innovate technology — it mined our data.  The Church didn’t save souls — it raped children.  The cops didn’t serve and protect — they profiled and killed.  The media didn’t tell the news — they spun it.”\r\n\r\nI want to reply, “Not my church, not Mt. Auburn Presbyterian.  And I know good cops who serve and protect.  And what about NPR?”\r\n\r\nBut I find it difficult to take issue with his other assertions.  In fact, I can add a few more disillusions of my own.  Sarah, the mother of a 12-year-old named David, one of my brightest students, told me that the annual fee required of all Boy Scouts has, in the last year, nearly tripled — to $60! -- because the BSA is being bankrupted by law suits arising from accusations of sexual assaults by adult leaders.  Another effect is that all troops undertake a mandatory and explicit training program called “Youth Protection" to ensure that boys and leaders recognize and report sex abuse.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Protection program is obviously essential, healthy and compassionate.  Still, this news about my beloved BSA is disillusioning for an Eagle Scout and one-time Scoutmaster such as myself.  \r\n\r\nMy Scoutmaster, Frank Culp, was as fine a man as I have known.  What would he have thought about this?  He would have deplored the wrongdoing and I think he would have agreed with the necessity of the Youth Protection training.  Of course there was sex abuse in his time, too.  If the issue had been put before him in the abstract, he probably would have told himself that there are always “a few bad apples” and let it go at that.  He never had to deal with the widespread awakening to such horrors that characterizes our time.  He died in 1971 with many illusions intact.  \r\n\r\nCome to think of it, for Mr. Culp ‘impeachment’ was something that only one president had ever brought upon himself.  Andrew Johnson’s impeachment would have seemed a very long time ago to Mr. Culp.  Another rare case of “a bad apple.”  In the years since he went to his reward, we Scouts who were his charge have seen, in effect, three more impeachments of corrupt presidents. \r\n\r\nWhen corruption, venality and lying seem ubiquitous, when we suffer almost hourly reminders of negativity and hate, we become cold.   We must warm ourselves.  How?  By drawing near to what is good and authentic and true. \r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon I bicycled through the fading wintry light to Terrace Park and back, about ten miles.  It was good to be outdoors and to pedal my bike again, letting it carry me yon and hither.  \r\n\r\nWhen I returned, Jo was out-and-about, running errands, so I didn’t come inside the house.  Instead, I built a campfire in the tiny woods at the rear of our property.  \r\n\r\nI’ve constructed a little brick fire circle out there, to shelter the fledgling flickers from the wind.  I''ve placed an old park bench next to the fire circle alongside a pile of the slender, dry kindling Mr. Culp termed “squaw wood.”  (A sexist and racist phrase?  I have to admit it is.  The only defense is to say, “Things were different back then; no offense was intended; people didn’t think in those terms; times have changed and, in some ways, for the better.”)  \r\n\r\nI wish you could join me at my fire circle.  We’d sit, talking seldom, and watch the flames flourish as darkness slowly cloaks the tall pines above us and the sky above them.  The woodsmoke, the crackling noises, the orange glow, the memories of songs sung and stories told round campfires long since extinguished, these are good things.\r\n\r\nMr. Culp used to tell us:  no two campfires are ever alike.  The precise lay of the sticks and the way they ignite are unique, every time.  And the faces round the fire, too, are never the same.  Even if we could reassemble those long lost friends with whom we gathered round the campfires of our youth, they would not be the same.  Time has greatly changed us all, nearly beyond recognition.  \r\n\r\nMr. Culp''s point?  Realizing that no two campfires are ever same makes you relish the moment.  A teaching like that far outshines the use of a mildly pejorative term like ’squaw wood.''\r\n\r\nAfter a while I let the fire burn down, finally dousing it with a splash from my water bottle.  When I stood, the evening star was shining in the western sky, another thing that is good, authentic and true.  And bright with certitude.\r\n\r\nThe star made me remember a piece I wrote many years ago, “Night Thoughts,” and it occurred to me that music, too, is another very good and authentic thing to which we can draw near and find solace and strength and a kind of warmth.\r\n\r\nWhen our daughter, Shenandoah, was a 7th-grader at Cincinnati''s celebrated School for the Creative and Performing Arts, her choir director, Laurie Wyant, led the SCPA Children''s Choir in a superb performance of my “Night Thoughts.”  The tempo Laurie chose was satisfyingly brisk and I love how clearly the child choristers articulate Robert Louis Stevenson’s text and how they convey the spirit of his words!

I might have preferred a comparison to Grant Wood or Thomas Hart Benton, but Grandma Moses was true to her vision and possessed an instantly recognizable American style.  I hope that as much might be said of my best work.\r\n\r\nFor my own amusement, I wrote a set of variations on the tune, keeping it simple  enough for me to play on my soprano recorder, titling it, whimsically, "Variations on a Tune by Grandma Moses."  The tune being hymn-like, I set up my music stand in the center aisle of my church one Sunday morning and played the variations during the Offertory.\r\n\r\nThen I thought I should find some words to sing with this hymn-like tune so that it could actually serve as a hymn.  I found a versified setting of Psalm 23 that fell into place with the rhythms of the music.  Then I expanded the hymn into an anthem for four-part choir and piano titled "Emerald Fields."\r\n\r\nIn the process, I cooked up a few more variations and rescored the Grandma Moses Variations for solo clarinet.\r\n\r\nMy various works for unaccompanied instruments are getting attention these days when musicians find themselves in confinement.

Celebrated today for his remarkable paintings of birds, he lived in obscurity for a time in Cincinnati; there is a statue of him just across the river in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nOur public library has a first edition of his famous “The Birds of America,”\r\n-- 435 hand-coloured, life-size prints, measuring about 39 by 26 inches and including images of a half dozen birds now extinct. \r\n\r\nI sought musical expressions that would evoke the images such a film would offer:  there would be close-ups of Audubon’s paintings but also live-action shots of birds rising from wetlands or flying in v-formation.  There would be shots suggesting the vast American wilderness and portraits of Audubon himself, conveying his rugged energy and idealism.  I was excited!  I got to work.\r\n\r\nThen my involvement in the film project was suddenly terminated.  The preliminary drafts I submitted were not to the liking of the producer.  He was very kind about it, even apologetic.  But the music I was creating was not what he wanted for the film.  He sent me a generous “kill fee.”  Oh well.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my friend and fan, clarinetist Joe Rosen, had been pestering me to write a wind octet he could premiere with his friends at WindFest, an annual gathering of wind players in Canada.  What''s more, Joe is a bird-lover and a great admirer of Audubon.  I redirected my ideas for the Audubon film score into a new wind octet.  \r\n\r\n(The wind octet is a curious ensemble:  pairs of oboes, clarinets, French horns and bassoons.  Mozart, Schubert and Dvorak wrote music for that combination; Mozart''s octet is considered one of his greatest works.)\r\n\r\nThus came into being my octet,  "Audubon," a musical homage to an heroic artist and frontiersman.

You must have noticed. \r\n\r\nThe calendar seems to have almost stopped.  One homebound day slips into the next, like those blank days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve.\r\n\r\nA friend confessed that, rather than remembering what day it is, he just calls every day “Schmursday.”  \r\n\r\nI’d have thought that a long string of empty days would move more slowly, that the stretch from noon to nightfall would feel like a week, as it did when I was a boy and every hour seemed filled with limitless possibilities.  Quite the opposite.  I’ll think it’s early afternoon until I chance to glance at a clock and find that it’s time to start cooking supper.\r\n\r\nHunkering down together in a home we love is not unpleasant.  We do a little yardwork, assemble jigsaw puzzles, ride the bike trail, take a nap, figure out supper, do the dishes, watch good TV when we can find it.   Last night we finished Padma Lakschmi’s “Taste of the Nation,” which was excellent.  The series scratches the travel itch and made me hunger for something cooked by someone other than me.\r\n\r\nI haven’t set foot in my church or school for a hundred days.  Likely, three or four hundred more days will pass before I can prance, posture and pontificate in the classroom or sing in my beloved church choir, things I very much do miss doing.  \r\n\r\nI am taking an unpaid sabbatical from my teaching until there is a vaccine. \r\n\r\nFor the first time since I was three years old, my calendar is completely empty.  Back in 1954, my first day of school was about fifteen months in the future.  Same thing now.  Maybe longer.\r\n\r\nThe situation frees me to take up again some of the things I used to do when I was a boy.  I still have the wooden blocks my dad made for me and I have been thinking of passing some time building structures with them on the floor in our cool and quiet basement.  There’s a wide open space on the floor down there that calls for a castle.  I have a yen to paint toy soldiers. \r\n\r\nWe devote much time to following the news.  It is a season of sad crises.  I feel a little ashamed to find myself reasonably happy when so many are suffering so much grief, shock and depression.  There’s the virus, jobs lost, long lines at food kitchens, and an intense and troubled awakening to the misery of our fellow citizens who suffer the results of the racism our culture has sanctioned for so long.  \r\n\r\nThe collapse of our standing internationally troubles me, too.  I’m still proud of the achievements of the greatest of my fellow Americans.  I could look my French friends in the eye and say, “Tu as donné au monde Victor Hugo, Debussy et Monet, oui, et je te remercie.  Mais nous avons donné Walt Whitman, Louis Armstrong et Georgia O’Keefe.”\r\n\r\nI am still proud of our national parks.  I’m still proud of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence but I am also shamed by those documents, given how far short we’ve fallen from realizing the ideals expressed so explicitly therein.   \r\n\r\nOur progress toward ‘a more perfect union’ is faltering worse than ever and the whole world knows it.  As David Brooks wrote in the NYTimes yesterday, “We Americans enter the July 4 weekend of 2020 humiliated as almost never before.”\r\n\r\nAnd to think that another hundred thousand Americans will likely die from this virus before winter.  Who knows how many more will follow?  \r\n\r\nWhat are we to make of the death threats and armed harrassment that our fellow citizens are visiting upon the very public health leaders who are trying to protect us, forcing many of them to resign so as to protect their families?  What kind of a culture breeds idiots who are capable of such things?  \r\n\r\nRemember when you-know-who said he didn’t want people coming to the USA from “s--thole countries”?  Now that we have far the highest number of infections in the world, many countries don’t want us coming to them.  Who is the “s--thole country” now?\r\n\r\nWhat can one do?  I phone my Congress people.  But I’ve done that all my adult life and never felt that any good came of it.

And, as everyone knows, our first eight presidents owned slaves.\r\n\r\nAs we remove them from their pedestals, or at least lower the elevation of the pedestals on which they’ve perched, with whom shall we replace them?\r\n\r\nWhich historical figures shall populate our nation’s literal and figurative memorial landscape?  Is there no one whose memory we can cherish without fear that they did or said something that will diminish our admiration of them?\r\n\r\nThere is.  John Chapman, for one, the pioneer orchardman better known as Johnny Appleseed.  I’d like to see a John Chapman National Monument erected and planted (the grounds must feature an apple orchard, not just a statue) in Ohio where Johnny undertook the bulk of his life’s work.\r\n\r\nKids growing up in Mansfield, Ohio, as I did in the 1950’s, knew all about Johnny Appleseed.  Johnny''s name was in lots of places around town. \r\n\r\nThere was the: \r\n-- Johnny Appleseed Junior High School (where my cousins went),\r\n-- Johnny Appleseed Boy Scout Council (of which my troop was a part),\r\n-- Johnny Appleseed Shopping Center (in the parking lot of which I learned to ride a bicycle), 	\r\n-- Johnny Appleseed Realty (through which my parents bought our home),\r\n-- Johnny Appleseed Coffee Shop in the Leland Hotel (where my Grandma sometimes took me to lunch).  \r\n\r\nThe Johnny Appleseed Historic Byway connects Loudonville and Mansfield.\r\n\r\nThere is even a small, tombstone-looking monument to Johnny Appleseed in Mansfield’s South Park, next to the historic Blockhouse, a two-story log structure built in the pioneer days to defend the fledgling community.\r\n\r\nWe all knew how Johnny, during the War of 1812, saved Mansfield from an Indian attack by running, alone, thirty miles south to Mount Vernon.  He convinced the soldiers stationed there to hurry back with him to Mansfield.  With Johnny scouting the path ahead, the soldiers marched quickly and arrived in the nick of time.  Seeing the soldiers, the Indians withdrew.  \r\n\r\nFor Mansfielders, this was the most important chapter in the life story of Johnny Appleseed.  What’s better remembered everywhere else in America is that he planted apple trees so that the pioneers, newly arrived in the wilderness, would find encouragement:  fruit already weighing burgeoning on the boughs.  \r\n\r\nApples were the only domestic fruit available on the frontier and the pioneers used them in myriad ways.  They made apple butter, apple sauce, apple pies and cider.  The ran string through apples and hung them up to dry, eating them months later.  They wrapped apples in burlap and buried them in the dirt floors of their cabin homes, digging them up months later, finding them still crunchy and edible.  \r\n\r\nThere was ‘hard’ cider, too, but most importantly, the pioneers rendered  vinegar from the juice of Johnny’s apples and used it to pickle vegetables, preserving them for eating during the long, cold Ohio winters, when gardens lay fallow and buried in snow.\r\n\r\nWe knew the facts about him.  John Chapman was his real name and he lived from 1774 until 1845.  It said so, right there on his monument.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me that Johnny Appleseed could be dismissed as a fictional character.  When I left Ohio to go to college I met students from other parts of the country who thought our hero was “just made up.”  That was a shock.  Even those who knew he was an historical figure didn’t revere him the way we did back home.  \r\n\r\nBut they certainly had heard of him.  He may be the best-known of our American folk heroes; every first grader has at least heard of Johnny Appleseed.  \r\n\r\nThough a real person, Johnny also became a mythic figure.  The notion that he went barefoot and dressed in rags (true) and went about wearing a metal cooking pot on his head (false) have rendered him slightly ridiculous.  Unfair.  Pioneer diaries and letters mention Johnny’s unusual headgear --  hats of his own making with a broad front brim to shield his eyes from the sun -- but none specify a cooking pot.\r\n\r\nStill, we will always think of Johnny as raggedy, barefoot and wearing a pot on his head.  The image befits a saint.  The pot is an “attribute.”  St. Peter holds the keys;  St. Christopher carries the baby Jesus piggyback; St. Cecilia holds a musical instrument; St. Johnny wears a pot on his head.\r\n\r\nJohnny IS a saintly figure.  Deeply religious, he practiced and preached his cherished Swedenborgianism to anyone who would listen, handing out pamphlets to all and sunder.  He may have thought of himself as an American version of John the Baptist, a spiritual non-conformist, a prophet more focused on the future than the present, a voice in a literal wilderness. \r\n\r\nThe pioneers loved him, eccentricities and all.  Dr. Betty Reed, who met the medical needs of rural Richland County for over sixty years, told me the story passed along in her family:  her ancestors welcomed Johnny but asked him to sleep in the barn, “because, you know, he didn’t smell very good."\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans honored him, understanding his eccentricities as a sign that he was ‘tetched,’ God-kissed.  They accepted him as he was and he accepted them and their hospitality. \r\n\r\nA National Monument would deepen our understanding of him, his life’s work, the example he set. \r\n\r\nHe is just about our only non-violent American folk hero.  Think about it.  American folk heroes are a rough and tumble lot, human dynamos, victorious in a vortex of violence, whether its Paul Bunyan felling old growth forests or Dave Crockett falling at the Alamo.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, here''s our Johnny -- a nurturer!  His energy is quiet.  He favors slow growth:  he establishes and tends apple orchards.  Our kinda guy, right?  Let’s erect a monument and plant an orchard to honor him.\r\n\r\nI’ve given talks about Johnny to historical societies and in schools.  He is Chapter One in my book, “Heroes of Ohio.”  I wrote and starred in a half-hour documentary film about him.  I impersonated Johnny at hundreds of Ohio elementary schools and for fourteen weeks at “Apple Fest” presented by the Heritage Village in Cincinnati’s Sharon Woods Park.  That’s right.  I went barefoot, wor raggedy clothes and bright red suspenders and a cooking pot on my head. \r\n\r\nWe even named our son after him:  John Chapman Sowash.  His friends call him Chapman.  We call him Chap, for short.  When he was little, he was our Chappy.  I miss that little guy.\r\n\r\nEvery year on the Sunday closest to Johnny''s birthdate — September 26 —I speak up during the part of our church service we call ''Prayers of the People,'' giving thanks for the life, contributions and example of Johnny Appleseed, America’s best-known non-violent folk hero and the unofficial patron saint of the Buckeye State.\r\n\r\nI’ve written several songs and choral works about J.A., as well as a duo for violin and cello entitled “A Suite of Virtues:  A Tribute to John Chapman.”  There are seven movements, each evoking one the old-fashioned virtues I believe Johnny possessed:  \r\n	I. Optimism,\r\n	II. Enterprise, \r\n	III.  Perseverance, \r\n	IV.  Certitude, \r\n	V.  Soulfulness, \r\n	VI.  Joyfulness, and \r\n	VII.  Faith.\r\n\r\nThe suite has not been professionally recorded.  A couple of months ago I asked the violinists and cellists among you, my friends and fans, if they might like to make an amateur recording of one of the movements and send it to me as an mp3 so that I could share it with y’all.  A number responded and I assigned a movement to each duo.  Now, the recordings, often made in a livingroom with a cell phone, are starting to arrive.\r\n\r\nToday I want to share the final movement, “Faith,” a virtue J.A. had in abundance.  His faith is best displayed in a story his biographer, Robert Price, recounts in “Johnny Appleseed:  Man and Myth.”  Johnny had departed from Pittsburgh in a canoe, heading west on the Ohio river with a cargo of apple seeds.  He got the seeds, for free, from the city’s makers of hard cider.  Eager to return to the headwaters of the Muskingum, where the bulk of his orchards were, Johnny did not allow the coming of night to slow his progress.  Instead of wasting eight hours by camping alongside the river, he pulled his canoe onto an ice floe and made his bed upon the bags of appleseeds in it.  With never a moment’s worry about snags, rocks or rapids, with the stars overhead and resting in the certititude that we’re all in God’s Hands, he slept soundly until dawn.\r\n\r\nNow, that displays an admirable faith, both energetic and serene.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Faith” performed with energy and serenity by violinist Jennifer Dunn and her cellist friend Heidi Nagel, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),169);

Auburn Presbyterian Church.  \r\n\r\nWe were really good!  Twenty-five strong, many with considerable experience in music theatre, opera, jazz and classical music.  \r\n\r\nThe Music Minister, Chris Miller, inspired us and cared about us.  We choristers cared about one another, too; we knew what was going on in each other''s lives because at the end of our rehearsals we shared ‘joys and concerns.’  Chris incorporated into a prayer and ended rehearsals by reading a poem.  Singing in the choir nourished us.\r\n\r\nIt will nourish us again someday, but who knows when?  The memory of it nourishes us now.\r\n\r\nI wrote many hymns and anthems for our congregation.  Today I want to share a video version of one of the anthems, assembled by Gordon DeVinney, a much-loved and admired member of MAPC.  The recording was made when our choir participated in a concert of my choral music about ten years ago but the visuals were assembled by Gordon just last month and Gordon’s video was shared with our congregation during a recent on-line worship service.\r\n\r\nThe lyrics are by Cincinnati poet W.B. “Bucky” Ignatius, a long-time friend of the congregation and a tenor in the choir.  The title, “We’ve Come to Know,” converys two ideas: ‘we’ve gradually realized something”  AND  ‘we’ve arrived and joined together to find out something.’ \r\n\r\nBucky was careful, at my suggestion, to devise lyrics with singable vowels, avoiding the gnarly vowels that are unpleasant to sing.  Bucky told me that he had never before imposed this limitation upon himself.  He had considered the meanings of words principally, their vowels not so much. \r\n\r\nLook how beautifully he met the challenge:\r\n\r\nWe’ve Come to Know\r\n	by W.B. Ignatius\r\n\r\nYour loving hand is found, oh Lord, \r\nin every dawning day.\r\nYou bring us calm and gently balm \r\nour wounds and guide us on our way.\r\n\r\nWith just and perfect balance, Lord, \r\nwith love in all You do, \r\nforever near, You stand to hear \r\nand help all those who come to You.\r\n\r\nJoin hands, good people, everywhere,\r\nwhoever you may be, \r\nall children of the God within\r\nare surely kin to me.\r\n\r\nFrom near and distant shores awake,\r\nwherever waters flow.\r\nOur hearts we raise to sing your praise. \r\nYour love we’ve come to know.\r\n\r\nI featured an oboe in collaboration with the choir, instead of the usual piano or organ accompaniment.  In striking contrast to the choral sonority, the piercing sound of the oboe frames the music that is sung by the choir.  In the prologue, the oboe offers ideas, “teaching” them to the choir.  The choir develops the ideas while the oboe comments, like a loving teacher.  The oboe offers a blessing, a benediction and, at the very end, a farewell.\r\n\r\nI love Gordon’s choices of video imagery.  Assembling a ‘youtube’ is a skill I admire but do not possess.  Do you have this skill?  If any of you know how to create a ‘youtube’ and would like to combine your choices of video images with my music, let me know.  I’ll send you an mp3 recording of one of my pieces and we can email back and forth about possible imagery.  It would be fun and something to do.  We’ll put your video up as a youtube and I’ll share the link with my “friends and fans” via my weekly emails, as I am doing today with Gordon’s work.

Compensation arrived in other ways, shapes and forms.\r\n\r\nTo wit, nine days in San Diego!  In 2014, an enthusiastic group of amateur musicians invited us to San Diego.  They even paid for our flights.  Clarinetist Jim Reed loaned us a car and cellist Ed Annavedder, put us up in the guest quarters of his home.  All so that I could be on hand to attend a couple of rehearsals and take a bow after a free, public library performance of “Daweswood,” one of my best chamber works.  \r\n\r\nWhat a time we had!  Two days at fabulous Balboa park, where the famous San Diego zoo is located.  Ed, a member of board, gave us free passes.  \r\n\r\nWe hiked in Anza-Borrego and Torrey Pines State Parks, toured the mission where the ‘50’s TV series “Zorro” (which I loved as a kid) was filmed, checked out La Jolla, Mt. Palomar, the Lagoons of San Diego County and much else.  \r\n\r\nWhen our return flight lifted off, we saw the gray shapes of whales browsing the pale green kelp forests in the blue bay below.\r\n\r\nHow can a composer say ‘thank you’ for such a gift?  With music!\r\n\r\nOur host, Ed, though a cellist, had recently taken up the trumpet as a side-interest.  When he mentioned that he was looking for duos he could play with his ‘cute’ trumpet instructor, I started writing a piece for him.  I had my computer along and popped out one short movement early each morning while Jo was still asleep.  \r\n\r\nNot entirely from scratch, mind you.  I’m good but I’m not that good.  Most were rescorings and expansions of short vocal pieces I had already written.  It was fun to reconceive the tunes, rendering them suitable for instruments.  \r\n\r\nEd’s observations about music guided my energy.\r\n\r\n“Why does so much new ‘classical’ music have to be so difficult?” he asked, not unreasonably.  “How about a fun piece in good old C major -- with no pesky accidentals or annoying meter changes?”\r\n\r\nA juicy challenge!  My response was the canonic movement I titled, for obvious reasons, “Echoes.”  No accidentals, no meter changes.\r\n\r\nSix movements in all, the suite needed a title.  Ed suggested, “Trumpet Talk.”  I liked the title and Ed liked the music.  Win-win.\r\n\r\nMy friends Chris Miller and Ken Rahn recorded the suite in the resonant social hall at Mt. Auburn Presby.  Then Gordon DeVinney,  who has an enviable knack for video art, fashioned an eye-popping video with “Echoes” as the score.

I try to remind myself of the larger, unchanging realities of Nature and to calibrate my response.\r\n\r\nConsider this bald fact, dryly expressed:   “Organisms are relatively transient entities through which materials and energy flow and eventually return to the environment.” \r\n\r\nNo argument there.  It’s an unassailable truth.\r\n\r\nIt’s a scientific-sounding way of saying that “the great Globe itself and all which it inherit shall dissolve.”  \r\n\r\nIt’s a way of asserting that “every flower and face and thought that I have known, together with all that my fellows have thought and dreamed and made” will, as a matter of indisputable fact, “return to the environment.”\r\n\r\nHow shall the wise respond to such truths?  \r\n\r\nShall we passively, merely observe?\r\n\r\nShall we weep because everything transient?  \r\n\r\nOr shall we rejoice at the endless flow of “materials and energy?”  \r\n\r\nWhen we come upon the phrase, “All flesh is grass” in the book of Ecclesiastes, we recall Brahms'' great, dark setting in his German Requiem, the climactic moment when the four-part chorus, eschewing counterpoint, sings in unison, with inexorable force:  "Denn alles Fleisch, es ist wie Gras."  \r\n\r\nIt’s a bitter pill.  We’re all just grass, cut down, thrown into the fire,  consumed and forgotten.  \r\n\r\nAh, but there is another, opposing way to regard that short phrase.  \r\n\r\nWalt Whitman announces it in Section 6 of his “Song of Myself”:\r\n\r\n	“The smallest sprout [of grass] shows there is really no death,\r\n	And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,\r\n	And ceas''d the moment life appear''d.\r\n	All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\r\n	And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.”\r\n\r\nRead aloud those lines at my funeral!\r\n\r\nWhitman inherited that notion from good old Heraclitus.\r\n\r\nThis ancient Greek philosopher believed in the unity of opposites and harmony in the world.  He was famous for his insistence on ever-present change as the characteristic feature of the world, as stated in the famous saying, “everything flows.”\r\n\r\nWhen Heraclitus says, “All flesh is grass,” he is smiling, joyfully affirming the unending cycles of life.  He is saying, "Just think!  All flesh is grass!  Isn’t that amazing?  How splendid!"\r\n\r\nI set to music the following fragment, one of Heraclitus’ few surviving writings:\r\n\r\n	"All flesh is grass.  \r\n	The rain falls, the springs are fed, the streams are filled and flow to the sea.  \r\n	The mist rises from the deep and the clouds are formed and break on the sides of the mountains.  \r\n	The plant enfolds the air, water and salts, and with the aid of the sun, expands by vital alchemy into the bread of life, enfolding this into itself.  		Animals eat plants and a new incarnation begins.  \r\n	All flesh is grass."\r\n\r\nIn my setting, each line is presented and repeated with the next line layered over top of it until, just as in Nature, all the phenomena are happening at once in an exhilarating jumble.  Then the texture thins and clarity returns.  Then, again, in keeping with the rhythms of Nature, complexity returns.  And then comes clarity once more.  The piece ends as simply and quietly as it began:  all flesh is grass.\r\n\r\nGrass being incarnated as flesh, and vice versa, I titled the piece "Incarnation." \r\n\r\nTo hear a fine performance (it begins and ends very quietly; turn up your volume) by the Cincinnati Camerata under the direction of Chris Miller, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),24);

Ben feels more like a Founding Uncle. \r\n\r\nPractical, humorous, shrewd, wise, sexy, and despite his gravitas, slightly absurd, with his bifocals and long, straight hair, his dignified vest billowing across that capacious belly.  When in the Louvre, coming unexpectedly upon Houdon''s famous grinning bust of him, I burst out laughing.  It was a joy to set eyes upon that American face in Paris, a city he adored.\r\n\r\nA man of parts!  Inventor, philosopher, scientist, printer, autobiographer, purveyor of proverbs, Francophile, signer of the Declaration of Independence, framer of the Constitution.  \r\n\r\nHe had a lively interest in music, too.  Inventor of the glass harmonica, he played many instruments, including the guitar, harp, and viola da gamba.  \r\n\r\nHe may have tried his hand at composing, may have penned the manuscript of an odd string quartet with the composer’s name indicated only as “Francklin, ”that turned up in Paris some years back.  He doesn’t mention it in his letters so we can’t be sure if it’s his.\r\n\r\nA sometime music critic, he greatly admired Scottish folksongs, regarding them as more “natural” expressions than the classical music of his time.  When his brother Peter wrote a song, Ben sent him an encouraging letter, saying, "I like your ballad, and think it well adapted for your purpose of discountenancing expensive foppery, and encouraging industry and frugality."\r\n\r\nDoesn’t that sound like something Uncle Ben would say?\r\n\r\nBen’s sincerity, wisdom and ‘discountenance of expensive foppery’ shine through every line of his beautiful and moving "Prayer of Thanks," which I set to music:\r\n\r\n	For peace and liberty, for food and raiment, for corn and wine and milk and daily bread, for every wholesome nourishment, I thank thee, Good God, I thank thee. \r\n	For all the benefits of air and sunshine, for useful fire, and water pure, for every element of life, I thank thee, Good God, I thank thee. \r\n	For art and books and music, for useful and curious knowledge, for the prosperity of my friends and for the fewness of my foes, I thank thee, Good God, I thank thee. \r\n	For all the benefits, for life and reason, for use of speech, for health and strength and joy, for every pleasant hour I spend, I thank thee, Good God, I thank thee.\r\n\r\nWhen Chris Miller, founder and director of Cincinnati''s esteemed October Festival Choir, invited me to write a piece for the group, Ben’s “Prayer of Thanks” seemed especially appropriate.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to write a big, stirring, optimistic, American-sounding piece that a large, volunteer community chorus could enthusiastically embrace, learn and sing.  A piece that would appeal to “the better angels of our nature.”  A high-minded piece, expressing the larger unity behind our religious and political differences. \r\n\r\nGiven the choir''s limited rehearsal time, it had to be easy enough to be quickly learned.  Too, it had to feel "big" without being too long.  Fortunately, the musical forces accompanying the choir that year included a 25-piece brass choir with timpani.  Talk about a big sound!\r\n\r\nI asked for orchestral chimes as well so that the repeated bell sound that opens and closes the piece would remind listeners of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, the city where Franklin thrived.\r\n\r\nI later made a version for solo singer and piano so that the piece can be performed without the brass, timpani and chimes.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(130,replace(replace('Here’s a musical discovery, music few have heard:  the newly-made premiere recording of my Sonata for Violin & Piano, composed 1971-74. \r\n\r\nRobert Bonham is a TN pianist who plays in a piano trio which calls itself Trillium, a lovely name.  After Trillium performed my trios, Robert kindly inquired about my works for violin & piano, or cello & piano.  When he learned that my violin sonata had never been recorded, Robert and his violinist associate Alison Maerker Garner undertook the endeavor.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the sprawling epic of Western civilization, my violin sonata is less consequential than a lightning bug, it’s an important piece for me.  In writing of this sonata, especially the final movement, I found my voice, gave myself permission to be myself.  It was the last composition of my youth and the first of my maturity, a milestone.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear the influences of Hindemith and Bartok in this sonata, a direct quote from Bach’s Invention in D minor and an “Alleluia” we sang in the Lutheran church in which I grew up.  You’ll hear it in the high, hovering violin at 1:15.  It was an Ivesian way of acknowledging my roots.  \r\n\r\nIves is the chiefmost influence in this work:  the abrupt changes, the sudden drops and rises from fff to ppp … the feeling of music freely improvised  … the quasi-ragtime syncopations … bi-tonality here and there … and a masculine quality.  \r\n\r\nIves was a major influence on my character and career … but I think that this is the ONLY piece of mine that shows Ives’ musical influence.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe sonata owes much to Charles Ives; in my early twenties I made a close study of Ives’ life, writings and music.  I saw his home in West Reading, CT, visited his grave in Danbury, read his epitaph (from Psalm 108: “Awake, psaltery and harp, and I myself will awake right early.”), met people who had known him, including John Kirkpatrick and Charles Seeger (father of Pete, who looked just like his famous son).  \r\n\r\nI even got my hair cut by the barber who had trimmed the fringes round the bald pate of Ives’ friend and fellow curmudgeon, Vermont composer Carl Ruggles.  The barber told me, laughing, “Carl used to say, ‘I been busy, revisin’ my shit-list.’  And he had one, too! -- a mile long!”\r\n\r\nNew Englanders.  They’re different than Midwesterners.  \r\n\r\nLate one rainy afternoon, we pulled up at an historic New England village inn, an 18th-century structure with a big front porch.  An old timer was ensconced there in a rocking chair; I don’t think he was a guest, just a character who lived in the village.  I got out of the car, dashed through the downpour and up the front steps.  I nodded at the fellow, friendly-like, the way Midwesterners do.  “Think it’s gonna stop raining?” I asked.  He regarded me for a moment, then slowly pronounced, “Wahl, it always has.”\r\n\r\nAll my life I’ve liked ‘old guys.’  And now, at long last, I am one!  \r\n\r\nThe sonata has the tang of lean, late November.  A friend observed, “It seems rather sparse compared to your more mature music, more a line drawing than an oil painting.”  That’s true.  The musical lines are like bare, black branches penciled across a darkling gray sky.\r\n\r\nThe sonata opens with a probing introduction, marked “coldly.”   At 2:26 the music turns lively but never warm.\r\n\r\nThen comes the slow middle movement.  My later slow movements are lush and neo-Romantic.  Not this one.  Immature, I felt I must be dispassionate and dark.  \r\n\r\nI was wary of writing music that was just plain beautiful, let alone light-hearted, bucolic or funny.  In those days, I took myself seriously!  The second movement is marked “bitterly.”  But it’s only 1:44 long.\r\n\r\nI hope you aren’t put off by the first two movements.  They are a ‘set-up.’ They create a hunger for what the life-affirming third movement offers.  Marked “exuberantly,” the third movement conveys most of what the sonata has to say. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing this piece in 1974, having come to understand how Ives had embraced his New Englander identity and expressed it in music, I was ready to embrace and express my own Midwesterner identity.\r\n\r\nReady, yes, but still with much to learn.  In those days, I jammed too many good ideas into too short a duration of time.  I didn’t much bother with developing my ideas.  I can remember watching myself compose, so to speak, congratulating myself as I went along:  “Wow!  What a great idea!  And now, quick, here’s another great idea.  And if you thought THAT was a great idea, well, here’s another one and just wait until you hear the one that’s coming up next…”  \r\n\r\nI would jam twenty ideas into a half-dozen measures.  \r\n\r\nI exaggerate.  But it’s true that I was slow to learn the value of exploring an idea at some length before offering a contrasting idea.  Giving an idea enough time to fully blossom is one of the secrets of writing good music in any style and the same goes for prose.  When I revised the sonata in 2005, I gave the ideas a little more breathing space.\r\n\r\nIn these weekly emails I usually share an mp3 of one movement from a mutli-movement work.  But this sonata only makes sense when all three movements are heard in sequence.  So I’m inviting you to stick with me through all three movements, a 12-minute journey, worthy, I hope, of your time and attention.\r\n\r\nFor me, hearing this piece so masterfully by Alison Maerker Garner and Robert Bonham is moving, exciting, strange and wonderful.

I was joking.  The title is only funny if you’re in on the joke:  if anyone DID write a piece in the outrageously remote, difficult and all-but-theoretical key of C flat minor, then apologizing to the musician who might attempt to play it would be the least the composer could do to make amends.  The third, sixth and seventh degrees of the scale would be double flats.  Imagine what the key signature would look like with three double-flats indicated!  Such a key would be the relative minor of E double flat major!  The musical theoretician’s mind reels.\r\n\r\nThe not-exactly-classical composer Peter Schickele, a.k.a. PDQ Bach, has blessed us with many funny titles.  Among the best are:\r\n\r\n		The 1712 Overture\r\n		Concerto for Piano vs. Orchestra\r\n		Fanfare for the Common Cold\r\n		Pervertimento for Bagpipe, Bicycle and Balloons\r\n		Toot Suite for Calliope Four Hands\r\n		The “Unbegun” Symphony\r\n\r\nSchickele is a comic genius, a living national treasure.  But these are not serious pieces of classical music, needless to say. \r\n\r\nAs for album titles, my vote for the funniest goes to Schickele’s forebear and acknowledged influence, the great Spike Jones.  I refer to Spike’s LP:\r\n\r\n		“Dinner Music for People Who Aren’t Very Hungry”\r\n\r\nNow THAT is funny.\r\n\r\nHumorous titles come easier to authors.  My vote for the funniest book title goes to Robert Benchley’s anthology of his own humorous writings:\r\n\r\n		“My Ten Years in a Quandary and How They Grew”\r\n\r\nTry to think it through.  Your brain goes ping-pong.\r\n\r\nVery nearly as funny are these titles of books by the incomparable P.G. Wodehouse:\r\n\r\n		“Leave it to Psmith”\r\n		“Aunts Aren’t Gentlemen”\r\n		“Love Among the Chickens”\r\n		“Eggs, Beans and Crumpets”\r\n\r\n“Psmith.”  Who knew that psilent letters were phunny?  Maybe I should call myself “Wrick Psowash.”\r\n\r\nLet us honor, too, Jerome K. Jerome’s classic:\r\n\r\n		“Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the dog)”\r\n\r\nNone of my books have funny titles and of my 400 musical compositions, only one has a title that might -- I say ‘might’ -- be funny:\r\n\r\n		“10 Versions of the Same Stupid Tune”\r\n\r\nThe tune itself is not especially funny.  It means no harm.  It’s just a little too straightforward, square, a tad too earnest and correct.  It’s original, but not very.  Like something from the filmscore of a “B Western.”  If the title is funny, it’s because we composers are a prideful lot -- few would be so unprideful as to label one of their own creations “stupid.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that Beethoven detested the little tune he stole from Diabelli to develop into a stupendous set of keyboard variations.  Never was so much done with so little.  He didn’t derogate the tune by calling it ‘stupid’ in the title.  \r\n\r\nWell, I did, so there.  But I don’t hate the tune.  I’d say to it:  “You’re likable enough.”\r\n\r\nThe ten versions are sweet in their willingness to make damfools of themselves for a laugh.  Some might say the same is true of the composer.\r\n\r\nTo hear Chris Miller playing my Ten Versions of the Same Stupid Tune, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),172);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(132,replace(replace('When, in 1999, as a high school senior, our daughter enrolled in an Art History course, she was required to purchase a hefty art history book containing hundreds of photos of celebrated paintings and sculptures.   \r\n\r\nSmack in the middle, pictured on opposite pages, were photos of Stonehenge and Serpent Mound.  The blue skies behind them emphasized their commonality, two ancient, mysterious works of architectural art.  I thought, how appropriate to display them side by side.  Serpent Mound is a North American twin to Stonehenge.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that, “seein’ as how” I am an Ohio composer, I ought to write a piece about Serpent Mound, the most beautiful and best known of Ohio’s many ancient earthworks.\r\n\r\nCan music really be “about” something other than itself?\r\n\r\nIt’s a perennial debate.  I’ve written plenty of “program music,” i.e. instrumental works that attempt to render an extra-musical narrative or notion described in the piece''s title and program notes, inviting listeners to imagine correlations to the music as they listen.  \r\n\r\nWhere’s the harm in that?  A programmatic title may give listeners an entrée to the music which a generic title, such as “Prelude in F sharp minor,” could not provide.\r\n\r\nMy piece about Serpent Mound is, in fact, in F sharp minor and ‘Prelude’ is just a generic term.  Either title would serve.  But which title do YOU find more intriguing:  “Serpent Mound” or “Prelude in F sharp minor”?\r\n\r\nAs a composer, I know which title is more inspiring.\r\n\r\nProgram music works the other way about, too:  extra-musical entities can inspire music.  I asked myself, “What would a piece of musc that was titled ‘Serpent Mound’ sound like?”  Ideas began to flow.\r\n\r\nThe resulting piece is a soliloquy on a squiggly motif, a slithery, four-note, descending musical shape, a serpentine shape, if you will.  \r\n\r\nI wanted the music to have a wintry mood, evoking the famous effigy mound as seen during a light snowfall, prompting us to ponder its mystery:  we will never know why it was built.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the final cadence is ambiguous:  is the final chord major or minor?  The ending is a metaphor for our conjectures about the Serpent Mound, which must ever remain … conjectures.\r\n\r\nWe have a few facts.  Archaeologists generally agree that it was constructed around 1066, perhaps in response to the most dramatic appearance of Halley’s comet in recorded History.  The striking appearance the comet made in that time around is even depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, with people looking up at it, pointing and gesturing in wonder or horror.  Looking back after William the Conqueror’s invasion and conquest of Anglo-Saxon Britain, the appearance of the comet was understood as a portent.\r\n\r\nIn America, perhaps because the comet streamed across the night sky with a long tail behind it, the ancient moundbuilders may have taken it to be a giant celestial snake.  Given that their cosmology apparently featured a sort of snake-god, they might have felt prompted by the appearance of the comet to build the giant, serpentine mound; it is a quarter mile long.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps they hoped to honor or appease what might have understood to be a rapidly approaching, possibly menacing, potentially devastating god.  Perhaps they believed that, by building the Serpent Mound, they could dissuade the giant serpent from destroying the world they knew; perhaps they thought that they were saving the world from destruction.  If that was their intention then, by their lights, the plan worked:  as the effigy took shape, the comet faded, the celestial snake-god retreated, and the world was saved.  \r\n\r\n(Reminded daily that humans are destroying the world, we might envy the moundbuilders’ possible belief that, by building the Serpent Mound in the nick of time, they had saved the world.)\r\n\r\nThe world-saving notion is my conjecture, but it is certain that astronomy shaped their thinking.  The North Star, seen by a viewer standing on the tip of the serpent’s tail, appears directly above the center of the serpent’s open jaw at the opposite end of the mound.  No accident, that.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, the three curves of its tail are aligned with the points on the horizon at which the sun rises on the longest and shortest days of the year … and the days that fall exactly in the middle between those two days.  \r\n\r\nThus, the effigy is a tool for astronomical observation, night and day, a kind of calendar, marking the four most important milestone-days of the year:  June 21, September 21, December 21 and March 21.\r\n\r\nThe creature’s jaws are stretched wide as it swallows and/or emits an ovoid ring.  Is it an egg?  Does it represent the sun?  Did the Moundbuilders’ cosmology explain the alternation of day and night as the result of a giant snake alternately swallowing and emitting the ‘egg-sun’ in perpetual repetition? \r\n\r\nWhen, at the opening of the piece, you hear the four-note shape descending, imagine that the serpent is swallowing the egg.  Later, when the same shape is heard upside down, ascending (at ms. 26), imagine that the egg is being emitted.  \r\n\r\nBack and forth, up and down, in and out, night and day, a neverending process, expressed by the ancient Moundbuilders in the shape of their Serpent Mound.    \r\n\r\nTo see and hear my cellist friend Sherill Roberts playing “Serpent Mound” in the recent premier recording of the work, which she kindly made at my request, copy and paste this link into your browser:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/wah243LmpGI\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),173);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(133,replace(replace('Should the deacons buy flowers to decorate the tables for the church’s annual Shrove Tuesday pancake supper?\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said our pastor, Susan Quinn Bryan.  “Pretty is important!”\r\n\r\nEvery time I’ve visited France, I’ve said to myself:  “Here is a culture that doesn’t need to be reminded that ‘Pretty is important.’ \r\n\r\nNot that you need to be reminded either.  If you didn’t agree that “Pretty is important,” you wouldn’t like my music.  And if you didn’t like my music, you wouldn’t permit me to send you these Sunday morning emails.  Still, let me share two ‘petites aventures françaises’ that pressed upon me the truth of that aphorism.\r\n\r\nDriving along a two-lane highway somewhere in south-central France, we came upon a stretch of road where double columns of sycamore trees grew on either side.  They were gigantic, perhaps 200 years old, arching over the highway, a tunnel of green.  The double columns went on and on, for maybe six miles.  Beyond the trees, on both sides, were farm fields.  I don’t recall the crops; maybe yellow sunflowers, purple lavendar or grains, green and golden.\r\n\r\nI never imagined that the edges of a highway could be so beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf that road existed in America, in Ohio, it would be a tourist attraction.  People would come from all over to drive the famous six-mile stretch of road with a double lane of 200-year-old sycamore trees on either side.  \r\n\r\nAny variety of trees thus planted would be grand to see.  But sycamore trees -- ah! -- their beautiful camouflage-like bark of gray-beige and palest green, their broad Kelly-green leaves, the sunlight yellowing as it sifts through their abundant foliage.  A dendrophile’s dream.\r\n\r\nEven if you’re not a dendrophile, you know this tree.  Craving water, they spring up naturally at river’s edge and pond’s shore.  We sometimes plant them alongside our cities’ sidewalks and on boulevards. \r\n\r\nBut such a highway could not exist in America.  We embrace other values.   Owners of farm fields plant every available square foot, right up to the shoulder of the road.  No acreage would be wasted on worthless sycamore trees.\r\n\r\nAnd sycamore trees ARE worthless.  The wood is punky and wet.  It makes poor firewood.  Furniture is rarely made of sycamore, cherry and walnut being so much more beautiful.  \r\n\r\nIn France, the beauty of the living sycamore tree justifies its existence.  There, beauty often trumps greed.  Not always, but often and vividly.\r\n\r\nI doubt those trees along the highway are protected by zoning laws.  The culture protects them.  There is an unwritten agreement that, as the land is bought and sold over the years, the owners will not remove the trees so as to plant more crops.  The wider culture would deplore those who cut them down, so much so that cutting down the trees is virtually impossible.  But a new owner would never consider doing such a thing.  On the contrary, the trees along the highway would be understood as a treasured asset.\r\n\r\n“Pretty is important.”  France has known this for a very long time. \r\n\r\nA second example, s’il vous plait.  In the tiny village of Aubeterre-sur-Dronne, inhabited by perhaps 400 souls, there is a bakery on the square.  We were the only guests in the village’s only hotel.  I arose early and, my wife and children still asleep, I stole out, intending to return in my favorite role -- the father-hero -- re-entering the room in triumph, laden with pastries for breakfast.  \r\n\r\nWhen I reached the bakery, what I saw stopped me in my tracks.  (Not that I was leaving tracks -- the sidewalk was paved.)  In the bakery’s window was an amazing display.  \r\n\r\nThere were the baked goods, each singularly beautiful in itself -- colorful, glistening, a perfect golden brown -- and the baker had arranged the wares with great care, lining up the items in graceful, symmetrical curves, highlighting the contrasting colors and textures.  The window display was a work of art.  \r\n\r\nWhen we passed by the bakery again just after lunch, the window was empty.  Every item had been sold.\r\n\r\nThis in itself was amazing — few American villages of 400 would support a bakery.  \r\n\r\nThe effort to make a beautiful display was not required.  The village would have purchased the baked goods, regardless of the window display. \r\n\r\nYet, the next morning, probably before dawn, the owner would create another display, all over again, after having been baking since 1 am. \r\n\r\nWhy?  Why go to all that trouble?  The baker earned not a sou more by displaying the items so beautifully.  \r\n\r\nThe baker displayed the goods that way because that is what French people do. \r\n\r\nThat is a culture to emulate.  It has a deep commitment to the highest values, and to be, in short, France, to live up to its own expectation of itself, to be the radiant beacon of civilization, dazzling and inspiring the world.\r\n\r\nAs Charles De Gaulle put it so grandly, “France cannot be France without grandeur.”\r\n\r\nThat baker expressed, every day, the notion of the grandeur of France ... and for such a tiny audience!  A few friends, neighbors and the occasional tourist.\r\n\r\nAh! … la belle France!\r\n\r\nTo hear flutist Barb Sink performing my Pavane Américaine “Homage to Ravel” (and, by extension, to France) with her pianist brother Phil Amalong, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),59);

I anticipated that my music would be heard in recitals, concerts, worship services and broadcasts … and it was.\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, only because I thought it would be fun, I began sending a Sunday morning email to friends and fans.  From the start, I included a vignette, a ‘back story’ or a mini-essay, sometimes humorous, sometimes thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThen and now, I enjoyed doing the writing and enjoyed when friends responded.  Fun, indeed.  No big deal.\r\n\r\nThen, 14 months ago, came the pandemic.  Overnight, the purpose, meaning and impact of these emails deepened.  Deprived of concerts, recitals, worship services and each others’ company, our email inboxes assumed a new importance.\r\n\r\nThe practice of writing and sharing these emails has reshaped my notion of what I was doing when I was composing all that music and trying to get it “out there.”\r\n\r\nWithout knowing it, I was preparing to be in a position to send out these ‘e-pistles’ as gestures of friendship during the worst year in living memory.\r\n\r\nGetting to the point that I could do such a thing was a lengthy, expensive and complicated process.  Until 1995, all of my scores were hand-written.  I had to master a computer music notation program so that I could share professional-looking scores in PDF form; I hired a graduate student to tutor me.  I had to recruit musicians -- some played for fun, some for money.  I had to engage and pay engineers to record my music in rented studio space.  \r\n\r\nA good friend set up a domain for me, a website to serve as a platform (if that’s the word).  I had to build and maintain a data base of addresses of friends and fans who have said that they WANT to receive these emails.  I had to write the verbiage, i.e, a weekly ‘column’ to elucidate the music, an on-going task at which I joyfully tinker almost every day.  I conceive these emails about five or six weeks in advance and each one is revised at least thirty times before I send it out.  I’m not complaining!  Believe it or not, revising is engrossing and always feels FUN to me.\r\n\r\nI now see that the sending of these weekly emails in this time of crisis is largely WHY I was composing for all those years.  The goal was to offer a little “joy in the morning.”\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to Psalm 30:  “Weeping may tarry for the night but joy comes with the morning.”\r\n\r\nI set these words to music long ago, in 1975, as a deliberate gesture of reaction and rebellion against the avant garde style of writing that had been pressed upon me during my “School of Music” years.  It is very traditional, very conservative, with a straightfoward melody and a familiar chord progression.  I was affirming my intention that my music would NOT be  written in a bizarrely new, unique style never heard before, but rather as one small extension of an existing tradition.  \r\n\r\nTo hear Heidi Miller and Chris Miller (no relation) singing, with an accompaniment performed by Beth Troendly, my setting of that verse, click on the link above (be patient, please; the music begins at :09).\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),174);

Others are friends I’ve never met and probably never will.  It used to seem strange to claim folks as friends without having met them but social media has rendered it commonplace, expanding our definition of friendship.\r\n\r\nOne such is Peter Stoll of Toronto.  When I sent my “Variations on a Theme by Grandma Moses” to all the clarinetists on my database, Peter made a youtube of his performance of it, which I shared with you exactly a year ago.\r\n\r\nNow Peter has kindly done it again, this time recording my “Variations Plain & Simple,” written in January.\r\n\r\nI asked Peter to describe himself for you:\r\n\r\n	“I''m a sort of clarinet poly-glot: I play many sizes of clarinet, plus a few of saxophone, and in a range of styles.  I started out working mainly in contemporary classical music ensembles, but have branched back into doing a lot of orchestral concerts, chamber music and solo recitals too.  I played as a frequent occasional clarinetist in musicals here in Toronto, when we had a "Broadway boom" in the 90''s. I got known for covering many sizes of clarinet and saxophone, once covering 4 consecutive solos in a rehearsal of Ravel''s Bolero (the conductor never forgot that one!).\r\n\r\n	“I teach at the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto. I''ve gone from starting one clarinet student to teaching three performance and music education courses and coaching chamber music.  I have a large studio of clarinetists today.  So professionally I''ve been a survivor, moving from activity to activity. \r\n\r\n	“I find pleasure in the simplest yet most profound level of music-making and teaching:  the joy of creating beauty in sound.”\r\n\r\nThis latest set of variations resulted from the pandemic.  It’s meant to be of use to musicians who, ‘stuck at home,’ are exploring the solo repertoire.  The theme is original, tender and American-sounding, like a folk hymn or a love theme from a Western.\r\n\r\nThe light-hearted character of the piece is confirmed when “Entrance of the Gladiators,” Fučik’s famous circus march, briefly invades a chromatic variation about a third of the way through the piece.  \r\n\r\nLater, there’s an homage to the folk tune “Shenandoah” and a touch of reverence when a wisp of Bach’s “Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring” is heard in the coda.\r\n\r\nAfter Peter made this youtube, I expanded the cadenza that begins at ms. 205.  I mention this in case you notice the minor discrepancy between what you’ll hear in the youtube and what you’ll see written at that point in the score.\r\n\r\n(If you are a flutist or an oboist and would like to play this piece, let me know and I’ll send you an appropriately transposed version:  G major for flute, F major for oboe.  I also have a version for solo trumpet, cast in E flat major for.)\r\n\r\nThis video reminds non-musicians that music-making is physical.  Because music brings us to a certain ‘state of mind’ and because a ‘state of mind’ is intangible, we sometimes half-forget that, every time we hear music, it is because someone has exerted themselves and in a particular place.  Breath, muscles, posture and a disciplined intellect are required.  Acoustics, temperature, time of day, even humidity, influence a performance, to say nothing of the clarinet reed, a source of endless frustration and concern for clarinetists.  \r\n\r\nThe physical setting of the performance also contributes, as you will see when you view Peter, so relaxedly, playing this piece in the comfort of his lovely home.\r\n\r\nThank you, musicians, for all you do.
