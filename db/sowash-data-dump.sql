We half-delude ourselves; maybe this year will be different, maybe winter won''t come.  But November has finally set in, even here in  Ohio''s southernmost (and most Southern) city.\r\n\r\nMy Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and piano is subtitled "Shadows of November."  The subtitle sounds better in French: "Les Ombres de Novembre." That''s how it appears on the score''s cover page because I wrote it for a superb French clarinetist, my good friend Lucien Aubert, and the trio in which he played, who called themselves "les Gavottes."\r\n\r\nYou''re invited to listen to the final movement, 3.5 minutes long, as recorded by les Gavottes. Gosh, they''re good!  You''re going to love this, I predict.\r\n\r\nIt might not sound November-ish, so let me explain.  There are three movements in this work.  The first movement is ambiguous, like a November fog.  The second movement is deeply mournful, perhaps the saddest music I''ve written.  Then comes the third movement, the one I want to share with you this evening.\r\n\r\nTo me, this music expresses the bracing, exuberant, almost vulgar zest of November.  We hunker down, snuggle into a cozy chair, stretch our legs in front of the fire, drink red wine, tell funny stories and laugh with our friends even as, outside, the freezing rain is slicing through the evening air.  Half way through this movement the music becomes so spirited that it almost sounds like a high school band determinedly performing a half-time show in a heavy, pebble-y hail of sleet.  \r\n\r\nThis music is jovial yet biting, as if to say:  the great god Pan never dies, the energy of life is forever reaffirmed.  Which reminds me of a poem I wrote.\r\n\r\nI''ve written five books, but very little poetry.  A few years ago, however, circumstances forced me to devise some words for a November-ish tune of mine which I wanted to include in a choral work.  Choristers need words to sing, so I was forced to become, for once, a lyricist as well as a composer.  I set myself to the task, bore down, wouldn''t quit until I''d come up with something suitable.  \r\n\r\nI think the words I came up with express the same ideas about November that are expressed musically in this trio.  \r\n\r\nHere''s the poem, such as it is.\r\n\r\nLife''s Oldest Song\r\n\r\nGone now are the autumn leaves, \r\nto cold earth they have fled, \r\nand all of the trees seem dreary now \r\nthat once were yellow and red. \r\n\r\nOver us now cold winds are blowing, \r\nmourning the passing of fall, \r\nreminding us of the truth immutable: \r\ndeath comes to us all. \r\n\r\nSuch words we cannot gainsay. \r\nThis truth to all is known, \r\nand we feel it most keenly this time of year, \r\nwhen autumn colors have flown.  \r\n\r\nYet look again at field and forest, \r\nstudy the stubble and twig: \r\na hint of color foretells a blossom \r\nwill bloom forth from each sprig. \r\n\r\nSo friends, let us gather now \r\nand sing Life''s Oldest Song, \r\nreminding ourselves to love that well \r\nwhich we must leave ere long, \r\n\r\nConsoling one another''s sorrows, \r\nraising our voices high, \r\nliving life more fully though knowing \r\nthat, like leaves, we must fly.\r\n\r\nMy Trio #3, "Shadows of November," was recorded by Les Gavottes.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nNovember, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne of my oldest friends is Dick Ferrell, whom I have known for more than half a century.  Back in 1961, when I joined Boy Scout Troop 152 of Lexington, Ohio, I was assigned to the Red Fox Patrol.  Dick was my Patrol Leader.  Through our teens we were together on many, many Scouting adventures — hiking, camping in all weathers, competing in woodcraft skills, cooking over campfires.  We both became Eagle Scouts at the same Court of Honor in 1966.  Later, in our thirties, we served Scouting as adult volunteers, leading High Adventure canoe trips to Algonquin Provincial Park where we saw moose, bears, minks, loons and heard wolves howl at the moon, a sound I will always remember.\r\n\r\nNow we’re old guys.  It’s been a long time since either of us slept in a tent.  “The ground has gotten so much harder than it used to be,” says Dick.  “It must have something to do with global warming.”  \r\n\r\nTroop 152 is still going strong and has turned out nearly a hundred Eagle Scouts.  Dick still lives near Lexington and keeps me posted.\r\n\r\nSometimes he sends me poems he’s written.  Here’s one about the peculiar, stark beauty of this time of year, something Dick and I have observed, firsthand, together, on many a camping trip.\r\n\r\nNovember Has A Beauty All Its Own\r\n\r\nHe views the naked cornfield\r\nRinged with gray and brown and black,\r\nAnd he knows that fall has fallen\r\nAnd there is no turning back.\r\n\r\nThere''s a twinkling of twilight\r\nAs he hurries down the path\r\nTo the warm and candled window\r\nOf his rustic woodsy shack.\r\n\r\nHe smells decay and oldness\r\nMixed with pine and apple scent,\r\nAnd he sees the snow clouds gather\r\nRank on rank, in their ascent.\r\n\r\nHe feels the cold wind quicken,\r\nAnd he hears the forest moan\r\nAs he''s reminded: November has\r\nA beauty all its own.\r\n\r\nIn my Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Shadows of November,” I tried to express it musically.\r\n\r\nTo hear the French trio, “les Gavottes,” play the first movement from "Shadows of November,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 8, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOctober turned my maple’s leaves to gold.\r\nThe most are gone now; here and there, one lingers.\r\nSoon these will slip from the twigs’ weak hold\r\nLike coins between a dying miser’s fingers.   — Thomas Bailey Aldrich\r\n\r\nTo put it plainly, November is upon us.\r\n\r\nAfter evoking April in my second trio for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled “Enchantment of April,” I immediately began writing work trio for that same, wonderful combination of instruments.  Turning for inspiration to the opposite end of the calendar, I entitled my third trio:  “Shadows of November.”\r\n\r\nThe title sounds better in French:  “Les Ombres de Novembre.”  Don’t roll your eyes!  I am not trying to be fancy-schmancy.  I wrote all thirteen of my clarinet-cello-piano trios for “les Gavottes,” three superb French musicians who make their home on the Riviera and they premiered and recorded several of them.\r\n\r\nThe first and last movements of my November trio are strong and defiant, rippling with dark energy, gainsaying the broodings on death and defeat that the penultimate month can prompt.  \r\n\r\nThe first movement is robust; hearing it now, I remember what it felt like to split logs with a wedge and a sledge on a damp November day, back in the 1980’s when we lived on a half-acre enclosed by woods, at the edge of Gambier, Ohio.  I felt fully awake and alive; my breath was visible, I was conscious of the muscles in my chest and arms, the slow onset of blisters on my hands, the sweat beneath my red woolen stocking cap.  “Who splits his own firewood warms himself twice.”\r\n\r\nThe last movement is robuster yet, striving to channel the deathless energy of Nature herself, hibernating just now, certain to reassert itself come Spring.\r\n\r\nThe middle movement, the music I want to share with you today, squarely faces the inescapable facts of November:  summer is gone, glorious autumn is in full retreat.  Now comes a long string of cold, grim, raw, short, dark days.\r\n\r\nConnecticut writer Odell Shepard gave a voice to November''s intimations; it does me good to ‘hear’ his honest words, so strong, so simple:\r\n\r\n	“The frost walked last night.  From the maple tree that shades my roof, the golden and scarlet  leaves are sidling down through the sunny morning air, leaving at every moment a little more blue.  No cricket sings.  There has been havoc in the multitude of ferns.  Summer is gone and I must soon be going.”  \r\n\r\nHearing this music may do you some good, too.  I hope so.\r\n\r\nTo hear the French trio “les Gavottes” performing the second movement from Trio #3 for clarinet, cello and pian, "Shadows of November,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 6, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),55);

You may not think of it this way, but you are gifting me by allowing me to share these musical messages with you.  When artists know their work is engaging an audience, even a small one, It means so much that it feels like a gift. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis time I want to share a short original Christmas carol (2:48; the fourth link on the list above).\r\n\r\nNon-Christian friends and fans, please pardon the Christmas reference.  It''s not my intention to proselytize.  What I want to share is the sweetness of the tune, for its own sake, the Christian content aside.\r\n\r\nThe carol is sung by Jose Rubio, a wonderful baritone who used to live in the apartment right above ours, here on Milton Street in Cincinnati.  It was a joy to hear him vocalizing upstairs!  \r\n\r\nIn this recording, Jose sings the carol with such warmth and feeling that I fancy I can hear him smiling as he sings.  And I love the way rolls his ''r''s.\r\n\r\nAs befits a carol, the tune is simple and doesn''t vary through the four verses.  Instead, it’s the accompaniment that differs for each verse:  the piano is tone-painting the ideas expressed in the lyrics.  \r\n\r\nTo see how this is done, follow the words as you listen:\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morn the birds all wake and fly, cu-roo, \r\nto seek the Child with wand''ring cry, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nthe thrush, the swallow, the bluebird small, \r\nthey gather round His cradle stall, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo. \r\n\r\nThe crow and jay their raucous cries do still, cu-roo, \r\nto join the dove and whippoorwill, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nthe larks in exultation sing \r\nto glorify their newborn King, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo.     	       \r\n\r\nOn silent wings the wise-eye''d owls descend, cu-roo, \r\nthe falcon and the sweet brown wren, cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nwith quail and pheasant by Mary''s side \r\nthe folk of field and glen abide, cu-roo, cu-roo, cu-roo. \r\n\r\nThe feather''d choir its cheerful an-thems raise, cu-roo, \r\nto warm the frosty dawn with praise cu-roo, cu-roo, \r\nand with the angel host above, \r\nthey greet the tiny Bird of Love, cu-roo, cu-roo.\r\n\r\nThe tune for this carol came to me in a dream in the Fall of 1978.  This has happened only three or four times.  I woke up and wrote it down, quickly!  I was afraid I''d forget it.  I always thought the tune sounded like a Christmas carol; later I added appropriate words.\r\n\r\nIn scoring the tune, I had the idea of including, in the piano part, quotations of one of the world’s most famous melodies.  Several times and especially at the end, you''ll hear the piano accompaniment quoting the opening of J.S. Bach''s most famous tune, "Jesu, Joy of Man''s Desiring." \r\n\r\nBach’s “Jesu” tune is one of the greatest melodies ever conceived, ever-fresh, always a blessing.  What gifts old Bach left for us!  \r\n\r\nJose Rubio is joined by Avedis Manoogian in the recording above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThe Golden Lamb is Ohio’s oldest inn, in operation since 1803.  My grandparents dearly loved the place and sometimes took my brother and me there for weekend stays back in the 1950’s.  I remember sleeping in the huge, carved, Victorian bed in the room that honors Charles Dickens, one of the inn’s many famous guests.\r\n\r\nUnchanged today, the Golden Lamb is a place where I can still feel the presence of my beloved grandparents.  Our own little family dines there, once a year, on Jo’s birthday.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1970’s we stayed in the inn with a group of friends we’d brought down from north central Ohio (where we lived until 1994) to attend the Boar’s Head Festival at Cincinnati’s Christ Church Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne of our party, impressed with the inn’s Christmas decorations, said, “There ought to be a Carol of the Golden Lamb.”   A few weeks later she sent me a sweet little poem she’d written.  Here it is:\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Carol of the Golden Lamb \r\n	 by K. A. (she likes to keep a low profile, unlike a certain hambone composer you know)\r\n\r\nThe frost lay light upon the slopes, \r\nThe stars were crystal thorns, \r\nWhen from the soul of earth''s weak hopes \r\nThe Shepherd Child was born.\r\n\r\nThen came all creatures great and small \r\nTo celebrate the new-born King; \r\nWith muzzled fang and sheathed claw \r\nTheir homage wild to bring. \r\n\r\nBut one small lamb, the only one \r\nOf winged and creeping folk, \r\nNew-born as well, had missed the Son \r\nWhom men of old forespoke. \r\n\r\nWell-guarded by her shepherd''s crook \r\nThe lamb grew ever strong. \r\nYet longing sunny days o''er-took \r\nAnd hushed the lambkin''s song. \r\n\r\nOne hazy dawn she slipped away \r\nTo roam the dusty streets. \r\nShe found the tiny Prince that day \r\nAnd kept her vigil sweet. \r\n\r\nShe watched Him from the open door; \r\nShe dared not enter there\r\nFor fear her hooves upon the floor \r\nWould wake the Infant fair. \r\n\r\nThe Babe awoke and crowed with glee \r\nTo see the curly lamb. \r\nHe crooned in child-like hymnody, \r\nHe waved His tiny hands. \r\n\r\nAnd as she knelt beside His cot, \r\nThe golden Day-spring sun\r\nGlowed soft and shining on her coat — \r\nOf golden ringlets spun. \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nI set this poem to music, first as a choral piece, later as a baritone solo.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Jose Rubio smilingly singing "Carol of The Golden Lamb” (I fancy I can hear his smile, especially in the final line when he rolls the “R” in “ringlets") with collaborative pianist Avedis Manoogian, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 27, 2015\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),67);

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(5,replace(replace('Did you ever listen to a painting?  I have.  For hours at a time.  \r\n\r\nFor eight and a half years, I worked two or three days a week as a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, keeping watch over fabulous treasures displayed in large, echoing galleries.  When there were no visitors, I sometimes amused myself by trying to imagine what a painting would sound like if its subject matter were to be conveyed musically.\r\n\r\nThat little mental puzzle resulted in my two three-movement "Impressionist Suites" for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, each movement conveying the imagery and brushwork of a major French Impressionist painter.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Art Museum has only one painting by Monet, but it''s a doozie.  He renders the sombre cliffs of his native Normandy in tones of deep, dark rust and sets them in a tossing, vibrant ocean of sapphire, indigo, emerald and mint, dashed with strokes of salmon, magenta and lavender, arched by clouds like sherbet in a pink-orange sky.\r\n\r\nHow can a composer catch that in music?\r\n\r\nBy consulting his memory.  Our understanding of music is shaped by our memories of all the music we have heard.  When I ran a search through my memory for nautical-sounding music, my recollections were awash with half-remembered sea chanteys, fragments from "HMS Pinafore," "La Mer" and the stirring scores of many a swashbuckling pirate movie.   \r\n\r\nI thought of the ''colors'' of those three piquant instruments:  oboe, clarinet and bassoon.  I put those three instruments to work, playing a canon.  You''ll hear it right off in the low bassoon, then an octave higher in the clarinet, then yet another octave higher in the oboe ... and we''re away! like a ship with sails bellying into the wind! I Into the tossing, dazzling, salt-tanged seascape Monet evoked so memorably.\r\n\r\nI wrote my two Impressionist Suites in 2000 for my friend Lucien Aubert, clarinetist in Le trio d’anches Ozi.

This Monet movement will please you, too, hopefully. It''s played -- beautifully! -- by Mark Ostoich, Ron Aufmann and Mark Ortwein.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nJanuary 12, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWill you kindly permit me a longer-than-usual message?  \r\n\r\nHave I told you that I’m teaching French?\r\n\r\nIn the 2012-2013 school year I visited, twice, a remarkable K-12 Cincinnati school called “Leaves of Learning," a resource center where home-schooled students come for enrichment — for one or two classes or more, one, two, three or four days a week.  I was very impressed with the joyful, easy, accepting tone of the school and the students’ genuine enthusiasm for learning.  \r\n\r\nYou may know that, in addition to being a composer, I also write and publish books for young people about Ohio history, animals and folklore.  As a result, over the past thirty years, I’ve spent a day or two in more than 2,000 Ohio schools as a Visiting Author.  I became very accustomed to working with young people and have long felt very much at ease in visiting schools, albeit only as a ''One Day Wonder.’   \r\n\r\nToo, in my twenties and thirties, I had been a Scoutmaster.   I’ve always felt happy and at ease with young people.  I like them and they like me.  I had plenty of experience showing kids how to do things — in Scouts and in the schools I’d visited — but I was never a regular teacher, never committed myself to regularly recurring instruction sessions with a particular band of young souls.\r\n\r\nAfter my second day visiting Leaves of Learning, my host, a fine teacher named Terri Burch, said, “You should be teaching here!”  \r\n\r\nI baulked, scoffed.  “I’m not certified.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to be certified to teach here.  Talk to the principal, offer a course or two and if there are enough enrollees, you’ll teach.”\r\n\r\nWell, we set it up for me to start in September of 2014.  I would teach only on Wednesdays.  Two classes:  Music Theory and The Art of Storytelling.  I figured I’d give it a try, one day a week, for one school year.\r\n\r\nI told the principal that I would also be willing to substitute for the teachers of some other subjects as well … Language Arts, History, French.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the French teacher was unwell and I was soon ‘subbing’ for her quite often.  It was a little daunting at first.  My French is strong but it was rusty.  In college, I studied French intensively and did well.  But that was 45 years earlier.  I’ve visited France many times since, often staying in the homes of friends who spoke only French.  I''ve benefited greatly from their patient, humorous corrections of my gusty, improvised, somewhat surreal French.  But could I teach French?  Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you know how best to teach it!\r\n\r\nStill, as a sub, I only needed to stay a little ahead of the students in order to lead the class.\r\n\r\nI found that I loved subbing in French, imparting the mnemonic devices that have worked for me, challenging the students to create new ones, sharing stories of my adventures and blunders as an American joyfully floundering about in French. Plus stories of French history, culture and cuisine, garnered from my reading and experiences.  I am ardent about France, the land of my father’s ancestors.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the French teacher became increasingly unwell and in January of 2015 her bad health finally forced her to retire.  The principal invited me to take over the French program.  I gulped, but accepted the challenge.  Being halfway through a school year would present a particular challenge but I figured I’d survive until May and then we’d see.\r\n\r\nTeaching French the way I thought I could best teach it, free from the constraints of the lesson plans that are necessarily imposed on a substitute teacher, turned out to be a slice of Heaven.  I’ve loved every minute of it.   The school encourages creativity in both faculty and students and we make the most of it!  The students are great souls and we love to joke and ponder together as we explore the intricacies and delicacies of this beautiful, expressive, eccentric language.\r\n\r\nIn my Scout troop we had a saying:  “If it isn''t fun, it isn''t Scouting.”  If something we were doing wasn’t fun, we knew we were doing it wrong.  I apply that same approach in my classes with the happy result that we laugh together, frequently, often loudly.  \r\n\r\nWhen the school year ended and summer began, I found that I missed teaching very much.  I signed on for another year and my enthusiasm for teaching French (and Music Theory and Storytelling, which I have continued to teach) is unabated.\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect to continue teaching at Leaves of Learning for several years, into my seventies.  I tell the students, “I’m the school''s Oldest Living Teacher.”  They laugh.  \r\n\r\n“I’m the Gandalf of this school,” I tell them, “and you guys are the Hobbits!”  They laugh, but in a way, it’s true.  I’ve got the white beard.  I''m jolly but a little mysterious.  I’m very interested in them.  I’ve been “out there,” doing various things in the wide world for a long time -- France, most often -- while they''ve been growing up in the Shire.  \r\n\r\nMost of my trips to France have resulted from my music, one way or another.  I’ve been there for rehearsals, performances, recordings.  I’ve written many works for my French musician friends.  \r\n\r\nMy two “Impressionist Suites” for reed trio, for example.  Each movement attempts to evoke the spirit and character of a major French Impressionist painter.\r\n\r\nToday I’d like to share with you the final movement of the first of the suites.  It’s entitled, “Manet:  Spanish subjects.”  \r\n\r\nFrench people are fascinated by Spain; so far as I can tell, the French seem to consider the Spanish to be more spontaneous than themselves, in closer touch with the earth, with basic passions.  To the French, Spaniards seem to be more alive, more authentic, their approach to Life seeming more vivid, colorful and spicy than than theirs. Just think about “Carmen” or the Spanish subjects in the paintings of Manet.  By contrast, the French seem to view themselves as overly cultivated, too cerebral, too self-conscious, more than a little jaded.\r\n\r\nOf course, to an American like me, an outsider, these attitudes seem almost laughable, laden with stereotypes.  But delicious to discover.\r\n\r\nI hope my delight comes across in this music.  Note that it ends with all three musicians shouting, “Ole!"\r\n\r\nTo hear it played -- beautifully! -- by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 13, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),36);

It was her idea to arpeggiate many of the chords and to vary the customary twang of the instrument by using the more delicate lute stop now and again.\r\n\r\nWhen I hear this music, I picture a shy creature, smaller, more graceful than a deer, with grave, dark eyes, gamboling in the moonlight.

And this coming December will mark the 50th anniversary of our first date.  I can hardly grasp that Jo and I have passed that many years in the close company of one another.\r\n\r\nI like what Will Durant said:  "The love we have in our youth is superficial compared to the love that an old man has for his old wife.”\r\n\r\nI know that is true but, honestly, I don’t think of myself as an old man and I don’t think of Jo as an old wife.  Heck, I’m only 67!  And she’s 66!  (Yes, I married ''a younger woman.’)\r\n\r\nStill, superficially or otherwise, a half century in love with the same lady is, well, a long time.  It’s not exactly an achievement.  It wasn’t some steep task that we were determined to accomplish against all odds.  We just kept on keeping on, day by day, sharing a great many laughs and not a few ongoing negotiations while half a century slipped by.\r\n\r\nI once told an older, long-married friend, “When it comes to women, I’ve never been adventurous, never ventured out beyond the shallow water close to shore.

We need something to make us smile. \r\n\r\nLet''s make off to sunny ancient Greece and spend a little time with that lovable cuss, Diogenes!\r\n\r\nI offer you The Philosopher, the first movement of a three-movement choral work entitled: Philosophical Anecdotes.\r\n\r\nI wrote this piece in 1979 for the Kenyon College Choir.  I thought about the students who would sing it.  They study philosophy and classics; surely they''d like to sing something sublime, ancient, Greek.  But Kenyon students also have a sense of the irony of their situation, pursuing the liberal arts in Gambier, Ohio, surrounded by cornfields.\r\n\r\nI remembered Diogenes, the great curmudgeon.  An ancient Greek philosopher, yes, but a wag, a grump, a mocker of mundane values.  I thought that irreverent settings of anecdotes about a guy like Diogenes might appeal to the students.  It did!  They sang the music with gusto!\r\n\r\nThree of Diogenes'' exploits are recounted in the piece.  The first movement, The Philosopher, sets to music a prose account of the old grump’s most celebrated moment, when he snubs Alexander the Great.  The opening words of the story have a distinctive calypso rhythm.  Recite them yourself:  "The philosopher Diogenes lived in a tub!"  Snap your fingers as you half-speak/half-sing those words.  Accent the important syllables and, bingo, you''ve got the opening of my setting, and thus the mood for the whole piece, an improbable combination of ancient Athens and calypso music!\r\n\r\nI love to write rounds.  Choirs learn them quickly and easily.  Singing a round, a choir can sound terrific after only a few minutes of rehearsal.  My setting of those words about Diogenes just happened to make a couple of mighty fine rounds!  You''ll hear them sung first in unison, then in parts.\r\n\r\nThe second movement recounts Diogenes'' famous search, with a lantern, in broad daylight, for an honest man, the third his contemptuous quip upon visiting a country fair, "Lord, how many things there are in the world of which Diogenes hath no need!"  Those movements are funny, too, but let''s hear them for some other time.\r\n\r\nFor now, you''re cordially invited to pass three minutes in the company of Diogenes.  Don''t expect much from him!  Alexander the Great would have done anything for Diogenes, but the philosopher''s only request of the most powerful man in the world was that he get out of his light. \r\n\r\nHa!  You have to love the old rascal!\r\n\r\nPhilosophical Anecdotes is performed here by The Gregg Smith Singers.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nJanuary 26, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nWeary of dreary February?

A wag, a scold, a mocker of mundane values.  I thought that settings of anecdotes about the irreverent Mr. Diogenes might appeal to the Kenyon students.  I was right!  They sang it lustily!\r\n\r\nThree of Diogenes'' exploits are recounted in the piece.  The first movement sets to music an account of the old grump’s celebrated snub of Alexander the Great, no less.  The last movement recounts Diogenes’ visit to a country fair where he snorts at all the frivolous “finnimbruns” offered for sale.\r\n\r\nIn the second movement, Diogenes does ‘street theatre,’ carrying a lit lantern through Athens, mid-day, begging the question, “What are you doing, Diogenes?”  He has his answer ready:  “Looking for an honest man."\r\n\r\nHa!  You have to love the old rascal!\r\n\r\nIf you want to follow the lyrics as you listen to my setting, here they are:\r\n\r\n“Diogenes’ Lanthorne” by Samuel Rowlands, 1628\r\n\r\n"Athens I seek for honest men,\r\nBut I shall find them God knows when.\r\nI’ll search the city, where I can see\r\nOne honest man, he shall go home with me."\r\n\r\nAn odd day’s work Diogenes once made\r\nAnd ’twas to seek an honest man, he sayed.\r\nThrough Athens with a lantern he did go\r\nWhen people saw no cause he should do so\r\nFor it was mid-day and the sun did shine,\r\nYet he unto a humor did incline.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Athens I seek … etc."\r\n\r\nHe spake as free to Alexander’s face\r\nAs if the meanest plowman were in his place.\r\n’Twas no men’s persons that he did respect,\r\nNo matter where he looked, vice he did detect.\r\n\r\nImagine you see him walking your streets\r\nAnd everyone’s a knave with whom he meets.\r\nNote their descriptions, which good censure craves,\r\nThen judge if he rightly might count them all knaves.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Athens I seek … etc."   \r\n\r\nTo hear the Gregg Smith Singers performing The Search from Philosophical Anecdotes, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 26, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),94);

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(11,replace(replace('Today I''m thinking about heroes, what makes a hero, and how to express heroism musically.\r\n\r\nI''ve known some heroes.  My father, Colonel Richard Sowash, US Army Reserves, was a decorated hero of WWII.  My Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," written in 2000, is dedicated to his memory.  \r\n\r\nMy Scoutmaster, Frank Culp, was a hero to me and to many other young men who came through Troop 152 in Lexington, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nMy grandfather, John Hoff, whose influence was the most important in my life, about whom I wrote lovingly in my otherwise comical autobiography, The Boy Who Would Be Famous, entertained and inspired me, as a boy, with splendid stories of heroes from American history.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago I wrote a book for older elementary school children entitled, "Heroes of Ohio:  23 True Tales of Courage and Character," dedicated to that same grandfather.   For that book, my definition of a hero was:  someone who volunteers to do something challenging to help other people.  Simple!\r\n\r\nExpressing heroism musically is not so simple.  \r\n\r\nComposers have expressed heroism:  Beethoven''s Eroica Symphony, Wagner''s Gotterdammerung, Strauss'' Ein Heldenleben.\r\n\r\nBut they lived long ago and far away and their heroic music, great as it may be, feels remote, perhaps too lofty, as an expression of heroism in the "here and now" of our own time.\r\n\r\nToo, those are orchestral works.  When I set out to express heroism, I was writing for just three instruments:  violin, cello and piano.  Quite a different thing!  No brass, no timpani, no string and wind sections sawing and tooting, triple forte.\r\n\r\nMost of the heroic music that genuinely moves me reached my ears via film scores for great Hollywood westerns like The Magnificent Seven, How The West Was Won, The Big Country. Also the TV westerns I grew up watching:  Wagon Train, Bonanza.  To me, that is what the music of heroism sounds like.\r\n\r\nYet not exactly, not entirely.  After all, I am not a composer writing scores for Hollywood westerns.  My peculiar career has been as far removed from Hollywood as it has been from Academe or the New York avant garde.  My challenge was to find a way to incorporate the galloping excitement, the expansive textures and the sense of adventure found in the best western film scores into a work of serious, contemporary chamber music.\r\n\r\nThe result is this Presto, the final movement from my Piano Trio #5, "Eroica," in which a feeling of heroism is intended to prevail over the darker, troubled music of the earlier movements.\r\n\r\nDoes this final movement sound "too Hollywood?"  I don''t think so.  You''d never hear music like this in a western film score.  Does it genuinely express heroism, in a way that transcends the Hollywood influences?  See what you think.\r\n\r\nThe Presto from my Eroica trio is beautifully performed by violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nFeb. 23, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThe terrifying events of September 11, 2001, brought sudden death to innocent people, called forth great heroism and sacrifice in the community of public servants who stand ready to try to rescue the imperiled, consigned many more to deep mourning in the months and years that followed, stirred dark urges for vengeance, precipitated our mad plunge into war with Iraq which in turn brought ceaseless chaos to the Middle East, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and displacing millions more.\r\n\r\nThe president chose Cincinnati’s Museum Center as the venue to announce that America was going to war with Iraq.  With a couple hundred other Cincinnatians, I stood in the street outside, a pathetic figure, an obscure composer holding a home-made cardboard sign, protesting.  We knew it was futile.  Polls at the time indicated that fully 90% of Americans were strongly in favor of invading Iraq.  Now almost all Americans say it was a mistake.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anything could have stopped it.  What if John Paul II, the popular but enfeebled pope, would have come to Washington D.C., knelt on the steps of our Capital building?  What if, with the press crowding round, he had loudly prayed, begging God to sway America from this bad idea?  Come to think of it, why didn’t he do that?  I’m not Catholic but it seems like the sort of thing the pope and other major religious leaders ought to do.  Where were they?  I wonder if the current pope would do such a thing. \r\n\r\nWhen you screw up, you find out who your friends are:  they''re the ones who tell you that you are screwing up.  \r\n\r\nFrance, our oldest ally, the only major world power against whom America has never gone to war, without whose support our own Revolution would have failed, sternly warned us against invading Iraq.  Americans bitterly decried France for speaking up.  Many demanded to know if the Frenchies had forgotten D-Day and how, at great cost to ourselves, we had liberated them from the Nazis.\r\n\r\nCincinnatians and Americans everywhere ceased patronizing French restaurants.  The makers of French’s mustard ran TV ads, assuring viewers that French''s mustard wasn’t actually French; it was "just a family name."  In a bold gesture, our sagacious Congress forbade the serving of “French fries” in the Congressional cafeteria; the popular potato product was instead to be termed, “Freedom fries.”  That showed ‘em!   Absurd! \r\n\r\n“Nine Eleven” was fifteen years ago today but the miseries it precipitated continue to be suffered by ever greater numbers of people and in ever widening geographical circles.  Almost every day brings staggering news of terrorist attacks and heartbreaking stories of refugees, news that is nearly unbearable to hear and see.  Our war in Afghanistan is the longest in our history.  The Syrian Civil War has no end in sight.  Other countries in the region are on the brink of war.  Who knows when and how it will end?\r\n\r\nOur pastor knew how it could end.  The Sunday after the 9/11 attack, he said, “Terrorist attacks against America will cease only when we have befriended our enemies.”  It sounds like something a pastor would say.  Or Jesus.  Or Gandhi.  \r\n\r\nYou hear that, you nod your head in agreement, it makes sense ... and then it hits you:  “How can we ever befriend such crazy people?”  How indeed.  That’s the question that the best among us must continue to ponder.  I don’t know the answer but I am certain that it’s the right question to ask.  \r\n\r\nIt begs another question.  Are we currently doing anything to befriend our enemies?  It appears to me that our actions, since 9/11, have only served to make our enemies hate us all the more.  Sigh.\r\n\r\nAll this darkness reposed, unguessable, in the not-so-distant future when, in 2000, I wrote my fifth piano trio and subtitled it “Eroica.”  My fiftieth birthday arrived shortly after the millennium.  With those two major milestones in mind — 50 and 2000 -- I felt prompted to try to do something lofty and grand, to write as “great” a piece of music as I could.  Something Beethovenian, if possible.  \r\n\r\nI chose to try to express heroism.  “Eroica” is the Latin word for “heroic” and I subtitled the trio with this word, deliberately echoing Beethoven’s choice of that moniker for his great Third Symphony.\r\n\r\nWhen I was writing my Eroica trio I could not have foreseen that it would turn out to be a piece I’d want to share on what would become a tragic anniversary, September 11.\r\n\r\nWell, here we are, September 11, 2016 and I find myself asking you to listen to a piece of music, though I know that mere listening is a scant and shallow consolation.  \r\n\r\nConfronted with such Evil, what good comes of hearing music?  Yet how can we acknowledge or express what we feel about this dark anniversary?  How shall we shape our lives in response to it, today and in the days to come? \r\n\r\nAs most of us are not artists, we turn to the arts, in the hope of finding expressions on our behalf.  We know what we feel but we cannot find the words, the paint or the tunes; we cannot say it for ourselves.  \r\n\r\nWe can remember that we are not the first to confront a foundering, floundering world. We can ponder anew the wise counsel of those who have faced such a prospect before us.  Their words may console us more effectively than paintings or pieces of music.\r\n\r\nIn 1935 when the world''s economy had collapsed and fascism was on the rise, Odell Shepard, an America author whose writing I admire very much, wrote these words in his forgotten little book, The Cabin Down the Glen… \r\n\r\n	"At such a time in the world’s affairs, what can a man do to help -- a man who feels, as I feel it, his incalculable debt and obligation to mankind?  Shall he add his voice to the shouters?  Shall he too rush here and there?  Shall he get himself elected, or wealthy, or famous, so that he may increase his “influence?”  Or might he do perhaps as well if he should strive not so much to do as to be something?  … Better and more persuasive than anything he could say would be the example of a life lived quietly with the First Things, a life resting down upon the things found true, a life delving under and soaring over the wreck of the present to the things that everlastingly endure.”\r\n\r\nOn this September 11, I hope you find these words as comforting and inspiring as I do.  \r\n\r\nWhile Shepard’s words are still ringing in your consciousness, I invite you to listen to the opening movement of my Eroica trio, performed with passion and grace by my friends violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong.

"It’s entitled Eroica which is the Latin word for ‘heroic.''  Beethoven copped it for his Symphony #3 and I pulled the same stunt for my Piano Trio #5, which is the title work on that CD.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he said, putting down the CD and beating a hasty retreat before I could discern whether he was disappointed or relieved.\r\n\r\nYes, I have done time as a street vendor, hustling my product line to whomever sauntered by.\r\n\r\nFor several years, aspiring to be a fully engaged participant in this greatest of capitalist democracies, I strategically positioned myself, every Saturday morning, at Cincinnati’s historic Findlay Market.  I manfully took my place, cheek by jowl, with aproned butchers, cheese-mongers, fish-vendors and any number of other merchants, purveyors of vegetables, honeys, hand-made candles, soaps and myriad other finnimbruns.   \r\n\r\nI set up a card table and arranged my CDs in an appealing display, offering them for the inspection of all and sundry, smoothing the path for the possibility of a purchase by the likes of John Q. Public, Jane Doe, and Joe Sixpack.  \r\n\r\nI would embrace Free Enterprise!  Disdainer of arts council grants and/or the shelter of an academic niche, I felt I needs must stand toe-to-toe with my public; I would clasp ‘the invisible hand of the marketplace;’ I would swap the fruits of my artistic endeavors for filthy lucre!\r\n\r\nIt was fun.  Friends, spotting my stand at the market, asked me what I was up to.  “Hawking my wares!” was my riposte.  “Like the Pie-man whom Simple Simon met, going to the Fair.”  \r\n\r\nI chaffed with strangers, too, humanoids as new to me as I was to them, enchanting one and all with my bright smile and merry sallies.  I tickled such fancies as were within earshot by rendering well-known ditties on my recorder.  I brought along the wooden blocks my father made for me when I was a lad and built little castles and towers to attract the attention of passersby.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while I even sold a CD, though not to the gentleman who had misread the title of the CD, Eroica.  \r\n\r\nAfter a while, I thought I’d branch out.\r\n\r\nOne Monday morning, I set up my card table on the sidewalk in front of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, figuring music students might be curious to discover the work of a classical composer with the verve and chutzpah to offer his best efforts in the above-described manner.  Fully 75 minutes passed before a uniformed officer in the employ of Campus Security, safeguarding the purity of our academic institutions from the besmirching effects of commerce, ran me off.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, I thought, what if I had resisted?  What if I had drawn myself up, looked the officer in the eye and refused to leave?  What would he have done?  Called for back up.  Then what?  What if the students had used their cell phones to film what would happen next, to wit, the police overturning my table, frisking me, handcuffing me and pushing me into the paddy wagon? \r\n\r\nHeck, a youtube like that might have ‘gone viral.’  I might have become famous overnight.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it would have generated an unusual news story.  “Local classical composer arrested for attempting to sell CDs of his music in front of the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music.  Details at Eleven.”  \r\n\r\nYou can’t buy that kind of publicity!  \r\n\r\nI would probably have had to pay a fine and spend a restless night in The Slammer.  It might have been worth every penny.  It might have been worth a night of tossing and turning on a hard cot in a noisy cell block, trying to "knit up the raveled sleave of care."\r\n\r\nI’ll never know because, in fact, I did not seize the opportunity.  It shames me to admit it, but without so much as a murmur, I complied with the officer’s request.  I put my card table and CDs in the trunk of my car and drove home.\r\n\r\nFor several years thereafter, I contented myself with vending at Findlay Market, ceasing  only when I became an art guard, a gig which required me to be present and accounted for at the Cincinnati Art Museum on Saturday mornings.\r\n\r\nMy point is that peddling one''s artistry is bewildering.  Remember the Native American described by Thoreau in Walden?  He was astonished to discover that it was not enough merely to weave beautiful baskets; now he must also entice people to buy them!\r\n\r\nI hear you saying, "So what, Sowash?  What else is new?” \r\n\r\nQuite right, too.  I don’t know what your life is like, but pretty much everything about mine is confusing.  Not least of all, words.  \r\n\r\nAfter all, the word “eroica" is just one “t" short of “erotica.”  So near and yet so far!\r\n\r\nWhen I see “art heist,” I always think, “atheist.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I see “miniseries,” I always think, “miseries.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I see “facsimile,” I always think, “sick family.”  \r\n\r\nMusic, on the other hand, never confuses me.  Not like Life.  Music is what it is.  As with  everything in the natural world, music means only itself, nothing more, nothing less.  That’s one reason we love it.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Adagio movement of my Piano Trio #5, subtitled “Eroica,” performed superbly well by my friends violinist Laura Bossert, cellist Terry King and pianist Phil Amalong, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 23, 2017\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),37);

It''s a blast and I wish you and all my other friends and fans could be there.\r\n\r\nOne of the tunes the band will play, along with traditional New Orleans standards, will be a tune of mine, entitled "Beignets and Gelato."

I wrote a half-hour piece called North Country Suite which they premiered in April of 2012.  \r\n\r\nSince the Mississippi originates in northern Minnesota I decided to portray that great, vast, storied river in the suite''s third movement, entitled "Father of Waters" -- that''s what the word "Mississippi" once meant in a Native American language. \r\n\r\nThe movement begins almost inaudibly;  you won''t hear much in the first few seconds.\r\n\r\nThen come tentative, trickling fragments of tunes, an evocation of the bubbling of springs and the coalescing of little streams and creeks, already with a few jazzy "Blue" notes.  These come together in a broad, rolling theme with a distinctively American, Western feel and then, just when the movement seems to end (about three and a half minutes through), comes a surprise:  the music goes Dixieland! ... because, of course, the Mississippi culminates in "N''awlins!"  \r\n\r\nThe Dixieland music is familiar-sounding because I deliberately wrote it in a very familiar style -- but the tune is original, I assure you -- that''s my tune, "Beignets and Gelato."\r\n\r\nI even included a banjo part, hoping the orchestra could locate a banjo player.   Sure enough, at the premiere, the concert mistress'' banjo-playing father was featured, his first performance before a crowd, and looking very trim and handsome, in his tuxedo!\r\n\r\nJosh Aerie conducts the Heartland Symphony Orchestra''s  in the live, premiere performance of the "Father of Waters" movement from my North Country Suite.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH \r\nMarch 2, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAmerican place-names!  Now there’s a subject.  A careful examination of the map of Ohio — my life-long stomping ground — reveals crossroads, hamlets and villages with peculiar names.  Glandorf, Peebles, Burgoon, Overpeck, Deunquat, Pancoastburg, Tipp City, Mingo Junction, Mogadore, Fitchville, Chuckery.\r\n\r\nSome cue laughter:  Coolville, Reminderville, Outville, Celeryville, Getaway, Nellie, Big Bottom, Round Bottom, Fly, Flushing and -- best of all! -- Knockemstiff.  \r\n\r\nKnowing that such names are spread across the Buckeye State, the thoughtful Ohioan daresn''t disdain the perplexing place-names found in other states.  We must keep a straight face when our consciousness is penetrated by the likes of Gnawbone, IN, Wahoo, NE, Dimebox, TX, Rabbit Hash, KY or Podunk, CT.\r\n\r\nSome are downright oxymoronic.  Remembering Brilliant, OH, we Buckeyes must needs soft-pedal our natural astonishment when we come upon Liberal, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThere are stories behind these monikers.  In 1872, a good-hearted fellow by the name of S. S. Rogers built the first house in what would become Liberal, KS.  Rogers became famous in the region for dispensing water to weary travelers.  The commodity was precious but the generous Mr. Rogers liberally ladled the stuff of life to the longing lips of thirsty pioneers.  Expressing their thanks, grateful recipients would say, “That’s mighty liberal of you, Mr. Rogers.”  \r\n\r\nNinety-Five years before public television, Liberality was the salient feature in this particular Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThink of it!  There was a time when the word “liberal” had positive connotations.  Then, along came Eugene V. Debs, William Jennings Bryan, Dorothy Day, T.R., F.D.R., William O. Douglas, M.L. King, George McGovern, Bernie Sanders, et al.  For better or worse, they changed the connotation of the word.  Today, very few public figures dare to embrace the adjective.  Many a Conservative has gotten elected chiefly by pointing at an opponent and yelling, “Liberal!  Liberal!  Liberal!"   Especially in places like Kansas.  A recent book title rightly raised the question, “What’s the Matter with Kansas?"\r\n\r\nFor me, genuine astonishment lingers in connection with Liberal, but not because of the improbability of coming upon such a place-name in a state determinedly red as Kansas. Twenty-five years ago, having landed a gig in Liberal, I flew into Wichita, rented a car and undertook the five-hour, west-bound drive on a highway as unwaveringly straight as a Kansas politician.  \r\n\r\nParts of Ohio may seem flat.  Tain’t so.  You don’t know flatness until you drive across Kansas.  The flatness of Kansas puts the lie to all other flatnesses.  Kansas is as flat as the Earth is round.  Flat, but not without color.  The sky is a depthless blue, the endless corn is Kelly green, broken only when white grain elevators become visible, a distant fleck at first, fully five miles away, seeming to grow as approached, finally towering ten stories high.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I noticed a strange, dark smudge, just above the horizon, far, far ahead.  Like the grain elevators, it seemed to rise, slowly, as I drew nearer but it also spread, slowly, to the south and north of my ‘Westward, ho!'' highway.  \r\n\r\nInexplicably, it rippled in gentle waves, rising and falling like a long, limpid, silken scarf, unimaginably vast, undulating unnaturally in a weirdly lugubrious wind.  I could form no theory to explain what I was seeing.  Was it some bizarre phenomenon of the weather?  A meteorological secret, unique to south-central Kansas?  Could clouds execute such a vast, slow-motion dance-step?  Was I watching the birth-throes of a tornado?\r\n\r\nNo.  It was birds.  Millions upon millions of birds, migrating.  The largest throng of birds I have ever seen or will ever see, winding across the sky in silent majesty.  Silent from a distance, that is.  At length, when I was underneath them, their cries were maddeningly raucous.  The extraordinary sound, which I will never hear again, climaxed as I passed through, then faded as I passed beyond the shifting shadows cast by a quarter billion birds.  \r\n\r\nSilent once more, the undulation came into sight in my rear view mirror, falling further and further behind until becoming, again, only a strange, dark smudge ... receding, fading, shriveling, diminishing at last to the merest wisp on the horizon.  Perhaps an hour after I had first sighted it, the spectacle fell from my sight.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing.  An immense wonder, unfolding with neither prompt nor direction from human beings, simply happening, once again, as it has for thousands and thousands of years, out there in the middle of the continent, a gigantic, living, non-human event taking place, all on its own, high above the prairie.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I ever saw that could compare with it was the Northern Lights.  Like that migrating column of birds, it is something I’ve seen only once.  When I was about seven years old, my parents awakened me one midnight and carried their little, sleepy boy, wrapped in a blanket, outside, to see the Northern Lights.  Like the migration, it was another immense, unfolding wonder, happening entirely on its own, utterly indifferent to us, the little Sowash family, and thus, awe-inspiring.  Faces upturned, mouths open, hushed, we cast our eyes skyward, feeling tenderly toward one another, vulnerable and small.\r\n\r\nAt such moments, the distinctions that seem so important in common hours -- the nuanced distinctions we make between Liberal and Conservative, say -- surrender all significance.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, the Heartland Symphony Orchestra, a spirited community orchestra serving Brainerd and Little Falls, Minnesota — two more good, old, American-sounding place-names — commissioned me to write an orchestral suite in honor of the orchestra''s 35th anniversary.  I wrote a five-movement piece called North Country Suite which they premiered in April of 2012.  \r\n\r\nThe second movement, entitled “Northern Lights,” strives to express the bewildered reverence we feel at those rare moments when we confront the essential truth that only Nature can teach us:  that our brief, tiny lives are acted out upon an unutterably tremendous, unthinkably ancient, imponderably mysterious and almost inconceivably beautiful stage that is not of our making.\r\n\r\nTo hear Josh Aerie conducting the Heartland Symphony Orchestra''s premiere performance of "Northern Lights" from North Country Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 20, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nBefore I set to work, I conferred closely with Josh Aerie.  He apprised me that the orchestra was blessed with a particularly strong trumpeter, oboist, a great French horn section and an exuberant virtuoso timpanist.  Wanting the suite to begin with a bang, I wrote a first movement that prominently features those instruments.\r\n\r\nI opened with a vigorous, almost swashbuckling theme in 7/4, a meter that renders the music a little breathless, a bit off balance, like an enthusiastic amateur snow-shoer.   The music is in G minor, a key that is at once dark and joyful.\r\n\r\nThen things settle down, making way for a contrast.  A hymn-like tune is sounded, varied and developed.  The valiant opening tune returns and, voilà, the two musics are combined, the opposites reconciled.\r\n\r\nMy model for this movement was Sibelius’ Finlandia.  Sibelius being a Finn, that piece, too, has a Northern spirit, with an aggressively rhythmical figure balanced by an ardent Nordic hymn, the two contrasting musics reconciled.  \r\n\r\nSibelius is the 20th-century composer I most admire.  After years of careful listening, I remain astounded by his symphonies and tone poems.  His was a great soul and he managed to express it musically.  And in a remarkable diary entry that gives us an intimate glimpse into the spirituality of a Master.  He wrote:\r\n\r\n"In the evening, working on the symphony … which strangely enchants me.  As if God had thrown down pieces of a mosaic from the floor of heaven and asked me to work out the pattern.  Perhaps a good definition of composing.”\r\n\r\nThese words thrill me almost as much as his music.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Spirit of the North” performed by the Heartland Symphony Orchestra in their premiere performance of North Country Suite, conducted by Josh Aerie, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 9, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne advantage of growing up in Ohio is that you learn about the Moundbuilders, the ancient peoples who built Ohio''s "Indian mounds," as we used to call them.  Ohio history is taught in the fourth grader;  Ohio children  are aware that there were people here long ago.  They know American history didn''t start in 1776 or 1620 or even 1492.\r\n\r\nMay I recommend a book that opened my eyes to the astonishing breadth and depth of this subject?  \r\n\r\n1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles C. Mann. Fascinating!\r\n\r\nAt the time I read it I was writing an orchestral piece, my five-movement North Country Suite, commissioned by Minnesota''s Heartland Symphony.  It prompted me to make the fourth movement an elegy for the ancient forest that once covered all the land from what is now Minnesota to Maine.  It was the greatest hardwood forest that ever was, an unimaginably vast, living giant, all gone except for a few nail trimmings, spared only on hillsides the settlers deemed too steep for farming.  I wanted to evoke that forest and the ancient, vanished cultures that flourished in its shade.\r\n\r\nHow to express such a thing?  A query like that one sparks my creativity.\r\n\r\nThe Moundbuilders, like people everywhere, sang songs and fashioned musical instruments.  We don''t know what their music sounded like; there was no help for me from that source.  I might have studied Native American music of more recent times but that music has no connection with my experience and scant connections with the music of peoples so long forgotten.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to steer clear of the most obvious cliches: the repeated low brass "Heap Big Injun" chords and the menacing tom-toms I heard in the film scores of "Cowboy and Indian" movies I saw in my 1950''s boyhood.  (I loved them at the time!)  I seized on one cliche from those films:  parallel fifths.  You''ll hear them at the beginning and the end of this movement.  I hope I used them in a fresh way.\r\n\r\nI tried to fashion music that, for me at least, draws forth mental images of a vast, ancient, solemn forest, implicitly honoring the forgotten peoples who made it their home for thousands of years. \r\n\r\nYou can hear the movement entitled "Boreal Forest" from my North Country Suite as recorded before an audience of northern Minnesotans (please excuse an occasional cough) in its premiere performance under the baton of Josh Aerie, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a score of the movement by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 8, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),137);

That''s a little awkward in English, so I simplified it to: "We Sang, We Danced."  But it doesn''t mean quite the same thing.  "We used to sing, we used to dance" is a little wistful, something we might say with a sad smile and a sigh for the good old days ... that is what the trio’s Tango movement attempts to express. \r\n\r\nIt is, however, a fiction.  The truth is, I''ve never danced a Tango in my life.  I am not and will never be a person who can look back on the days when I used to go Tango dancing.  Sigh.

In the end, the piece is about my imagining what it might be like to look back and remember having sung and danced the night away, back in the long-lost days of our Youth.\r\n\r\nI must admit, however, that even as I write those words, they seem faintly ridiculous.  Well, so is this Tango, I admit.  Occasionally, I''ve attempted to write music that hovers on the very line that separates an homage from a parody.  This Tango is one such instance.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear this Tango, I wonder what you''ll think?  Will you hear it as a loving homage to a marvelous genre? or will you think that I''m parodying the Tango?  Is it possible for music to be both an homage and a parody?\r\n\r\nSee what you think.  \r\n\r\nI have never heard this trio performed live.  Les Gavottes dis-assembled before they were able to perform it.  It has only been performed in public twice and I was not able to attend either concert.

When Spring arrives, even if only on the calendar, I pull up from memory Vachel Lindsay''s "The Flower-Fed Buffaloes."  It''s not one of those joyful, "Spring is here!" poems.  It''s a hushed reflection on early Spring, prompting us ponder all that has been lost.  \r\n\r\nBuffaloes, for instance.\r\n\r\nStrange to think that, "in the days of long ago," vast herds of buffalo made their way through southwestern Ohio.   Right here where I live, in what is now the edge of downtown Cincinnati, uncountable thousands somehow discerned that, just here, the Ohio River was shallow enough for them to safely traverse each Spring, as the vast herds made their way to fresh pastures.\r\n\r\nThe river, the land, the Spring are all still here but corn, wheat and wheels have replaced the flowers, and the buffaloes that fed on the flower, and the people who fed on the buffaloes.  A whole world that was here, just three lifetimes ago ... vanished.  It''s something to ponder on a grim March day.\r\n\r\nI set the poem to music, back in "the days of long ago," in April of 1975, when I was 25 years old.  The Blues-y tune is unaccompanied by piano or guitar; it''s just a solitary voice, singing simply and powerfully, like the poet''s voice in the poem:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER-FED BUFFALOES\r\n\r\nThe flower-fed buffaloes of the spring\r\nIn the days of long ago,\r\nRanged where the locomotives sing\r\nAnd the prairie flowers like low.\r\nThe tossing, blooming, perfumed grass\r\nIs swept away by wheat,\r\nWheels and wheels and wheels spin by\r\nIn the spring that still is sweet.\r\nBut the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring\r\nLeft us long ago,\r\nThey gore no more, they bellow no more,\r\nThey trundle around these hills no more--\r\nWith the Blackfeet lying low,\r\nWith the Pawnees lying low.\r\n\r\nCan you spare 84 seconds to hear The Flower Fed Buffaloes sung marvelously well by baritone Noel Bouley?

Mary’s lively and gracious manner, her delightful sense of humor and her ardent love of classical music has inspired everyone who crosses her path.  \r\n\r\nIn 1979, Mary took ill and was absent from work for six weeks.

Listen the opening movement of my Trio #2 for clarinet, cello and piano.  It’s the second of thirteen trios I wrote for three French musicians who call themselves "les Gavottes."  I entitled the trio "Enchantement d''avril" (Enchantment of April) because the movements are expansions of songs I had written earlier, setting to music a scene from Elizabeth von Arnim''s novel, "The Enchanted April."  \r\n\r\nYou probably haven''t read the novel;  it''s not very well known; but you may remember the 1993 film Enchanted April, based on the novel.  It''s one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nIf you haven''t read the book or seen the film, well, you certainly know what April is about.\r\n\r\nApril is majestic and miraculous, a kingly re-birth, a meteorological High Renaissance. Accordingly, the movement begins (and ends) with a majestic fanfare; then a rising, trilling clarinet bridges us to a livelier music, though contemplative and pastoral.  Think of this music as a painting, a landscape; soft sheets of gray rain slant across the greening, breeze-tossed branches of trees; clusters of daffodils, gloriously white and yellow, dapple the foreground.\r\n\r\nThe music is in B flat major.  How could it not be?  Such a bright and brassy yellow key!  \r\nwith glimmering highlights of purest white.  At least that''s how B flat major seems to me.  \r\n\r\nYes, I''m one of those for whom keys have colors -- except for C major, which is colorless, clear. F major is pale green.  G major is Kelly green.  E major is bright red.  A major is pale orange while F sharp minor is a gnarled brown.  E flat major is bright blue while E flat minor is deep indigo.  A flat major is purple, F minor even moreso.

I think it could serve as the film score for one of those sweet, little French movies, shot in Paris, about shy people falling in love.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, les Gavottes took to this music because, they told me, it sounded so American!  I remember Lucien, the clarinetist, saying, as we listened to their recording of the work, “This part always makes me think of the American West!”, pantomiming a galloping cowboy, reins in one hand, waving an imaginary hat with the other.  I laughed with him, but what I hear is the French influence.  I guess the music is best described as Franco-American.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with the French language when I was 20, the result of an intense, summer-long affair — a ten-week immersion course at Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nLike any twenty-something, I yearned to visit Paris.  But as the years passed, other priorities forestalled the dream.  College, career, children, mortgage payments, the usual stuff.\r\n\r\nThen one day (as storytellers say), I received a letter from a Parisian clarinetist, Jean-Noel Martin, requesting the sheet music for works he’d heard on a CD recording of my music which he’d found at a Paris record store.  Remember record stores?\r\n\r\nI sent him the scores for free and we became pen-pals.  I''d write to him in French; he''d reply in English, both of us practicing our second languages.  This was before e-mail.  Remember letters?\r\n\r\nAfter two years he invited me to come over.  I was thrilled!  Jean-Noel met me at Charles DeGaulle airport and squired me back to his tiny apartment to show me how things worked there.  He moved out, lodged with a friend during my eleven-day visit, letting me use his flat.  All for free.  Un vrai ami!\r\n\r\nHis apartment was tiny; the bed occupied two-thirds of the floor space.  It was on the fifth floor of one of those classic old Parisian apartment buildings.  There was no elevator.  The toilet-closet was down the hall, shared with the floor’s other tenants.  The hallway light switch was timed to turn itself off after 90 seconds;  unless you could find a light switch again, you made the return journey from the toilet-closet in pitch darkness.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment had a tiny sink, a two-burner hot plate, a refrigerator the size of a waste-basket, a tiny desk, and book shelves on every inch of the walls.  Its one window, viewless, looked out only upon the building’s opposite wing.  I loved everything about it! \r\n\r\nI didn’t see much of Jean-Noel after the first day;  he had his job, lessons to teach, rehearsals to attend.  In two or three brief rendezvous, he gave me written lists of suggested activities and sites to visit with directions, things to seek out, notice, appreciate.\r\n\r\nEvery day, I walked and walked and walked, exploring as many neighborhoods as possible.  I was 41 by that time, but in good shape.  Even so, there were afternoons when my tired legs forced me back to the apartment, just to put up my feet and rest, poring over guide books the while.\r\n\r\nParis was marvelous, exhilarating.  The architecture, cafés, parks, museums, monuments, people, the Métro, the beautiful language.  Things ‘clicked’ for me, dozens of times, every day.  I stumbled upon a street named the Rue Nicot.  A little sign explained that it was named for Jean Nicot who introduced tobacco to the French, presenting it to the queen mother, Catherine de Medici, a cure for her migraines.  Fashionable people took up the practice and Nicot became a celebrity.  Thus originated the word ... “nicotine.”\r\n\r\nI’ve always hated smoking, but this was fascinating.  it’s one example of how my understanding of things large and small was expanded by a myriad of minute discoveries made daily in Paris.\r\n\r\nI became obsessed with a desire to return … and I’ve managed to get back to France seven times since that first visit in 1991.  Sometimes alone, sometimes with wife and children, sometimes with friends.  \r\n\r\nLa Belle France has enriched my life, immensely.  And inspired me, too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my affection and gratitude is expressed in this Franco-American music.

It is a setting of six beautiful, pure, simple poems by Sarah Teasdale, about a woman''s responses to love.  \r\n\r\nToo, I wrote the piece as a performance vehicle for married friends -- a soprano and a cellist.  They were a lovely pair in those days and the piece expressed the lovely quality everyone saw in their relationship, though it did not last.  Strangely, the poems touch on the transience of love, too, though I did not think about that at the time.  I’ll include the poems below.\r\n\r\nOne time in Paris, I played this piece for a French soprano, trying to play the cello part on the piano and singing the songs as best I could, roughly translating into French as I went along.  That was a challenge!  When I finished, she asked me to play it again.  Midway through, she suddenly made a strange choking sound.  I thought she was laughing.  I looked around to find that she had burst into tears.  It was a little unsettling for us both, but one of the best compliments ever given to my music.  \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago the cycle was recorded by Susan Olson, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on my vocal music.  The only people who have heard this piece have been those in attendance, here and there, when it has been performed live.  Sharing music with you through these mpFrees has allowed works like this to come to the ears of friends and fans who would never hear it otherwise.  I am deeply grateful to have this technology and to have an audience for it in the form of the recipients of these mpFree messages.\r\n\r\nAt 12 min., 15 seconds, the piece is a little longer than those I usually send but I hope you will take the time to listen to it all the way through.  The loveliest moments are toward the end, as sadness overtakes the love story, though for a composer the most poignant line is certainly the first one:  A little while when I am gone my life will live in music after me....\r\n\r\n4/27/14  To hear mezzo Susan Olson sing Bright April, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 27, 2014\r\n\r\nBelow is the text for Bright April for lyric soprano and cello (1980) \r\nThe poems are by Sarah Teasdale.\r\n	1.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(20,replace(replace('Sage''s Ravine is the third movement of a large work I wrote in 1992 entitled, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail for violin, French horn, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nThe four places are depicted in the order in which a northern bound thru-hiker would encounter them:\r\n\r\nI.  Amicalola Falls - a 400-foot cascade in northern Georgia\r\nII.  Dragon’s Tooth – an outcropping in Virginia, shaped like a giant canine tooth\r\nIII.  Sage’s Ravine – a darkly shaded slice on the border of Connecticut and Massachusetts\r\nIV.  Katahdin – the northern terminus of the trail in Maine\r\n\r\nI have hiked through Sage''s Ravine.  I didn''t encounter any sages there, but I like to fancy that it''s a place where sages might be encountered -- New England sages, modern day Emerson’s and Thoreau’s. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is a sage?  What makes someone a sage? What do sages do?\r\n\r\nIn the words of Odell Shepard, a latter-day New England sage whose writings I admire, a sage "thinks freely --  not as the member of any party, organization, institution, religion, caste, class, nation, or club, not as one having a reputation to gain or support, but simply as one man with his center inside himself, answerable to nothing but the truth ... such thinking as this [is] the hardest work and the finest sport in the world.”\r\n\r\nWhat do they think about, these sages?  They ponder the reconciliation of opposites:  joy and sorrow, good and evil, the sacred and the profane. They strive to perceive the larger whole that contains those opposites.\r\n\r\nFrom birth we are confronted with opposites:  wake and sleep, day and night, hungry and full, mother and father.  Later, we devise mental constructs to help us grapple with more complex opposites:  young and old, past and future, boy and girl, right and wrong.  We cannot unite into a larger whole any of the opposites we encounter in life; we can only try to arrange them into an order that makes some sense.\r\n\r\nFor Western societies, the reconciliation of opposites is a theological problem.  How can an omnipotent, loving God allow the existence of evil?  If God does not create evil, then is it self-creating? implying that God is not omnipotent after all?  \r\n\r\nThe believer must simultaneously accept two contradicting ideas:  the goodness of God and the existence of Evil.  For many people, including a few whom I love, this is impossible.  For them, the existence of Evil obviates the existence of God.  \r\n\r\nThey ask, "If God is God, then how can Evil be?  How can we thank God when good things happen but exculpate God when bad things happen?"\r\n\r\nTheologians posit various responses.  But most believers -- I am one -- only shrug and say, "We just do, that''s all."\r\n\r\nGod is good, yet Evil exists.  These two opposing assertions create a strain in all of us, believers and non-believers alike.  It affects everything, including the way our artists shape their work and the way we respond to their work.\r\n\r\nThe stress of our inability to reconcile these opposites resonates when we encounter a work of art that succeeds in reconciling opposites into a coherent and pleasing pattern, be it a painting, a play or a musical composition.  It seems to me that Western art, when it achieves this, is at its very best.  Indeed, it seems to be the principal difference between the relatively few artistic  expressions that touch my heart and the many other expressions to which I am indifferent.\r\n\r\nTo cite the most famous example:  think of Mona Lisa''s smile emerging from that dreary landscape.  There are myriad others:  remember how skillfully and satisfyingly Cezanne''s greens reconcile his opposing blues and oranges?  and the way his forms are depicted simultaneously from differing points of view?  those apparently twisted tables, tilting teapots, floating apples and oranges?  \r\n\r\nOpposites are everywhere in Western music;  the works of Bach and Beethoven are replete with them:  jerky vs. smooth, energetic vs. plaintive, loud vs. soft, fast vs. slow, major vs. minor, the opposing tonic and dominant keys of a fugue or the sonata-allegro form.  \r\n\r\nThe most salient characteristics of Shakespeare''s characters are their ambiguities -- those wise fools, those flawed heroes, those villains who, maddeningly, mouth such good advice --  they are believable precisely because they are contradictory!  And we love the Bard for having gifted us with them. \r\n\r\nHere at least, we feel, here at last -- if rarely in Life -- we find opposites reconciled and we rejoice in it!.  \r\n\r\n(Contrariwise, the absence of opposites in a work of art renders it boring.  We quickly tire of a flawless hero, a relentlessly villainous villain, a merely foolish fool, a painter who cannot take us beyond a narrow spectrum of form and color, a repetitive pop song with a never-varying beat, a cramped melodic range and the same, tired chords  --  boring!) \r\n\r\nIn Sage''s Ravine, I tried to depict sagacity by attempting to reconcile two opposing musics -- the music of sorrow and the music of joy.  First comes the sorrowful music -- slow, mournful, in a minor key.  Then comes a quietly joyous music, a tune that conjoins elements of Jesu, Joy of Man''s Desiring with the American folksong Shenandoah.  The opposites are established, repeated, and finally reconciled in what I hope is a coherent and pleasing pattern.\r\n\r\nTo hear Sages Ravine, beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nYou can see a PDF of the score by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2012, public radio station WMRA of Harrisonburg, VA broadcast an interview with me about my Four Places on the Appalachian Trail on a program called "The Spark."  I want to thank producer Martha Woodroof and host Bob Satterwhite for permission to share this interview with my friends and fans.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the interview, go to this page:  \r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/vistas.html\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 4, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nDragon’s Tooth!  That’s the name of a dramatic upthrust of rock, atop a remote mountain ridge in southwestern Virginia.  Its topmost tip offers a 360-degree view, one of very few on the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nYou don’t casually stroll up there for a look-see.  Dragon’s Tooth is very hard to get to, a long, steep, upward clamber, especially difficult when carrying, as I did, a 45-pound backpack full of gear and food for an eight-day, 80-mile hike.  I made that hike with a group of friends when I was in my mid-thirties, trim and fit.  Even so, it just about did me in.  That 80-mile hike was the most physically challenging thing I’ve done.\r\n\r\nDragon’s Tooth is all about energy.  Energy to get up there.  And the immense energy of the Dragon, asleep under the mountain, his one, huge, ruthless tooth protruding.  When he awakes, Lord help us!\r\n\r\nThe music I wrote about the place has a lot of energy, too.  It’s the second movement of my Suite for violin, French horn, cello and piano, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the oldest myths of Western Civilization:  a dragon guarding a great prize, be it a beautiful princess or a treasure of gems, jewelry and gold.  It’s a static situation; the energy is kinetic.  What’s needed is a hero to slay the dragon, fructify the princess and/or redistribute the hoard.  Sure enough, a hero always arrives, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nAs with all great myths, it’s happening right now in the most intimate of human relations as well as the most public.\r\n\r\nMost likely, you know or have known instances of it.  I have.  I was once the close friend of a beautiful, childless princess/treasure/woman whose dragon/husband was selfish, sarcastic and neglectful.  I’m not in the business of rescuing princesses, but it wasn’t long before a suitable hero came along.  He rescued the princess and the two of them have been together now for about fifteen years.  The relationship has been, so I hear, fruitful and rewarding for both of them.\r\n\r\nThe Dragon myth speaks to public life as well.  It offers a dark warning to The One Percent.  Sooner or later, your hoarded treasure will be forcibly released from your grasp.  Your gated communities will not avail you.  The only question is whether your wealth will be redistributed peacefully (by means of taxation) or violently (by means of riots, revolution, the guillotine).  It''s the tax or the ax.  One or the other.  Only a matter of time.  Me, I''d advocate the peaceful means, but it’s not up to me to decide!  Who listens to a composer’s thoughts on such matters?  It’s just as well.  I don''t want the responsibility.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear evocations of the Dragon-Princess/Treasure-Hero myth in this music … the fierce energy of the dragon, the allure of the princess/treasure, the valor of the hero, the inexorability of Fate.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Dragon’s Tooth,”  beautifully performed by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApril 17, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAt this moment, while I’m sitting here, writing, and you’re sitting there, reading, some two thousand backpackers are in the first days and weeks of what they hope will be a ’thru-hike’ of the fabled Appalachian Trail.  Early spring is when hikers head north from the southern terminus of the trail, in Georgia’s Amicalola Falls State Park.\r\n\r\nTheir friends or families drive them there, spend one last day together, take in the sights of the park; many dine and sleep in the park’s lodge.  Next morning, they see their loved ones off with a good luck wish, a last embrace, a wave of farewell.\r\n\r\nI imagine the feelings of the soon-to-be hiker, family and friends, gathered at the foot of Amicalola Falls, gazing upward at the tallest cascade in southeastern America, more than four times higher than Niagara.  The hiker, perhaps a young son or daughter, a middle-aged adventurer or a newly retired grandpa or grandma, is excited, happy, eager to begin the trek they’ve long planned and dreamed.  The well-wishers are wistful and a little anxious, especially if they are parents.  How well I know that feeling.\r\n\r\nI tried to express this range of feelings in “Amicalola Falls," the opening movement of my suite for French horn, violin, cello and piano entitled, Four Places on the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nI’ve been to Amicalola Falls, scrambled up the ever-wet, slippery stairs, surrendered my eyes to the fascination of the plunging cascades.  “There’s three things you never get tired of watching,” a wise friend once said.  “A flickering flame, water in motion and a baby’s face."\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, I''ve heard the A.T.’s ‘clarion call of adventure.’  Shortly, you’ll hear it, too; there are lots of "horn calls" in the opening movement.  I never heard it more clearly than at Amicalola Falls where so many would-be thru-hikers set out with high hopes of reaching Katahdin, the trail’s northern terminus, 2100 miles distant, way up in Maine.  \r\n\r\nHiking the entire A.T. was a dream I once cherished; now I know I never will.  "It’s all good,” as young people say.  I''ve hiked various segments of the trail in GA, NC, VA, CT, MA and VT, about 250 miles in all.  I served as a trail-worker for two ten-day stints at Konnarock, the A.T. volunteer basecamp in Virginia.  I produced a CD, “Music for the Appalachian Trail,” donating a portion of the profits to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the group that oversees and protects the trail.  And I wrote this suite.\r\n\r\nWriting the suite took about as long as a thru-hike — four months — and I fancied, as I was writing it, that I was making the journey, vicariously.  The four places are depicted in the order thru-hikers encounter them:  Amicalola Falls in GA, where the trail begins,  the rock outcropping named ''Dragon’s Tooth'' in VA, Sage’s Ravine on the border of CT and MA and finally, the goal from the start, Katahdin.\r\n\r\nGrand vistas are suggested often in this music, the big views the hiker comes upon, a relief from the long tunnels of green.  I also included many quieter, more intimate, delicate passages, to express those moments when a hiker stops to gaze in wonder at the saffron-colored lichen on the rocks, a glistening spider''s web or fern fronds dripping dew in the buttery morning light.  \r\n\r\nThe musical motive representing Katahdin is heard in the opening bar of the first movement; only it''s sort of upside down and backwards.  To my way of thinking, it makes sense that the southern end of the trail and the beginning of the suite would consist of the same notes that will be heard in a reverse or retro form at the end of the piece, when the music depicts the northern end of the trail.\r\n\r\nFurther, to emphacize the opposite ends of the trail and the piece, the waterfall is evoked in descending, cascading figures, while the Katahdin motive, when it finally emerges at the beginning of the last movement, is a jagged, rising figure .  But the two musical gestures are, in fact, the same — the trail is perceived from opposite termini and from two places in between.  \r\n\r\nListen for the ''moonlight'' section in the first movement, in a rapid 5/4 time, beginning at 2:28.  It has a  floating, almost meter-less character, a contrast to the rugged, rocky, four-square music on either side of it.  \r\n\r\nTo hear “Amicalola Falls” from Four Places on the Appalachian Trail played by violinist Cheryl Trace, French hornist Robert Garcia, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 26, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),63);

It''s one of the most delightful pieces to have come through me. \r\n\r\nBellville is the village in north central Ohio where I met my future wife, fell in love with her, courted, married and lived for twelve years.  Our two children were born there.  I loved Bellville during those years.\r\n\r\nI was 27 years old in 1977 and it was one of the best years of my life.  I had no regular job and was painting houses, off and on, for most of that happy year;  I had plenty of spare time.  I wrote some of the best music of my career.  I earnestly tried to create a musical style that would express my immediate environs:  Bellvillle, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nThe challenge of figuring out how to express my immediate location inspired me.  I thought that music composed in an Ohio village ought to sound subtly different than music written in, say, Nebraska or Vermont.  I undertook to become a Regionalist composer.  No one had ever attempted such a thing in Bellville, Ohio!  I was a pioneer!\r\n	\r\nRegionalism has been a major force in American literature and painting, and also in American music.  Charles Ives’ programmatic pieces express his New England, just as Gershwin’s jagged, sky-line melodies and Bernstein’s big-city rhythms express New York City; Oklahoman Roy Harris’ Third Symphony captures the massive spaciousness of the Great Plains; Ferde Grofe’s dear, old, Western-sounding Grand Canyon Suite conjurs that landscape perfectly;  Aaron Copland caught the Midwest in The Tender Land, the West in Rodeo and Billy the Kid, New England in his Suite from Our Town and the Blue Ridge Mountains in Appalachian Spring (oh, I know he didn''t name that piece until after it was completed but listeners everywhere envision the Appalachians when they hear that music).\r\n\r\nEach of these composers evoked particular American landscapes.  Their best-loved regionalist works have found a place in the hearts of music-loving audiences all over the world.  \r\n\r\nI studied these works and took a lesson from them.  My piano trio, Four Seasons in Bellville, was the best result.  The tunes are lyrical and abundant, the harmonies lush and rich, like the fabled soil of Richland County, Ohio, where Bellville is located.  Richland County’s topsoil is sometimes eight feet deep!  The best vegetable garden we ever had was in our backyard in Bellville.\r\n	\r\nThis trio is a four-movement work, of course, one for each season.  Music about Spring must suggest color, movement, growth and romantic love.  Think of wild flowers, refreshing rains, filmy, yellow-y, breeze-tossed branches and burgeoning streams.  \r\n\r\nTo hear "Spring" from Four Seasons in Bellville, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 11, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nSummer in rural Ohio is a robust time for the plants; gardens grow like crazy, the leaves on the trees are a bright Kelly green.  It’s an energetic season for humans, too:  picnicking, hiking, boating and fishing, baseball, summer camps, Fourth of July fireworks, county fairs, long, bright days.\r\n\r\nI ought to know because I lived in rural, north central Ohio for forty-four years before moving to Cincinnati in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn my twenties and early thirties I aimed to express my immediate environs in my music, to wit, Bellville, Ohio, the village where we lived.  How I loved Bellville in those days!  It was where I met my future wife, where she had grown up, where we fell in love, courted, married and lived for twelve years.  It was the village to which we brought home from the Mansfield hospital our two newborns. \r\n\r\nMusic written in and about an Ohio village ought to sound different, I thought, from music written in and about villages in, say, Oregon, Nebraska or Vermont.  I sought to imbue my music with the lush verdure of rural Ohio and the sense of abundance that arises from the fertility of topsoil that''s eight feet deep!  I wanted my music to convey vigorous good health and the feelings that arose from the rolling land around us, a quilt of thick forests and fields of corn, the green leaves and yellow tassels glistening in the sun between frequent and delicious rains.\r\n\r\nI thought I’d live a long life there, then die and be buried in the Bellville cemetery.  But in time we came to feel that we’d exhausted the resources of the place.  Twenty-one years ago we moved to Cincinnati so that our children could attend the School for the Creative and Performing Arts.  We’ll never exhaust the resources of the Queen City, a richly blessed and generously endowed cultural center which has been very good to me, to us.\r\n\r\nMy Piano Trio #1 is touchstone, a reminder of who we were and where we were in the summer of 1977.\r\n\r\nTo hear the exuberant Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) superbly playing the “Summer” movement from my Piano Trio #1 “Four Seasons in Bellville,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 26, 2015\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),71);

Those are journey forms:  you''re here, you depart, you come back.  That simple.  \r\n\r\nSimpler yet:  theme & variations.  A tune gets repeated, each time differently.

Presenting such gifts, we don''t expect cash or a barter item in return.  The mention of cash or a hinted expectation of receiving a bartered item in return would be insulting.

With us, it''s a way of life.\r\n\r\nWhen our kids were little, a friend was part owner of an historic hotel in Cape May, NJ, which allowed him three weeks of free lodging each year.  Like most rich people, he was too busy and never took advantage of the opporunity.  He kindly offered the free lodging to our family.  We joyfully accepted!   Each summer for seven years we passed three idyllic weeks in beautiful, quaint, historic, Victorian Cape May.\r\n\r\nWe had some of the best times of our lives there, strolling streets lined with lovingly restored homes, enjoying the gardens, picnicking at the Cape May Point Lighthouse, looking for Cape May ''diamonds,'' semi-precious gems that wash up on the beach.  I bought a bag of plastic toy pirate coins and tossed them, one by one, in the sand just ahead of our little son, when he wasn''t looking; he had the fun of finding them.\r\n\r\nEach morning, I''d get up very early (I''ve always been an early riser), slip out to a bakery, buy almond croissants for the family, return to our room to leave them on the dresser, then stroll the beach at my leisure, noticing things, humming to myself and thinking about music as the dawn gave way to day.\r\n\r\nThat was the origin of "Morning at Seaside," the opening movement of my four-movement Cape May Suite.  The cello opens with five notes depicting a wave hovering and then crashing, followed by a longer, rising phrase suggesting a larger heave of water behind it, also making a rising, hovering, then crashing motion.

He’s going to yammer on about movements when the Nation is wrenched with grisly news of murder and mayhem and the vitally important issues of racism and the containment of violence demand our attention?”  Yes, I am.  Why?  Because one appropriate and healthy way of responding to horror, racism and violence is to affirm the value of the good things we all cherish — among which are music, friendship and community. ]\r\n\r\nA movement is a section of a larger work.  A short silence separates it from preceding and following movements.  A movement is a completed expression and can stand alone. But the logic of its existence is stronger when it is heard in its place, among the other movements in the larger work of which it is a part.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of movements in a multi-movement work is not random.  The sequence is devised to provide contrasts in tempo and character as the listener journeys through the entire work.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the first movement of a concerto is usually moderately fast and expansive in character;  the second movement is usually slow, sensitive, introspective;  the third movement is usually fast and rousing, a shameless bid for a big round of applause after the last note is sounded.  (Most concertos have three movements, most symphonies four.)\r\n\r\nThe differing character of the movements is not random either.  The movements must be diverse, but not too diverse.  Unless the composer is going for humor or irony, a funeral march ought not to be followed by a polka.  Different as the movements may be from one another, they still need to be in some way unified, a sum greater than its parts.  \r\nComposers are fascinated by things like this.  But I have noticed that the eyes of non-composers glaze over pretty quickly when the conversation turns to musical structure.\r\n\r\nPeople need a metaphor to which they can relate.  Understandable!\r\n\r\nHere’s one:  think of a multi-movement piece of music as a series of related paintings by the same artist, displayed together.  The wall space between the paintings corresponds to the brief silences between the movements.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve hung paintings, you know that there is an art to it.  It’s a tricky business, balancing several paintings so as to please the eye.  There is a mysterious tension between the paintings, arising from their size and content.  \r\n\r\nIt’s the same with movements.  Composing is not only a matter of coming up with good tunes.  Songwriters do that and hats off to them.  But composers are concerned with the ways in which music compels and rewards careful listening over an extended period of time.  That is achieved partly through the distribution of contrasting movements.\r\n\r\nThere are four movements in my Cape May Suite for oboe, violin, cello and piano.  The first and last, entitled “Morning at Seaside” and “Ghostly Waltzes at Congress Hall,” are long, about eight minutes, and scored for all four instruments.  The music in those movements has an expansive, public character.  \r\n\r\nBy contrast the two inner movements, entitled “Dinner at Louisa’s” and “Couple in a Victorian Garden,” are short, two or three minutes long.  Both are scored for just two instruments and have a quiet, private character.  “Dinner at Louisa’s,” depicting a couple dining in a small, intimate restaurant, is scored for cello and piano.  “Couple in a Victorian Garden” is scored for the other two instruments:  oboe and violin.\r\n\r\nReturning to the analogy of paintings on a wall, the outer movements are like two large paintings while the inner movements are like two small paintings.  Think how you might arrange two large paintings and two small paintings, hanging all four on the same wall.  \r\n\r\nThat was part of what I was thinking about when I assembled my Cape May Suite.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, our daughter, Shenandoah, who was 11 years old when I wrote this music, was captivated by the “Couple in a Victorian Garden” movement.  She listened to the recording of it many times and often told me, “Papa, that is the most beautiful music you ever wrote.”   Mind you, at that time she had heard relatively few of my 400 works but she was, typically for her, completely confident in making this pronouncement.  That’s our girl!\r\n\r\nSee what you think.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Couple in a Victorian Garden" from my Cape May Suite played by oboist Robert Franz and violinist Brendan Christensen, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 10, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),60);

"I''ll help you."  (He called me Stoogahtz; I never knew why.)\r\n\r\nBetween my 7th and 12th grades, those two teachers taught me 90% of what a composer needs to know.  That''s how strong the music program was in the 1960''s in the public school system of Lexington, Ohio (pop. 4,000).\r\n\r\nMr. Evans was a composer, too, though with a very narrowly defined style.  He wrote short, modal choral works that drew on the musical legacy of his Welsh ancestors.  He instructed me at length, often after school on his own time, teaching me music history, music theory, counterpoint, harmony, orchestration.  Mr. Dunlap did, too.  \r\n\r\nA young man needs an older man, who is outside his family, to affirm him, to let him know that he has value, that he has gifts to bring to the world.  Those two teachers, along with my Scoutmaster Frank Culp and a few others, did that for me.  In turn, I’ve tried to do the same for many younger men in the course of my life.  Indeed, I continue to do this at the school where I teach.    \r\nI learned so much from those two music teachers that in my senior year I was able to write a melodramatic tone poem and to conduct our high school orchestra in the first (and only, thank goodness!) performance.  Looking back, I realize that it wasn’t a very good piece of music but the act of writing it and conducting it was a very big step for me.\r\n\r\nThere was one issue on which Mr. Evans and I could never agree.  We had long, good-natured arguments about musical style.  Mr. Evans felt that a composer should find his one, true style and stick with it.  I disagreed passionately.  What fun would that be?  \r\n\r\n"What if I feel like writing something in the style of Wagner or Gershwin or Mozart?"\r\n\r\n"Why would you want to do that?"\r\n\r\n"Because it''s fun, that''s why!"\r\n\r\n"But you''re not Wagner or Gershwin or Mozart.  You''re Rick Sowash.  Figure out what Rick Sowash''s music ought to sound like and then write that."\r\n\r\nWorking within a narrow style suited Mr. Evans; for me, that would have been suffocating, a self-imposed prison sentence.\r\n\r\nAs a composer, I’ve never fussed about my “style.”  When ideas sought me out I brought them to reality as best I could, never considering whether or not I was being consistent with my style, whatever that might be.  \r\n\r\nFrankly, I don''t think I have a compositional style.  Yet friends tell me that when they hear my music on the radio, they know it''s mine -- because they recognize my style!  Go figure.\r\n\r\nIt''s a strange thing to step back and consider one''s own life''s work.  For a long time, your life’s work something that is ahead of you.  Then it’s something you’re in the middle of.  At length, it becomes pretty much a done deal, a thing that is mostly behind you.\r\n\r\nWhat''s to be said about my life''s work? this stuff I''ve birthed into being?  It''s often fun; it often makes people smile, humorously or poignantly.  It always sounds American, that''s for sure.  No surprises there.  Making people smile gives me joy and, having lived my whole life in mid-America, my music is bound to sound American.  \r\n\r\nWhat about my ethnic heritage?  If Mr. Evans'' music grew out of his Welsh heritage, then out of what heritages did my music grow?\r\n\r\nMy father''s ancestors were French; I speak and teach French and I adore France; some of my work sounds a little French-y.  My mother''s parents were Austro-Hungarians, from the region that is called Serbia today, though they considered themselves Germans, not Serbs.   Sure enough, an Eastern European sound sometimes pops up in my music as well.  \r\n\r\nListen to this, for instance:  a short, bluesy cello cadenza is followed by a "Galop" that blends my American and Eastern European musical DNAs.  It''s the second movement of my Piano Trio #2 "Orientale and Galop," as recorded by the incomparable Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen) for whom it was composed and to whom it is dedicated.  \r\n\r\nI don''t know how to categorize the style of this music but, true to form, it sounds American and it’s a whole lot of fun.

It''s said that when friends entered Brahms'' apartment after he died, they found Scott Joplin''s "Maple Leaf Rag" on the Master''s piano.  Brahms must have been intrigued by this new American music!\r\n\r\nEleven and a half decades later, the popularity of Ragtime has not faded.  It''s a musical perennial.\r\n\r\nMy woodwind quintet, Three American Perennials (1974), contributes to three musical genres of which Americans have never tired:  folk dances, sea chanteys and ragtime.  \r\n\r\nRags are usually scored for solo piano but part of the fun of this piece is hearing a rag played, improbably, by the five ill-matched instruments, each very different from the rest, that comprise the woodwind quintet.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of original tunes comes, at the very end, "Jolly Redwing," played by the French horn in counterpoint to everything else that''s going on.

What would you consider to be the greatest spectator sport in the country today?  Would you say it’s basketball?  baseball?  football?  It’s politics. That’s right, politics.  Millions and millions of people, following it every day … They know the names and the numbers of all the players.”\r\n\r\nHe’s right!  What a spectacle!  Never boring.  And so much more at stake than with mere ball games.  Of what consequence is a sports victory, after all?  How will our lives be any different, win or lose, after “the big game?”  Contrariwise, the consequences of American elections are global.\r\n\r\nThe perennial presidential election process is a dizzying whirl of sweeping promises, comic blunders, shrewd calculations, stupid ideas that “seemed good at the time,” the bartering of cash for influence.  Every time, we hear the boast: “I don’t need their cash!”  Don’t you believe it!  Then there’s the sign-making, flag-waving, door-to-dooring, ringing endorsements, bombastic trumpeting, the glorification of buffoonery.  \r\n\r\nEvery election cycle we are assured that, this time, it’s “a battle for the very heart and soul of the country.”  Oh yes, it''s a stark choice between the abyss if their candidate wins and paradise-on-earth if our candidate wins.  Afterwards, neither is realized.  They must now be RE-elected because:  “We’ve come a long way, but we have a long way to go!”  \r\n\r\nThink of it!  The thing steams on for almost two years before the actual vote, picking up momentum, accelerando e crescendo poco a poco.  \r\n\r\nSporting matches, by contrast, last a couple of hours, tops.\r\n\r\nThe zaniness of American political life springs from — what else? — the frenetic energy of our intense, outspoken, multiloquent populace.   \r\n\r\nWe the People bubble and rumble with joy and disgust, hope and despair, laughter and bitterness.  What sports fan emotes as deeply as the impassioned politico?\r\n\r\nAmerican political life would be insufferable if it weren’t so fascinating, so entertaining.\r\n\r\nHow to express, musically, this tumble-jumble, this rannygazoo of immense assurances and petty connivance?   \r\n\r\nWay back in 1974, during the doomed presidency of Richard Nixon, I took a shot at expressing precisely that tumble-jumble in the first of my Three American Perennials for woodwind quintet, a salmagundi of original folk-like tunes set alongside authentic American folk-tunes including “Old Dan Tucker,” “Camptown Races” and, at the very end, ironically, “Simple Gifts.”\r\n\r\nWhy do I say ironically?  That strong and simple Shaker tune gets touted as being somehow emblematic of America.  In a way it is, sure.  We love that tune and what Aaron Copland did with it in his “Appalachian Spring.”  \r\n\r\nBut while this American life — particularly our political life -- gifts us with constant, peppery, dangerous entertainment, it is anything but simple.  \r\n\r\nOnce only in my composing career, in writing this exuberant, chaotic first movement, have I tried to convey an aural image of political complexity energized to the edge of insanity.  Accordingly, the music is acrid, almost sinister, a little harsh but somehow good-hearted.  Then and now, especially during presidential campaigns, that''s how American society seems to me.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the end, at 3:33, you’ll hear the French horn ripping out six glissandos. Think of those as the trumpetings of the Republican elephant.  Are they a shrill heralding of victory?  or shrieks of despair at the realization that, for the coming term, while the losing side is mired in the Slough of Despond, the victors will hold the office that was so hotly contested?  I couldn’t say.  Music itself has no party affiliation.\r\n\r\nRight after the last horn glissando the movement abruptly ends with a snatch of “Simple Gifts.”   \r\n\r\nSimple?  America?  "AS IF!"   \r\n\r\nGive a listen to HarmoniaV, a Connecticut wind quintet, giving a spirited, witty and extraordinarily precise rendition -- these guys are really good! -- of the first movement by clicking on the link above. \r\n\r\nYou can also click on the link above to see a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 28, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),48);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(26,replace(replace('In 2011, my clarinet concerto was performed and recorded by David Drosinos and the St. Petersburg Symphony.  For me, it was a big deal.  It was the first of my orchestral works to be recorded and the only one performed by a major European orchestra. \r\n\r\nHere''s how it happened ....\r\n\r\nIn 1991, I made my first trip to Paris, where I befriended French clarinetist Lucien Aubert.  He asked me to write several pieces for him -- a quintet for clarinet and strings, two reed trios and a piece called Voyage of the Spirit which turned out to be the first of no less than thirteen clarinet, cello and piano trios I was to write for Lucien over the next decade and a half.\r\n\r\nI had already written for clarinet and liked the instrument very much but when Lucien requested these pieces, I concentrated on the instrument.  To date, I''ve written 51 works featuring the clarinet.  For me, it has come to be an autobiographical instrument.  For better or worse, I see my character and personality reflected in the clarinet;  it can be foolish or wise, sarcastic or noble, trite or impassioned, funny or dead earnest.  Same goes for your friend, the undersigned.\r\n\r\nFinding ways to couple the clarinet and the cello, with the piano as a backdrop, proved so compelling that I almost could not stop writing works for that combination of instruments.  There was so much to explore, so many possibilities.  That''s why I''ve written more for that combination of instruments than for any other.\r\n\r\nStylistically, the thirteen trios zig-zag wildly as they progress;  each is in some way the opposite of its predecessor.  Taken altogether, they form a trajectory, aiming all along at my epic-length clarinet concerto, though I did not realize it at the time I was writing these trios.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, when I was about half-way through the writing of my thirteen trios, my Italian-American clarinetist friend Angelo Santoro asked me to write a one-movement work for clarinet and orchestra which he could premiere with the Cincinnati Community Orchestra.  I complied with The View from Carew, a Romance for clarinet and orchestra.\r\n\r\nAngelo premiered it, playing beautifully as he always does, a noble presence with his silver mustache and black tuxedo.  Afterwards he informed me that the Romance was destined to be the slow, middle movement of a full-length three-movement concerto and that now I must write the other two movements!  He kept after me, phoning me every couple months to ask how the concerto was coming along.  Finally, in the summer of 2007 I accepted the challenge of writing the substantial outer movements that an expansive middle movement would require.\r\n\r\nI wanted the concerto to be like a large mural in a public place.  I wanted it to express suitably large ideas.  I wanted to affirm my conviction that tonality, tunefulness and traditional musical architecture are as powerfully expressive as ever in our 21st century.  I wanted the concerto to convey optimism, friendship, love of Nature; I wanted it to brim with joy.  I wanted it to sound American, to evoke our country''s spaciousness and potential, mixing elements of folk music and jazz and extending the film score devices of the great Hollywood westerns. \r\n\r\nI wanted the solo clarinet''s relationship with the orchestra to be that of a friend and a teacher -- not an adversary.  I wanted the clarinet to present gifts to the orchestra -- exuberant, celebratory tunes that the orchestra could joyfully “learn” and play in turn.  Most of all, I wanted you, the listeners, to experience the piece as a gift, a most welcome gift.\r\n\r\nI became so excited writing this piece that there were times when sleep evaded me.  I could not turn off the music that came pouring into my head.  Some days I worked for nine hours straight, resenting the pauses I had to make in order to eat or visit the bathroom!\r\n\r\nBy winter, the concerto was complete and, thanks to a grant Angelo got from the Cincinnati Foundation, he premiered it the following April with the Clermont Philharmonic, the community orchestra he founded many years ago.\r\n\r\nI wanted clarinetists to know about this piece.  Googling assiduously, I found the names and email addresses of a couple hundred clarinet professors.  I sent each a cheery email, introducing myself and the concerto, attaching an mp3 of Angelo''s performance and a PDF of the score.\r\n\r\nA half dozen responded.  A month later, one of those, David Drosinos of Baltimore, MD, was asked by the conductor of the St. Petersburg Symphony if he would like to record a CD with that orchestra and if he knew of any new American clarinet concerto that had not yet been recorded.  "Do I ever!" he replied and they recorded mine.  \r\n\r\nDo you imagine that these things just happen?  No.  Recording is how post-Soviet orchestras survive without the government support they once enjoyed.  David, bless his heart, funded the entire project out of his retirement savings.   The expense was enormous.  You would be shocked to know the amount.  When I thanked him, he said, "Well, what else could I do to advance my career? rent Carnegie Hall and do a recital?  What would that mean to anybody, really?  This way, I got to do the premiere recording with a major orchestra of a concerto I really like.  And, from now on, whenever your concerto is broadcast on American classical radio stations, my name will be mentioned as the soloist."  \r\n\r\nTrue enough.  Thank you, David, with all my heart.  And Angelo, my good friend.\r\n\r\nSome time I''ll send you the other two movements.  \r\n\r\nFor now, please listen to David Drosinos and the St. Petersburg Symphony play the third movement from my Clarinet Concerto.

How about it?” \r\n\r\n“I know you mean well, but --”\r\n\r\n“Okay.  How about this?  We’ll order a bunch of of bright yellow t-shirts and have ‘em printed up to say, ‘Play Sowash’s Clarinet Concerto.”  Then we’ll get all your friends and fans to wear them while forming a human chain around Music Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Yellow?”\r\n\r\n“Green, then.  Purple.  Fuschia.  Whatever.  Doesn’t matter.  The important thing is:  no one gets in or out of that human chain until the Symphony agrees to —“\r\n\r\n“Oh, brother.”\r\n\r\n“How about a petition drive!  You’d be the first composer ever to do such a thing.  Start right now, here in this restaurant.  Take your napkin around to every table and ask them to sign —“\r\n\r\n“Now, look here.  I’m not going to —”\r\n\r\n“Or just do whatever it is you need to do to win a MacArthur Genius Award or the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Or, better yet, the Legion of Honor.

How much do you suppose they would charge?”\r\n\r\n“$100,000 — at least.”\r\n\r\n“No problem.  How old are you?  65?  Okay, then.  You’ve got ten years before Rick Sowash''s Big 75th Birthday Celebration Concert.  Put aside a mere $10,000 a year and, bingo, you’ll have exactly enough Happy Cabbage to hire the Symphony.”\r\n\r\n“10,000 a year?  Gulp.”\r\n\r\n“Make it your 80th birthday then.  Put aside $6,666 a year.  You shake your head?  Then make it your 90th birthday celebration.  You’ll only have to squirrel away four thousand clams a year.  Again, this head shaking?

Writing vocal music is easy for me, almost effortless.  Fun, too.  The hard part is finding a suitable text. \r\n\r\nWhat makes a text suitable?  Simplicity, sincerity and good vowels. \r\n\r\nSimple?  When sung, English is sometimes difficult to understand.  The words must be simple.  As Winston Churchill said, "Short words are best and the old ones are best of all."  \r\n\r\nSincere?  Another Englishman, Ralph Vaughan Williams, said, "There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers."\r\n\r\nGood vowels?  Ahhh, oooh, uhhh and ohhh.  Diphthongs are nasty to sing.  So is the short "i" as in "which."  Speaking of "which," it''s best to avoid texts with nasty consonant clusters like "wh" and "ch" and "st" and "sp."\r\n\r\nThe text must have something to say.  It doesn''t have to be great, just something.  The lyrics to Schubert''s most famous song, "The Trout," summarized:  "A happy trout swims in a clear brook until he gets caught by a fisherman."  That''s a great song text?  Ah, but what Schubert does with it!  The sunny day, the bubbling stream, the joy of swimming and of youth, your whole life ahead of you, all of that is in the music; the text is merely the vehicle.\r\n\r\nI said that writing songs was almost effortless.  Let me explain.  I didn''t have to invent a tune for Kathryn Jackson''s little poem "Prairie Prayer."  It sang to me as soon as I set eyes upon it.  \r\n\r\nThe words literally instructed me as to how I should construct the melody.  Prairies are level; the opening four words had to repeat the same note so as to be musically level.   Since mountains are higher than prairies and the sky is higher than mountains, the words in the second line obviously demanded an ascending melody.  That''s just common sense.\r\n\r\nThe words "here in the middle am I" must be placed in the singer''s mid-range, half way between the notes assigned to the prairie and those assigned to the sky.  That’s a ‘no-brainer.’\r\n\r\n"Hills crowd down to the river," must be sung to a descending melody, with flowing eighth notes to suggest the river.  Duh.\r\n\r\nThe climax comes when "the sky bursts out with a million stars," so, of course, the word "sky" must be assigned the highest note of the song.  Finally, "nigh unto God am I" must have a reverential feeling, like a benediction.  \r\n\r\nSee how easy it is?  This song wrote itself.  All I had to do was stay out of the way and notate it.\r\n\r\nI think Richard Rodgers felt the same way about Oscar Hammerstein’s lyrics.  He found that the melody was already implicit in the words.  Just stand back and let ‘em sing.\r\n\r\nIf I had an endless supply of texts like “Prairie Prayer,” I could write a song every day.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Dan Hoy sing this little song, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the sheet music, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 20, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),114);

Composers felt justified in turning away from Beethoven.  \r\n\r\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1989, that justification withered.  For my part, I wanted to write some music that would allow me, in my own small way, in my little corner of the world, to welcome back the spirit of Beethoven.  I wondered if I could devise a music that would blend Beethoven-like gestures with the American idioms that are my legacy.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 Barbara Harbach, who had recorded some of my keyboard music, asked me to write a major work she could perform with a flutist friend.\r\n\r\nI decided to try to write a big, strapping, audacious, Beethovenian/American sonata for flute and piano.  \r\n\r\nBeethoven wrote no flute sonatas.  But if he had, you can bet he would have given the flute an heroic role.  The flute is often cast as the sensitive soul, consigned to the playing of lovely, pale gestures, in pastel tones of lavender and magenta.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to do something different.  I wanted to make the flutist swim for her life.  I assigned the flute bold gestures, bright colors and long phrases, requiring the big breaths we take before plunging into water.  \r\n\r\nToday I want to share the first movement of my flute sonata.  The piano offers a gray, tenuous introduction, bleak and shifting, likes sliding chunks of ice.  Patience!  The piece is establishing its vocabulary:  the musical ideas that follow are derived from combinations of the perfect fourths and minor seconds that are announced in this strange introduction.  Then, the heroic flute makes her entrance;  she is poised, strong and noble, an athletic princess, beautiful and confident.  She takes a deep breath, dives and swims, gloriously.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle, “Icy Waters,” didn’t occur to me until I heard the piece performed by the superb pianist Phil Amalong and his sister Barb Sink.  A fine flutist who is also a marathon runner, she has a bold stage presence and gets a big sound out of her instrument.  While she played this music, there came into my mind the image of a swimmer braving icy waters, challenging herself, perhaps rescuing someone.  What I feel when I hear this music is what I would feel if I plunged into cold water -- braced, refreshed, invigorated, intensely alive.\r\n\r\nFew have heard this music.  So far as I know it''s had only four performances and those were for small audiences.  As it has not been professionally recorded on a CD, I have no means of sharing it except by inviting people to listen to this mp3.\r\n\r\nI have dozens of other scores of which the same is true and I am very eager to share them. Some of the pieces, like this one, can hardly be absorbed in a single hearing.  It''s often that way with music that is new to us.  I hope you’ll listen more than once.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to take the plunge and swim hard for thirteen minutes?  Barb and Phil play heroically, like lifeguards in full swing.

Certainly it is richer and more various in tone than when I stood here yesterday.  If I am to watch the splendor of the year mount slowly through all its delicate gradations, I must be vigilant from hour to hour.  \r\n	Early summer’s monotony of green has given place to the tints of maturity; brown and purple, dim orange and umber are faintly discernible along the lower slopes, and there are rare touches of scarlet from the dogwood and sumac in the thicket.  The cedars far and near begin to glow with their peculiar, nameless hue.  Among the solid ranks of the ferns at my feet there is here and there a frond that seems to be made of beaten gold.  \r\n	Winter is a long stern conflict, spring is a brief ecstasy like first love, and autumn is sheer amazement, but late summer brings us peace."\r\n\r\nAh!  Now that is writing I can admire.  I could set those words to music.  Maybe I should.  They already sing.\r\n\r\nI tried to express August in "The Blossom," the second movement of Daweswood, my concertino for violin, clarinet, cello and piano.  I wrote this music in the late summer of 1980 when I was 30 years old and an artist-in-residence at the lovely, thousand-acre Dawes Arboretum in central Ohio.  "Daweswood" was what the Dawes family called the property when it was their private estate, before they left it as the gift to the public.\r\n\r\nI walked all over the Dawes Arboretum during my time there, trying hard to see, deeply, the green and growing things all around me and to devise music that would be worthy of them.  \r\n\r\nThe three movements are titled after the three phases in the life of a plant:  The Bud, the Blossom and the Berry.  "The Bud" is springtime-y and "The Berry" is autumnal, but "The Blossom" is for right now, this August moment, the languid music of fulsome late summer.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (Ken Goldsmith, violin; Terry King, cello, John Jensen, piano) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak play their gorgeous rendition of "The Blossom," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nAugust 17, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),70);

Thinking that Belo-russian audiences might like to hear what an American composer could do with their country''s folksongs, I asked Corinne to send me a selection of some of the better-known ones.\r\n\r\nI gave those folksongs an "American" treatment, intending to offer a metaphor of hope, cooperation and mutual appreciation between former Soviet Union countries and America in the post-Cold War era.  Let us cherish that hope all the more today as relations falter between our country and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe character of the piece is sunny, hopeful, optimistic, even humorous. \r\n\r\nIf you listen carefully to the beginning of this movement, you will recognize the delightful folk-like tune Prokofiev assigned to the Cat in Peter and the Wolf.  (Alright, that tune is not a Belo-Russian folk song; but close enough.)  I gave it an American inflection by changing the meter, adding a pinch of Copland and a dash of the Blues.  The famous tune is only briefly recognizable; it quickly goes in new directions.  \r\n\r\nWhen you hear it you might smile, despite the gloomy news stories.\r\n\r\nThe modified Cat tune is followed by my Americanized version of a rollicking Belo-russian folksong.

I didn’t resist.  Who wants yet another grim and grumpy piece of music?   Since my music was turning out to be sunny, hopeful, even humorous, I titled the suite, “Sunny Days.”  \r\n\r\nThe piece begins with an Introduction:  stern, impressive, mighty and momentous, as if three powerful world leaders are taking their positions behind three podiums on a stage before the United Nations.   Picture them, ‘dressed for success,’ their postures stiff, their faces deeply serious.  They seem poised to announce something sombre, sweeping and grandiose. \r\n\r\nThen comes a surprise.

He is extraordinarily good at what he does, visually conveying the character of the music and stories I want to share.\r\n\r\nWhat''s more, he commissioned me to compose two works to mark two major events in his life.

He is also an ardent protector and appreciator of the beautiful Pigeon River that flows through the north central part of the southern peninsula of Michigan, where he lives.  \r\n\r\nUtilizing, as the film score, the second movement of my “Voyage of the Spirit” (Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano), Gary assembled a lovely piece of video art entitled, “Life of the Forest:  The Pigeon River.”  \r\n\r\nGary really listened to the music.

Sometimes at home I watch DVDs of movies I don''t even like, parts of which positively make me squirm, just so that I can hear, again, a great film score; "The Ten Commandments," "Now, Voyager," and "How The West Was Won," and others.\r\n\r\nI''ve never written a film score, though tracks from my CDs have been featured in several documentaries.  \r\n\r\nOf course, there''s nothing to stop a composer from writing a film score, even without a film. Back in 1979, I did just that.\r\n\r\nWilliam Huggins, a lawyer and amateur violinist in Columbus, OH, commissioned me to write a piece he could perform with friends who played the flute, French horn and harpsichord. Considering the antique sound of the harpsichord and the heroic sound of the horn, I looked to medieval literature for inspiration.  \r\n\r\n"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" is an anonymous masterwork of 14th-century England.  I love this tale and have read it many times.  Not in the original Middle English; only scholars can do that.  I''ve read several translations and for my money the best is J.R.R. Tolkien''s; it''s funny, spooky, mystical.  Reading it, I felt the presence of a master storyteller, wise and wry.\r\n\r\nI thought, "What if there was a film version of this exciting, ambiguous, lovely story?  What would a suitable film score sound like?"  I set to work, devising five movements that could underscore the major scenes of the tale.\r\n	\r\nThe third movement depicts the heroic knight, Sir Gawain, riding merrily through a gloomy, medieval landscape.  It''s entitled "Gawain''s Journey."\r\n\r\nHere''s Tolkien''s rendering of that scene:\r\n\r\nBy a mount in the morning merrily he was riding\r\ninto a forest that was deep and fearsomely wild,\r\nwith high hills at each hand, and hoar woods beneath\r\nof huge aged oaks by the hundred together ....\r\n\r\nSo many a marvel in the mountains he met in those lands\r\nthat ''twould be tedious the tenth part to tell you thereof.\r\nAt whiles with worms he wars, and with wolves also,\r\nat whiles with wood-trolls that wandered in the crags,\r\nand with bulls and with bears and boars, too, at times;\r\nand with ogres that hounded him from the heights of the fells.\r\nHad he not been stalwart and staunch and steadfast in God,\r\nhe doubtless would have died and death had met often.\r\n\r\nBill Huggins and his friends played the piece enthusiastically but it was never performed by anyone else because the combination of instruments was so unusual.  In 2011, I revised and re-scored the piece for piano trio plus trumpet, an ensemble much easier to assemble.\r\n\r\nTo hear Gawain’s Journey performed wit and gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSept. 7, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nCincinnati, the Queen City, has whimsy.  It’s her most lovable trait.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard about Green Man Park, the city’s newest, I bicycled over to the Walnut Hills neighborhood to take a look at it.  An empty lot on McMillan Street has been transformed into a public green space, featuring a seven-foot tall sculpted stone “Green Man."\r\n\r\nDo you know about The Green Man?\r\n\r\nYou’ve seen his face, carved, drawn or painted, fashioned from herbaceous shapes.   Twining vines comprise his hair, beard, eyebrows and mustache.  From a thicket of leafy shrubbery, he peers out at you; his eyes are intense, his expression unreadable.  Is he amused or menacing?  Or both?  Hard to say.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn’t sound familiar, google “Green Man,” select ‘images’ and you’ll see him, quickly enough.  (What times we live in, when it is so easy to do such things!)\r\n\r\nThe carvers who adorned medieval cathedrals routinely rendered depictions of familiar Biblical figures, positioning the likes of Jesus, Joseph, Mary and Moses in lofty niches, plainly visible to the priests and congregations below.  But higher yet, way back in the shadowy rafters, hidden from view, some of them covertly carved images of The Green Man.\r\n\r\nWhy hidden from view?  Because The Green Man was a pagan remnant; he predated Christianity by thousands of years.  The carvers deemed it necessary to include a hidden Green Man in a space that was going to be regarded as sacred for centuries to come.  Knowing the clergy would not approve, the carvers did this work in secret.\r\n\r\nThe Green Man is often understood as a symbol of the cycle of growth, death, decay and rebirth.  That’s plenty to think about ... but there is much more.  \r\n\r\nHe raises questions about our relationship with Nature.  Is Nature, in any sense, a mirror?   When we gaze into a welter of leaves, shrubs and vines, is there, however figuratively, a human face, there in the foliage, gazing back at us?  \r\n\r\nDoes Nature, carefully scrutinized, display any aspects of humanity?   Which?  How?  Why?  \r\n\r\nThe Green Man seems to assert that we humans, too, are part of Nature.  If we believe that, then how shall we order our lives?  How well are we doing?  How healthy is our relationship with Nature?   \r\n\r\nThe Green Man seems poised to address such questions, yet he has no voice; he is only a mute icon after all.  His image, whether carven, drawn, or painted, is wordless and moveless.  Does he have anything to teach us?  Does Nature have anything to teach us?  What?  A warning?  An admonishment?  An inspiration?\r\n\r\nWhy is this figure always male?  Does he give the lie to “Mother Nature?” and “Mother Earth?”\r\n\r\nI have no answers for such questions.  But I love The Green Man.  He prompts us to think!\r\n\r\nThe enormous sculpture newly mounted in Green Man Park was carved by one David Hummel, back in 1890, to ornament a building in Walnut Hills.\r\n\r\nA century later, in 1991, when the building was about to be demolished, the sculpture was rescued by a concerned citizen (who apparently prefers to remain anonymous) and was stored in obscurity for twenty-five years, almost forgotten. \r\n\r\nHow fitting it is that now, at last, comes The Green Man''s resurrection and rebirth as the centerpiece of his own little park, here in our whimsical city.\r\n\r\nThe Green Man appears in literature, too, most notably as the Green Knight in an anonymous literary masterwork of 14th-century England, "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.”  There he is not mute and moveless;  he says and does things!  He speaks forcefully, albeit ambiguously.  His actions are bold but his motives are obscure.  Existing outside the human realm, the Green Knight’s purposes are obscure.  \r\n\r\nI love this poem and have read it many times.  My favorite translation (the original is written in an obscure dialect of ancient English) is the one by J.R.R. Tolkien; it''s funny, spooky, mystical, crafted by a master who knows how to tell a story.  \r\n\r\nIn 1979, I wrote a five-movement suite depicting scenes and characters from the poem, revising and re-scoring it for trumpet, violin, cello and piano in 2011.  \r\n\r\nSir Gawain is the hero of the tale but since the Green Knight dominates the opening and closing scenes, I let him have the final movement all to himself.\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement, entitled “The Green Knight,” performed with heroic gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nAugust 7, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA visitor at the Cincinnati Art Museum seemed almost too interested in our famous Van Gogh.  He was inclining his head almost too close to the precious painting, one of the artist''s very last, and his hands were twitching.\r\n\r\nEver the professional museum guard, dutiful and discreet, I quickly edged closer to him.  Oddly, the painting’s ornate frame seemed to interest him far more than the painting itself.  He raised his fist, curled as if to knock on a door, drawing even nearer this priceless, beautiful artwork.  Too close!\r\n\r\nTaking my cue from Byron’s Assyrian, I “came down like the wolf on the fold,” burbling a forceful “Ahem!” as I drew near.\r\n\r\nHe spun toward me, demanding to know: “May I tap this frame?”  Pantomiming a tapping action in mid-air with his fist, he added, “Like this? Tap! Tap! Tap!”\r\n\r\n“To that,” I replied, firm but friendly, wagging my forefinger, “I must say, “No! No! No!”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, normal after all.  He was a frame-maker, he explained, wondering if the carved wooden frame was solid or veneer and that he could tell by tapping.  I referred him to the Curatorial Department; that was the last I heard of the matter.\r\n\r\nA frame can be a thing of great beauty, complementing the canvas it encases.  Frame-makers are artists (though we’d probably dodge a museum exhibiting only empty frames).\r\n\r\nSome artists make their own frames.  Grant Wood made the frame for his sardonic “Daughters of Revolution,” also on display at the CAM, I’m proud to say.\r\n\r\nComposers are sometimes framer-makers, too.  I’ve devised ‘frames’ for some of my pieces, beginning and ending with music that is separate from, yet complements, the main content of the piece.  \r\n\r\nYou’re invited to listen to an example of this; to wit, the first movement of my suite for violin, trumpet, cello and piano, “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight:  A Christmas Legend.”  The movement has its own title, too:  “Arthur’s Court at Christmas.”  \r\n\r\nThe introduction is a courtly fanfare, a little reminiscent of the unrivaled gem of a fanfare Franz Waxman penned for 20th Century Fox.  My introductory fanfare recurs at the end of the movement … thus, the fanfare serves as both an introduction and an “outro-duction,” to coin a word.  A musical frame, so to speak. One music framing another music.\r\n\r\n(Speaking of intro-ductions vs. outro-ductions, is an Under-ture the opposite of an Overture?  What’s the opposite of an Introit?  A DE-troit?)\r\n\r\nThe fanfare-introduction takes 21 seconds.  Then the piece gets down to business, chortling merrily along, all Christmas-y and quasi-medieval-ly.  At 5:15, the music has said what it has to say.  The “outro-duction” is now sounded, a  25-second modified repeat of the opening fanfare.\r\n\r\nVoilà!  The piece has a frame!\r\n\r\nJust as a well-conceived frame complements a painting, my fanfare grabs attention, establishes a storytelling mood and evokes an ancient and fantastical setting.  It readies us for the entry of noble King Arthur and his splendiferous court and, at the end, bids a fond farewell to the whole kit-and-kaboodle.\r\n\r\nTo hear “Arthur’s Court at Christmas” from my suite “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," performed with heroic gusto by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 18, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAlmost every day, at odd moments, I am visited by troubling memories of moments, some recent, some from long ago, when I have behaved badly, said stupid, hurtful things, missed opportunities to be gracious and kind, falling far short of being the sort of person I want to be, humiliating myself instead.  \r\n\r\nI drive away these futile and soul-devouring regrets as best I can, forcing myself to remember the good things I’ve occasionally managed to get said and done and to appreciate the fact that, if we will allow it, humiliation can lead to wisdom.\r\n\r\nHopefully, we learn, albeit the hard way, not to make that particular mistake again, meanwhile making new ones.  Such experiences remind us that we all fall short, we all betray our ethical standards, however ardently we strive to embrace them.\r\n\r\nThat’s the implied moral of "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," an anonymous 14th-century story-poem from western England.  I love it and have read it many times, though not in the original, written in an arcane dialect of Middle English which only scholars can parse.  I like J.R.R. Tolkien’s translation into plain English; it''s funny, spooky, mystical, wise and wry.  Tolkien knows how to tell a story.\r\n\r\nGawain is the perfect knight.  Even so, he furtively allows a fair lady to gift him with a supposedly magical garment, said to render invincible whoever wears it.  Then he breaks a promise by concealing from the lady''s husband the fact of his having accepted her gift.\r\n\r\nKnowing he will face certain death the next day, Gawain puts his desire to live, to escape death by any means possible, above his code of ethics.  Which of us would not?  \r\n\r\nLater, dramatically confronted with his failure, Gawain is humiliated.  However, from that moment on, he is wise.  He has discovered that no one is perfect, not even himself, the very best knight at Arthur’s Round Table.\r\n\r\nWhen I undertook to write a suite of music depicting various scenes in Sir Gawain’s adventure, I found myself straying far from my usual musical stomping grounds.\r\n\r\nSince you’ve kindly allowed me to send you these messages for a while now, you know quite a lot about my music.  It’s often about the changing seasons, the bucolic landscapes of the American Midwest and other places I’ve visited.  My music is usually cheerful and optimistic, affirming humane values and the sweetness of life, lulling listeners into a roseate trance.  At least that’s how much of it seems to me.\r\n\r\nDevising suitable music for “Sir Gawain” led me to think outside that box.  It’s one thing to write music about wild flowers, dark forests and sunsets, but how can abstractions like Humiliation and Wisdom be ‘music-ified?’  What music could trace a progression from Humiliation to Wisdom?  Questions like that can raise creativity from a simmer to a boil.\r\n\r\nTo hear a beautiful rendering of what I came up with, played with great depth of feeling by violinist Cheryl Trace, trumpeter Thaddeus Archer, cellist Robert Clemens and pianist Greg Kostraba, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 23, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),64);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(34,replace(replace('For everyone who lives in north central Ohio, where I was born and reared and lived my first 44 years, ‘The Lake’ looms large.  \r\n\r\nNot so in Cincinnati.  After moving here in 1994 (so that our two children could attend the city''s celebrated School for the Creative and Performing Arts), I was shocked to find that when I mentioned ‘The Lake,’ people asked me, "What lake?"\r\n\r\nWhat lake?  Were they kidding?  To a northern Ohioan there is only one lake.  ‘The Lake.’  Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nHere in Cincinnati it''s ‘The River.’  The Ohio River.  If Cincinnatians mentioned ‘the river’ and I asked, "What river?" they would think I was kidding.\r\n\r\nSeveral generations of Sowashes passed many happy summers on the shores of Lake Erie, in Lakeside, a Chautauqua resort near Sandusky.  For a while, our family even had a cottage there and a small sailboat in which I ventured to Kelly''s Island and elsewhere, exploring the waters where Oliver Hazard Perry defeated the British Navy at the Battle of Lake Erie.  To this day, northern Ohioans take pride in that victory, which proved a much-needed morale-booster for our side in the War of 1812. \r\n\r\nOnce, strange to tell, on a very windy day, sailing with my ten-year-old nephew, our little craft floundered.  Despite a hard-blowing wind, we were just bobbing around, not going anywhere. How could that be?  \r\n\r\nI looked around.   Was there something wrong with the rudder?  the keel?  No.  Looking up, I discovered the problem:  the sail had come loose from the top of the mast.  I could not climb the mast to repair it.  We were a long way from shore.  There was only one thing to do.  \r\n\r\nWe slid into the water and dog-paddled, buoyed by our life-jackets, tugging behind us a rope attached to the sailboat.  At length we landed on one of the many tiny, unnamed islands in the waters rendered glorious by O.H. Perry.  We beached our boat, shipwrecked on a desert island!  We tipped the boat on its side and used our shoelaces to fasten the sail back onto the mast and then sailed back to Lakeside in triumph, with a story to tell!  My nephew was beaming with joy!  He''d had a real adventure!\r\n\r\nEven now and then, here in Cincinnati, in this humid valley carved by ‘The River’ so long ago, I step outside to find that the wind is brisk and fast, the air dry and clear.  Yesterday morning was like that, a clear September day.  At such moments, though we''ve lived in the Queen City for twenty years, though I''ve not set foot in a sailboat in all that time, I always think, "Ah!  A perfect day for sailing!"\r\n\r\nThat''s the subtitle I gave to the third movement of Anecdotes and Reflections (1989), my concertino for violin, clarinet, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nTo hear "A Perfect Day for Sailing" played by clarinetist Craig Olzenak with the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSept. 21, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIt’s the weekend of the Glorious Fourth.  Marches by the incomparable John Philip Sousa will be heard in parades, concerts and broadcasts across America.\r\n\r\nSousa truly is The March King, the unrivaled master of his genre.  For the sheer zest of his tunes, for his ability to start toes tapping, for his knack of inducing crowds to hysterical cheering, for the images that leap to mind whenever his music is heard — flags waving, athletes, candidates, confetti — let us give thanks for and pay homage to John Philip Sousa.\r\n\r\nMy own tribute to Sousa is the sixth and final movement of my longest work:  Anecdotes and Reflections.  It’s my attempt at a portrait of America, celebrating our exuberance, our energy, our sense of ourselves as the great Melting Pot, our tradition of tolerance and our capacity to embrace and rejoice in our diversity.\r\n\r\n(I am not blind to our problems;  there is much to deplore.  One way of responding to Evil is to celebrate what is good.)\r\n\r\nThis music was composed in 1989, commissioned by Chamber Music in Yellow Springs, Inc., of Yellow Springs, Ohio, in memory of a founder of the organization, Louise Betcher.  \r\n\r\nMy Sousa tribute ends with a tune borrowed from the Master''s great “Liberty Bell March.”  Sousa’s tune is given a twist or two, but you may recognize it.  (Composers are allowed to borrow from one another, did you know?)\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak''s exuberant rendition of the final movement from “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 5, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA young composer sent me an mp3 recording and a PDF of the score of a piece he had written, asking my opinion of the music.  \r\n\r\nI dislike the role of a judge.  As if music is a contest and I’m somehow qualified to separate the winners from the losers.  I hate contests that pretend to have the ability to judge creativity, a thing which cannot even be measured let alone presented Gold, Silver or Bronze medals.\r\n\r\nI admire what Charles Ives said when informed that he had won the Pulitzer Prize for Music:  “Prizes are for boys,” he said.  "I’m grown up."\r\n\r\nContrariwise, I’m very glad to share with composers what I have figured out about the career aspects of the craft.  I have a lot to offer in response to queries such as, “How do I get my music performed?  How can I get my music recorded and broadcast on classical music radio stations?  Shall I publish my own scores or try to find a ‘real’ publisher?  Shall I produce my own CDs or try to find a ‘real’ record label?”  \r\n\r\nBut I dislike being asked to pronounce upon the quality of the music itself.  Who am I to judge someone’s music?  Who is anyone?  Each of us is ‘just another listener.''\r\n\r\nStill, I don’t want to be churlish.  I admire the young composer having the pluck to ask me.  When I was young, a wise man once imparted to me a simple truth:  “If you don’t ask questions, you don’t get answers.”  \r\n\r\nI’ve asked a lot of questions and I am grateful to those who offered some answers.  \r\n\r\nThat’s why, with a heavy sigh and a burdensome sense of obligation, I clicked on the mp3 the composer had sent me and listened.\r\n\r\nMarvelous, right off the bat!  Light, crisp and as fresh as if it was just back from the cleaners!  Syncopated, lively, delightful!  \r\n\r\nI kept listening.  More light, crisp, fresh music.  More lively syncopations.  Then yet more.  After that, more.  When that was over, more.  Ugh.\r\n\r\nThere was never a hint of contrast.  The piece was stuck in a light, crisp, fresh little world that soon lost my interest.  I stuck it out to the end but my initial delight dwindled into tedium because the music never found its shadow, never acknowledged its opposite, its dark twin.   Thus, it developed into wisdom.  That’s an allusion to something Robert Frost said, that a poem should “begin in delight and end in wisdom.”  That goes for music, too.\r\n\r\nOf course, I sent an encouraging reply to the young composer.  I told him the truth: that I’d found the music to be light, crisp, fresh, lively, delightful.  But that’s all I told him.  I let it go at that.  I didn''t want to be a jerk.\r\n\r\nHere’s the thing.  Any piece of music must begin in a certain place and then either 1) go someplace else and eventually return or 2) stop pretty soon and be followed by music in a different mood, key, tempo, i.e., a contrasting movement or section which must, in turn, either go someplace else and return or stop and be followed by yet another different mood, key, tempo, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen music begins in a certain place and then goes someplace else, well, the interesting question is how FAR away will it go from where it started?  Is there a limit?  If a composer goes TOO far away from where he started, will listeners think he’s schizophrenic?  Is there some way to link two extremely disparate musics so that they remain true to the soul of the composer holding the figurative pen in hand as the work was coming into being?\r\n\r\nIf I were a little bolder, I’d have asked that young composer to do what I am asking YOU to do now … to listen to the fifth movement of my “Anecdotes & Reflections" for violin, clarinet, cello and piano.  This piece “goes someplace else,” that’s for sure.  No other movement in all my 400 works contains such extremely opposite musics as this one.\r\n\r\nPlease, let me walk you through it.  If you want to listen WHILE you are reading the following, click on the link above.\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/anec_ref.5.mp3\r\n\r\nIt begins and ends with a ten-second “frame.”  Like a painting, the music is bordered, defined, enclosed by its frame.\r\n\r\nAt second eleven (0:11) the tune commences and you immediately know that you are, musically, in a particular spot.  The piano, all by itself, plays a slow, wistful, mysterious dance music, repeating it fully four times, joined first by the violin, then by the violin AND the cello, finally by the violin, the cello AND the clarinet.  \r\n\r\nSo far the music, though very beautiful, seems to be ’stuck’ in that place.  Hopefully, it is so beautiful that you don’t mind lingering.  Patience!  \r\n\r\nSure enough, at precisely 3:32 we hear “the frame” again, the one that commenced the movement.\r\n\r\nBut at 3:53 something different begins!  A different key, meter, mood … \r\n\r\nFor some reason, this music has always made me think of Christmas, especially when it gets to 4:53.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of “going someplace else.”  One is the “wrong note.”\r\n\r\nListen carefully at 5:21 for the very long, very high “wrong note” in the violin.  It persists for so long that it finally becomes the “right note” after all!\r\n\r\nThe “Christmas” section begins to wind down at 6:21 with a calm, repetitive figure\r\n\r\nSuddenly! at 6:59 the “Christmas” tune is utterly transformed into, of all things, an old-time, jazzy tune, reminiscent of Benny Goodman, Djano Rinehart, Duke Ellington.  Musically, we’ve reached the extreme opposite of where the movement started.\r\n\r\nThe jazzy section concludes beginning at 9:04 with a feeling of “One mo’ time, folks!”  I picture a vaudeville performer singing, dancing, grimacing and waving his straw boater hat at the audience.\r\n\r\nA quick transformation follows … we’re back to “Christmas” music in its original form, but now in a minor key … \r\n\r\nThen the “frame” is heard again and at 9:47, the music returns to the sad and stately dance we heard at the beginng … but this time with the jazzy tune,modified, calmed down, heard in the clarinet.  \r\n\r\nAt the end, the two disparate musics embrace.  The reconciliation of opposites has been achieved.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the “frame,” heard at 10:34, to bring closure.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak''s alternately sensitive and exuberant rendition of the fifth movement from “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above. \r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThere were about a hundred friends and fans on my list of recipients for these weekly emails when I began sending them, almost four years ago.  Y’all sometimes forwarded them to your friends, many of whom subsequently signed up, swelling the number of recipients to 600 plus.\r\n\r\nThough replies are not expected, I’m pleased when some of you occasionally respond with your thoughts and I always reply in turn.  \r\n\r\nOne friend recently responded with this observation:\r\n\r\n	<< I have noticed something (and I''m sure I''m not the only one) consistent in your music, almost like a signature.  It''s that four-note descending figure, most prominent I think in your "Anecdotes & Reflections."  How did it come to you, and why is it so prevalent in your works?\r\n	I have played a small handful of your pieces, listened to dozens more, and could probably at this point pick your music out of a crowd by style alone. But that four-note motif would seal the deal instantly if I was at all unsure. >>\r\n\r\nHe’s right.  There IS a certain four-note shape that has inspired a great deal of my music. \r\n\r\nIf I could sit down with you at a piano and take you inside that shape by playing it for you, I’m pretty sure you’d find enthrallment was in store.\r\n\r\nDo you recall, when you were little, holding a glass marble very close to your eye and then tilting your head toward the sky to view the brightly illumined universe inside?  I remember one particular marble -- a "boulder" as we used to call the big ones -- it was a rich indigo blue, marbleized with creamy-white stripes.  I was amazed to look inside; it seemed to open up infinitely.  When I see photos of galaxies and nebulae I feel again what I felt when I peered inside that marble.\r\n\r\nSigh.  I wonder if any American kids still play with marbles.  \r\n\r\nWell, for me this little four-note musical shape has been like that marble.  When I peered ''inside'' it, an immense range of possibilities opened.  Even though I explored it for about twenty-five years, there are vast reaches still waiting to be discovered.  It pops up in almost all of the works I''ve written in the second half of my career.\r\n\r\nOne of the many meanings it has for me is something like a signature, as when a painter signs a painting.  It’s like that squiggle of red letters down in the right hand corner, “Monet.”  The little shape functions exactly thus at the very end of both of the "Two Self-Portraits" that comprise my Trio #8 for clarinet, cello and piano.  It''s my way of inserting an autograph into the very body of the music.  \r\n\r\nThe little shape is autobiographical, a musical genome.  At a piano, I could show you how the sound of the shape is, at once, French and American, an indication of my genealogical and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThe shape can be indicated as these notes, descending:    A - G - E - E flat (or D sharp, ''same diff'').   \r\n\r\nPlayed forwards, backwards, right-side-up or upside-down, it is mysterious, sensual, blues-y.  It is imbued with tension because it yearns with equal passion to move in opposite directions on the circle of fifths.  In the example I gave above, it seems to indicate an A7 chord with a flatted fifth, which wants to drop to a D in the circle of fifths.  But the E flat belies that, seeming to indicate a E flat 7 chord with a flatted fifth, pointing in the opposite direction, up to an A flat.\r\n\r\nIt seems alive to me, human, because — have you noticed? — we humans also yearn with equal passion to move in opposite directions.  \r\n\r\nThe first three notes are pentatonic, expressing certitude, purity, simplicity, but the fourth note introduces the ambiguous tri-tone, expressing doubt.  The first three notes are lulling and cozy; the fourth note is the ‘wrong’ note, chromatic, sensual, jazzy, sinister, comical, problematic; its trajectory is aimed “outside the box.”  The first three notes offer three cheers for the faithful husband, solid and dependable if a bit stodgy; the fourth note turns his head; he is not incognizant of the mezzo’s dimples, hazel eyes and long, chestnut hair.\r\n\r\nThe fourth note is like a thimbleful of grenadine dropped into a beaker of clear water — clear, sterile and colorless — clear, that is, until tinged, clouded and infused by the spreading, smoky thimbleful.\r\n\r\nWhen I played or sang that four-note shape, employing as the opening note each degree of a major or minor scale, melodies gushed forth.  It was as if, hiking, thirsty and hot, I had discovered a cool spring on a mountain side.\r\n\r\nThe shape was particularly helpful at pivotal moments, the “seams” that separate the tunes and sections of a piece of music.  When I felt I’d lingered almost too long in one tonality, the shape was always there, a catalyst, ready to bounce the music into another tonality, new and fresh.\r\n\r\nWhere did it come from?  It’s the first four notes of a descending “Blues” scale, which gives it a jazzy sound.  But that’s not where I found it.  Years ago, I attended a conference of choral composers organized by Gregg Smith, director of the celebrated Gregg Smith Singers.  One of the pieces by another of the composers at the conference began with this intriguing four-note shape.  I heard it once and the seed was planted.  I recall the names of neither the piece, nor the composer, though I remember that I didn’t like the piece because it scarcely sampled the enormous potential I heard in those notes.  \r\n\r\nYears later a friend pointed out that the same four-note shape occurs, just once, in the “Two Pictures” by Bartok.  I listened and, sure enough, there it is.  But I had been exploring the potentialities of the shape for about fifteen years by then and had never heard the Bartok piece.  I did not borrow it from Bartok.\r\n\r\nThis shape came to me at precisely the right time in my life.  In my twenties and early thirties, I had achieved a vibrant, pastoral style, evocative of the Ohio countryside and the quiet village life I’d known.  Increasingly, that style had come to seem less honest to me.  I felt I was plagiarizing myself, writing “the sort of music Rick Sowash would write” rather than writing music that truly expressed my experience.  \r\n\r\nBut when I tried to force alien, non-pastoral elements into my music, such as diminished seventh chords or weird modes, the result was phonus bolonus.  I longed to deepen the pastoral style, to find a door through it rather than abandoning it altogether.\r\n\r\nThat 4-note shape proved to be the mysterious little door I sought.  \r\n\r\nAt 41 minutes, “Anecdotes & Reflections” is my longest work and an extended exploration of that four-note shape.  Today I invite you to listen to the first movement.  It begins with a repeated “A” thumping energetically in the piano.  The clarinet enters playing -- you guessed ‘er, Chester! —  the first statement of the four-note shape, the first of hundreds that will recur throughout the six movements of the work.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King and pianist John Jensen) and clarinetist Craig Olzenak''s exuberant rendition of the first movement of “Anecdotes and Reflections,” click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),68);

One was a chronicle of China''s 5,000 years squeezed into a book of manageable length; I figured it would require six or seven hours to read.\r\n\r\nThe other, Stephen Mitchell''s translation of Lao Tzu''s Tao Te Ching, one of the world''s great scriptures, the fundamental, indispensable classic of Chinese thought, is only 5,000 words long. I flipped through it for a few seconds.  It offers 81 terse thoughts.  All short, some very.  I thought I''d give it a half an hour or so and then turn to the history book.\r\n\r\nWas I wrong!  Hours passed and I was only half-way through the Tao Te Ching.\r\n\r\nDuring those 17 hours in flight, I did manage to read both books.  I passed about six hours reading the book of Chinese history, as anticipated.  But I must have passed twice as much time reading the Tao Te Ching.  \r\n\r\nOr not reading, exactly.  Pondering would be a better word.  Each of the 81 thoughts compels thinking -- long, deep, careful thinking.  I read one and found myself gazing out the window, thinking hard about it for twenty minutes before turning to the next.  \r\n\r\nThis ambiguous little book, written 600 years before Jesus, seemed to address the most pressing particulars of my life at that time; in all the years since, it has often helped me to think about whatever is going on in my life, in my family, in our country or in the world.\r\n\r\nI kept a slim copy in my pocket when I was working as a security guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum.

I especially loved to peruse it when I was guarding the Asian galleries.  \r\n\r\nHere are a few of the many lines I''ve pondered, long and hard:\r\n\r\nHe who has power over others\r\ncan''t empower himself.     (Oh?  Why is that?)\r\n\r\nIf you realize that you have enough,\r\nyou are truly rich.     (Ah, but how much is enough?  how rich is truly rich?)\r\n\r\nThe more he [the Master] gives to others,\r\nthe wealthier he is.     (wealthier in what sense?)\r\n\r\nSuccess or failure: which is more dangerous?     (what dangers come to mind?)\r\n\r\nGive evil nothing to oppose\r\nand it will disappear by itself.     (what about Hitler?  Stalin? would Gandhi agree?)\r\n\r\nCare about people''s approval\r\nand you will be their prisoner.     (how exactly?  what about approval of family, friends?)\r\n\r\nDo your work.  Then step back.\r\nThe only path to serenity.     (a day''s work?  a life''s work?  why is it the only path?)\r\n\r\nInevitably, I started setting to music thoughts from the Tao Te Ching.  One of these was #12. Here it is:  \r\n\r\nColors blind the eye.\r\nSounds deafen the ear.\r\nFlavors numb the taste.\r\nThoughts weaken the mind.\r\nDesires wither the heart.\r\n\r\nThe Master observes the world\r\nbut trusts his inner vision.\r\nHe allows things to come and go.\r\nHis heart is open as the sky.\r\n\r\nOne can think for a long, long time about these words.  Is it a caution against hedonism?  Are we being warned not to be led and shaped only by our senses, thoughts, desires?  We’re told to trust our inner vision, to let things come and go and become as open as the sky.  What does this mean, practically?\r\n\r\nBut look again!  We''re not told to do anything.  We''re simply told what the Master does and that the Master''s heart is open.  Are we to do likewise?  Do we want to be a Master?  A Master of what, exactly?  Hearts open to what, precisely?  \r\n\r\nThink!  Think!  Think!  \r\n\r\nSee what I mean?\r\n\r\nI''d love to share much more about this remarkable little book ... it offers profound advice for artists ... it offers counsel about governance of self, family, nation ... it explores the idea of ''action through non-action'' ... it speaks about personal finances ... it offers glimpses into mystical experience ... and there is humor in the book as well! ... but I’ve already gone on too long.

My music came to me for free, after all;  at last I’ve found a way to share it for free.  \r\n\r\nToday, I’m passing out free French Toast.  That''s the name of the second movement of my suite entitled, A Little Breakfast Music .  I wrote this music in 1976 for two couples, friends who played oboe, clarinet and violin.  I wanted to give my friends some music the four of them could play together; there is no repertoire for that combination of instruments.  The absence of a bass instrument and the subject of breakfast called for a light, supple music.  Music that is sprightly, nimble, delightful.\r\n\r\nFrench Toast is not French (in France, they call it pain perdu which means “lost bread,” i.e., stale bread, because French toast is always better if the bread you’re using is stale). but including that entrée in this suite gave me an excuse to write music that would sound French, music influenced by those charming French composers:  Ibert, Francaix and Poulenc.\r\n\r\nThe influence is legitimate because I am the descendent of French immigrants.  My French Huguenot ancestors arrived in Boston in 1737.  Paul Revere and Davy Crockett were also descended from Huguenots.  Good company!  \r\n\r\nThat was a long time ago, but I love to think that, in my heart, I remain a Frenchman.  It''s one of my folies.  \r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement, "French Toast," from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 5, 2014\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIn 1976, not long out of Music School, I wrote a suite for four friends who played treble clef instruments — an oboist, a clarinetist and two violinists.  With no bass instrument, the content of the piece had to be light-weight.  Usually “light classical” is the term applied to comic operettas, but this is a chamber work, entitled A Little Breakfast Music. Each of the five movements depicts an item we’d be likely to eat for breakfast.\r\n\r\nYou’re invited to partake of the last movement:  “Honey on English Muffins.”  Duration:  7 minutes, 22 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe movement opens in  4/4  with the sweetest, syrupy-est tune I could conceive, fashioned entirely from rising sixths.  That’s the “Honey” music, a ‘honey’ of a tune.   \r\n\r\nNext come the English muffins.  At 1:55 the meter changes to 6/8 and the musical style turns English.  We hear a country jig in the manner of Ralph Vaughan Williams (a British composer whose work I admire).\r\n\r\nThe music jigs happily along, moving in and out of various keys, major and minor.\r\n\r\nThen, at 6:30 the “Honey” music returns and is heard simultaneously with the English jig.  Both tunes are sounded at once as the honey is poured onto the muffin.\r\n\r\nVoilà!  Enjoy!\r\n\r\nI love this piece for its tunefulness and because it expresses the exuberance of a 26-year-old composer, free at last from the constraints of Academe, writing what he likes, with no professors or fellow composition students looking over his shoulder.  He has found his authentic voice and is having a blast, discovering what all he has to say.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Honey on English Muffins” from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook (recorded on my CD A Portrait at 50), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJan. 10, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nYears ago, on NPR, I heard a scientist say, "Half the battle is asking the right question."\r\n\r\nIt''s also true of creative work.  When artists ask themselves intriguing questions, creative ideas come a-tumbling.\r\n\r\nMozart''s most famous string piece is Eine Kleine Nachtmuzik -- A Little Night Music.  I asked myself, What about music for the next morning?  What would that be?  Eine Kleine Frühstück Muzik? -- A Little Breakfast Music?  What instruments and what tunes would express that?\r\n\r\nI thought about what I like to eat for breakfast and asked myself how these items could be depicted.  \r\n\r\nWhat about orange juice?  \r\n\r\nWe don''t drink much O.J.; just a little glass, please; the movement must be short.  Duration: 1:42.\r\n\r\nOrange juice is a pick-me-up, an eye-opener; the tune must be a bugle-call, a RISING tune; it must say, "Wake up!"\r\n\r\nOrange juice is brightly colored; the piece must be in a sharp key, played by treble  instruments, no lumbering basses, cellos or bassoons; I scored it for oboe, clarinet and two violins.  \r\n\r\nIt must be a bit sour, a bit dissonant, but pleasing, the way orange juice is.\r\n\r\nIt must sound like morning; it must have that fresh, sunny, American sound we hear in Copland''s best-loved pieces.\r\n\r\nTo hear Orange Juice, the opening movement of "A Little Breakfast Music," played by oboist Robert Franz,  clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook (recorded on my CD "A Portrait at 50"), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH   \r\nDecember, 2013\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI am, to the bone, an Ohioan.  And an amateur Ohio-ologist.\r\n\r\nAwhile back, in one of my Sunday morning emails, I began with this:\r\n\r\n“When a presidential candidate said, “Ohio is an amazing state!” I thought:  “The claims are true; this candidate really is a liar.  I know a thing or two about the Buckeye state and the only thing here that amazes me is Serpent Mound.”\r\n\r\nA friend and fan who enjoys these emails replied to remind me of Ohio’s great public library system, asserting:  “Ohio is the only state that supports local libraries and thus any Ohioan can patronize any local public library.”  She is right.  Ohio’s public library system is amazing; Cincinnati’s has the highest circulation rate in North America; I live just six blocks from the Main Library, an amazing resource.  When I became friends with the former children’s book editor of the NY Times, she told me, “Ohio’s public library system is the envy of the nation."\r\n\r\nAnother wrote, “Ohio cannot be Hawaii.  ‘Amazing'' can take various forms.  Wendell Berry wrote an essay in which he cautions against the emphasis on ''showpiece'' parks and natural sites, addressing the danger of overlooking the humble beauty around us, when we only preserve places that are so obviously glorious."\r\n\r\nWell said and true enough.  Wendell Berry is what the Japanese call “a living national treasure.”  Who am I to gainsay a great soul?\r\n\r\nStill, the candidate was lying.  The pronouncement that ”Ohio is amazing” was not about humble beauty, public libraries or Serpent Mound.  It was pandering.\r\n\r\nThe reasons I differ with the candidate’s assertion don’t arise from a comparison of Ohio’s scenery with that of other states.  Nor am I forgetting the truly amazing achievements of certain Ohioans, such as Wilbur and Orville Wright.  \r\n\r\nI am thinking chiefly of Ohio’s attitude toward new ideas.\r\n\r\nTake for example, the idea of raising of the minimum wage in Ohio so that service industry workers could earn an income just above the poverty level.  This issue speaks to me.  Last Fall I left my part-time position as an ‘art guard'' at the Cincinnati Art Museum.  Eight years earlier, I began at the minimum wage.  By the time I left, incremental raises had lifted my pay to $8.25 per hour.  \r\n\r\nFor me, working as a museum guard was a gentleman’s pastime.  But some of my fellow guards were trying to earn a living from that job alone.  Ironic, that “the working poor” should be engaged to protect paintings, sculptures and objets d’art worth billions.\r\n\r\nYou must have heard:  some cities and states have raised the minimum wage to $15.   Ohio would never be the first to experiment with anything so ‘amazing’ as that.  Our governor, despite commendably articulating a Christian concern for the poor (sparking immediate criticism from his fellow party members), strongly opposes raising the minimum wage, as does the majority party in both houses of our legislature.  They say it would be ''bad for business.’  \r\n\r\nHow about a penny tax on bottles of sugar-sweetened beverages?  Fine for folks in Berkley, California if that’s how they want to try to reduce the rate of obesity.  (Psst!  It’s working.)\r\n\r\nA nickel deposit on glass bottles?  \r\n\r\nHigh speed rail connecting Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland?  \r\n\r\nA Johnny Appleseed National Monument?\r\n\r\nRoadways paved with solar cells?\r\n\r\nThe town of Fitzgerald, GA planted pecan trees in every yard.  After a few years, instead of paying a city tax, the citizens simply gathered the pecans and turned them over to the city, which sold them to pecan buyers, thus funding the city government.  The residents of Fitzgerald paid zero city taxes.  Pecan trees won''t thrive in Ohio’s climate, true.  So … walnut trees?   Good idea?  I don’t know.  Just sayin’ ...\r\n\r\nSome cities plant hardwood ‘shade trees’ along the streets.  How about planting apple trees, providing free apples to anyone who wants to pluck them from the branches or gather them up from the ground?   Good idea?  I don’t suppose Ohio’s apple orchard industry would think so.  Understandable.\r\n\r\nNot all new ideas are good ideas.  Still, can we be open to new ideas?  How about considering twenty new ideas and then choosing the best one?\r\n\r\nOh, me-oh-my-oh.  Not in Ohio.\r\n\r\nOhio is wary of new-fangled notions.  ’Twas ever thus.  Mark Twain observed, “If the world should come to an end, I’d want to be in Cincinnati because everything happens there ten years after it happens everywhere else.”\r\n\r\nOnly when about two-thirds of the other states have succeeded in doing something new, only then will Ohio begin to consider it.  Buckeyes have an unwritten policy opposing anything that might just maybe seem edgy to somebody somewhere, no matter how enthusiastically others might favor it.  \r\n\r\nEven when we do achieve something great, it’s in the face of fervid opposition.  Last week Cincinnati  inaugurated its new 3.6 mile electric streetcar system, connecting two parts of the historic downtown.  The proposal was passionately decried and fiercely opposed, from the start.  The citizenry launched multiple petition drives against it.  Our current mayor proudly campaigned as the proposals''s most vociferous opponent.  Our current governor’s transportation panel stripped $52 million of federal funds which had been made available for the project and which would have extended the streetcar’s route so as to connect the downtown to the University district.  The governor takes a dim view of public transit.  \r\n\r\nCincinnati’s new streetcar squeaked into existence by the skin of its teeth, within hours of a deadline to qualify for the remaining federal funds.  \r\n\r\nYet other cities such as Portland, San Francisco and New Orleans, have long been famous for their streetcars.  (Note that all three are coastal cities.)  \r\n\r\nStreetcars are not a new idea, not even here.  Cincinnati had an electric streetcar system for 62 years (1889-1951) without collapsing into fiscal or cultural chaos.  And this new one is so modest.  Just 3.6 miles.  In 2002, a 60-mile system was proposed that would have connected nearly all of the city’s 52 neighborhoods, costing a mere half-cent hike in the local sales tax.  Cincinnati voted it down, with a whopping 68% opposed.  Why would such an obviously good idea face such an uphill struggle for acceptance here in Middle-America, here in Ohio?\r\n\r\nWhen I was a county commissioner in northern Ohio I strongly supported the conversion of an unused railroad track into a bike trail that would connect the municipalities of Bellville, Lexington and Mansfield.  The opposition was immediate and furious.  At public hearings, people whose sons had been in my Scout troop, screamed in my face.  A bike trail, they said, would bring trespassers, drugs, burglary and rape. Cyclists would poop on their lawns; property values would plummet.  Plus, paradoxically, they were certain that NO-body would EVER use it.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of a vicious campaign against it, which included heavy-handed vandalism, like bulldozing piles of dirt over the proposed path, it passed by a hair.  Mind, this was WELL AFTER rail-to-trail bike paths had popped up all over the country.  Today, thirty years later, back in Mansfield, everyone loves ‘the bike trail’ and hundreds use it every day.\r\n\r\nThese stories are typical of Ohio.  We say, “What?  Be an innovator?  Foster an “amazing” new idea?  No thank you.  Let the coasts innovate, if it suits their fancy.  We know who we are and where we are:  we’re in the middle, the center.  Maybe, just maybe, after a long time, after a great many others have done it, then Ohio might — mind you, might — think about giving it a try.”\r\n\r\nWhy does Ohio have this attitude?  It began when Ohio was the Wild West.  Ohio''s pioneers were a confluence of two disparate cultures:  Connecticut Yankees and Virginians.  The New Englanders viewed the Virginians as shiftless and lazy.  The Virginians viewed the Yankees as grasping and Puritanical.  But the hardships of the frontier forced them to look past their prejudices and get along.  They managed it and in the process they devised a new kind of American:  the Midwesterner.  \r\n\r\nNeither New England-ish nor Southern, Ohio remains determinedly centrist to this day. Midwesterners are famously friendly, but wary of new ideas. \r\n\r\nPolitically, this makes Ohio the preeminent ''battleground state.''  Oddly enough, precisely because Ohio is the most typical, ordinary, middle-of-the-road, centrist state, Ohioans, though they constitute only about 3% of the total population of this country, usually decide who will be president.  That’s sort of amazing, I have to admit.\r\n\r\nWe split very nearly 50/50 on every candidate, every issue, every idea.  We balance urban and rural, 50/50.  With more cities boasting populations in excess of 50,000 than any other state, we retain a rural character; Ohio is thought of as a ''farm state.’   When Ohio tilts a tidge to the Right or a smidgeon to the Left, so goes the Nation.  \r\n\r\nPlease don’t get me wrong.  Ohio suits me just fine.  As a speaker-for-hire, a presenter in schools, a writer and publisher of books about the state, and, yes, as a composer, I’ve had thousands of opportunities right here in Ohio.  I’d not be churlish.  I’m grateful and I’ve expressed my gratitude in various small ways, by trying to make my state a better place.\r\n\r\nI see my life’s work, which you kindly allow me to share in these emails, as a completely characteristic product of Ohio.  The music I’ve composed -- every note, phrase and chord  — is, for better or worse, Ohio-ish.  It offers nothing innovative or experimental, nothing “amazing."  It simply extends existing musical traditions in pleasant, comfortable, respectful ways.  \r\n\r\nI was never an avant garde composer, never wanted to be.  Call me a composer of the “derrièrre garde.”  Call me an Ohioan.\r\n\r\nMine is the music you would expect to have been composed by a middle-class guy who grew up in the 1950’s, in Mansfield, Ohio, a rural county seat, a town, not quite a city.   A Boy Scout who earned his Eagle badge (fifty years ago this month) and later served as a Scoutmaster.  Married to my high school sweetheart for 44 years, I’ve been a faithful husband, a loving father and a law-abiding citizen.  I have voted in every election, served on a jury and even held public office for a single term.  I eschew vulgarity and deplore profanity.  I’m an every-Sunday church-goer at a Presbyterian church where I am a Deacon and a tenor in the choir.  I organize and chair the church’s annual Shrove Tuesday Pancake Supper.  In short, I’m reliable, a fellow who keeps his word and pays his bills on time.\r\n\r\nMy music is well-crafted, occasionally funny, sometimes moving.  No one is amazed by it.  \r\n\r\nAmazing?  Debussy’s “La Mer,” Sibelius’ Fifth Symphony, Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,” Charles Ives’ “The Unanswered Question,” George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” …  those works amaze.\r\n\r\nMe?  I’ve turned out good, solid, Ohio stuff.  I’ve made people smile.\r\n\r\nAin’t nothin’ wrong with that!\r\n\r\nHere’s an example.  I’m inviting you to listen to "Eggs & Bacon,” the third movement from A Little Breakfast Music played by oboist Robert Franz, clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook.  (Note the obvious:  eggs and bacon do not amaze, but they sure are good!)  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSeptember 18, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\nChina!   Tea.  Rice.  Right?  You’d think so, but … well ...\r\n\r\nMore precisely, Taiwan!  The furthest away from home I’d ever been.  \r\n\r\nI shepherded three cultural exchange tour groups from Richland County, Ohio, my native stomping grounds, to Taiwan and back. I had gotten myself elected County Commissioner in 1986.  Our county had a sister-county relationship with Taipei, Taiwan.  The other commissioners, one a mid-level United Telephone executive, the other a Dairy farmer, had no interest in our relationship with the Republic of China.  So it fell to me.  I made the most of it.  \r\n\r\nAfter Nixon’s 1972 visit to mainland China, the USA severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  To this day we have no embassy there, though Taiwan remains our fifth-largest trading partner.  \r\n\r\nThus, I, of all people, a composer who had stumbled into politics, found myself the highest-ranking American office-holder to visit the island in the seventeen years since Nixon had reversed our China policy.  I got the red carpet treatment.  The Governor of Taiwan greeted me in his office.  I even met Lee Teng-hui, the President of the Republic of China, marking the only time I ever chewed the fat with a seated Head of State.  \r\n\r\nThey didn’t seem to realize that a County Commissioner has no sway in the formulation of international policy.  Maybe they knew but were too polite to let on.  Maybe they thought my political star was rising and that I might someday become an American Grand Pooh Bah.  If so, they were mistaken.  I served only one term and never ran for office again.  (Aside from visits to Taiwan, my tenure as a County Commissioner wasn’t much fun.)\r\n\r\nChinese don’t shake hands.  They bow and serve tea.  A dozen times a day, promenaded in parks, museums, schools, universities, governmental agencies, I was presented with  tiny cups of delicious tea, piping hot.  I drank it politely, toasting my host — the director, principal or bureaucrat-in-chief, as the case may be -- as he toasted me.  \r\nBut when I wanted a cup of tea in a restaurant I could never get one.  Instead, my hosts insisted that I drink fine wine during the meal and cognac afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with rice.  The food was fabulous, vivid, piquant, colorful, imaginative, brilliant.  Beyond describing.  Each of the multiple courses was so flavorful that it begged for the palliative contrast of a nice pile of delicious, steaming rice alongside.  Yet, rice was not to be had.\r\n\r\nI could not understand this.  What is Chinese cuisine, anyway?  Great Stuff + Rice.  That’s the equation.  Right?  Everyone knows that.  But all I got was the Great Stuff.  Never a grain of rice.\r\n\r\nFinally, I pressed the issue, just a little.  I politely insisted.  I figured it would be easy.  We were in a Chinese restaurant, for Pete’s sake, so they just HAD to have a pot of rice on the stove, back in the kitchen.  All they had to do was bring me a bowl of it.\r\n\r\nWhen my interpreter explained my request to the waiter, the fellow gave me a quick, odd look, then smiled, nodded and left.  I thought he’d be back in a jiffy with my rice but when he returned a few minutes later he was rice-less.\r\n\r\nThe meal went on for a very long time, with numerous toasts and pledges of undying friendship.  When I asked my interpreter about the rice, she whispered, “It’s coming.”  \r\n\r\nFinally the orange slices were served, the final item in a traditional Chinese feast.  Then my hosts got up, accepted my thanks, bowed, bade me goodnight and departed.  \r\n\r\nA little cross-eyed from the cognac, I staggered to the restroom.  When I returned, there, standing beside our empty table, next to my interpreter, was the waiter, holding a large bowl of rice.\r\n\r\n“But, but, but …” I stammered.  "I’m terribly sorry, but I don’t want it now.  And I can’t take it with me.  What would I do with it?”  The interpreter translated, the waiter smiled, made a brief, pleasant remark and took his leave, rice bowl and all.  Clearly, my refusal of the rice was no big deal.\r\n\r\nOut on the sidewalk, I asked my interpreter to explain what the heck was going on.\r\n\r\n“First,” she said, “it took a long time because they probably had to send someone to a grocery to buy the rice, bring it back and cook it.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.  You see, a restaurant of that quality would never have rice on the menu.  It’s the lowest form of food and no good restaurant offers it.”\r\n\r\n“But Chinese people love rice, right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and we eat it every day.  But an honored guest like yourself would never, never be served rice unless your hosts were so extremely poor that rice was absolutely the only food they had to offer.”\r\n\r\nI was amazed.  She explained a little more, saying, “In America, you often eat breakfast cereal, correct?  But if you gave a dinner party for an honored guest who had come 13,000 miles to visit you, would you serve breakfast cereal?   Even with your own family and friends, is breakfast cereal your Holiday Feast?  No.  It would be an insult to serve an item so humble, unless you had nothing else on your shelf.”\r\n\r\nI began to understand.  “Why did the waiter bring the bowl at all?”\r\n\r\n“Because you asked for it.  You’re the honored guest and if you ask for something, you’re going to get it, whatever it is.  But you notice that the waiter did not appear with the rice until everyone else had departed.  He did not want the others to see him bringing you a bowl of rice.”\r\n\r\nIt was a valuable lesson.  Tea is not just hot liquid and rice is not just belly-timber.  Taiwan is a long way from Ohio.  The world is wide.  Food isn’t just provender.  It connotes, signifies, symbolizes.  Different foods mean different things in different lands.  \r\n\r\nThink about that as you listen to my little theme-and-variations, entitled "A Variety of Herb Teas,” the final movement from A Little Breakfast Music, played by oboist Robert Franz, clarinetist Phoenix Malek and violinists Brandon Christensen and Corinne Cook.  click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 19, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),57);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(37,replace(replace('Odell Shepard’s The Harvest of a Quiet Eye is a tapestry of essays and poems recounting a walking journey the author made through rural Connecticut in September of 1926.  An engaging minor classic of the literature of walking, the book brims with good, sweet things:  a deep affection for small towns and little rivers, an appreciation of solitude alternating with vivid character sketches and an abundance of gently humorous, pleasantly self-indulgent digressions into many other subjects.  The book is imbued with optimism and serenity.  \r\n\r\nIt''s a book I love and have read many, many times.  For years, I''ve purchased first editions of the book to give to friends.  The first edition is beautiful, printed in dark green ink on rich, creamy vellum and with broad margins.  Over a hundred illustrations.  The book even smells good!  No one is producing books like that, nowadays.\r\n\r\nShepard wrote in a way that suggests an alternative 20th century, the quiet, pastoral 20th century that might have been had we been able to dodge two world wars, the Great Depression, Cold War tensions, the strains of prolonged nuclear threat, overpopulation and the ravaging of the environment.  Shepard kept his art clean of angst and alienation. He walked and wrote in an America as refreshingly remote from our own as Oz or Middle Earth.\r\n\r\nYet he is no fantasist; he roots his appreciation for the beauty of life in a full acceptance of its transience.  \r\n \r\nWho was he?  Odell Shepard (1884-1967) was a professor of English literature at Trinity College, a newspaper columnist, a pianist and singer, an indefatigable walker and trout fisherman, and even, for one term, lieutenant governor of Connecticut!  Shepard wrote well on an astonishingly diverse array of topics and in nearly every literary form.  His biography of Bronson Alcott won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize.  His novels Jenkins’ Ear, and Holdfast Gaines, co-authored with his son, were successful Book-of-the-Month Club selection.  Books on Connecticut history, Shakespeare, and trout-fishing as well as essays, poems, newspaper columns and editings of other writers whose work he admired poured from his pen in the 1920’s and ‘30’s.  Two of his books, The Heart of Thoreau''s Journals and his masterful study of the unicorn myth, The Lore of the Unicorn, have never gone out of print.\r\n\r\nRhapsodizing in prose, his writing is strikingly good, quietly dignified yet impassioned, a noble, flowing, musical prose that aspires to poetry.  If this was music, we''d describe it as tonal and melodic.	\r\n\r\nI''ve set to music several of his poems and in 2010 I wrote my only extended dramatic work, adapting Shepard''s account, in The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, of his encounter with a grim marsh-land, "livid with Death."  He dares to try to hear what the Marsh is "saying" to him; she asserts Nature''s indifference to our brief human experiment with consciousness.  It nearly undoes him. A message like that, if we really take it in, can just about undo any of us.  \r\n\r\nThen, rejoicing in the beauty of the dying leaves of autumn, he affirms Life all the more heartily and strides "with high-hearted singing" to the end of his day''s hike, crossing the bridge and seeing the light of his inn "at the far end shining."  I take the bridge as a metaphor for our journeys’ end in Death and the inn, with its shining lights, as a metaphor of a welcoming, restful afterlife.\r\n\r\nMy cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye is in twelve-movements, scored for baritone (who sings the role of Shepard, the hiker-narrator), soprano (who sings the words of the Marsh-land), chorus (who comments on the action), four-part chorus and a miniature orchestra consisting of a flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nJust now I want to share the last two movements:  the baritone solo in which Shepard so beautifully comes to terms with Death, followed by the Finale for baritone, chorus and instruments when he finishes his hike, crossing the bridge at last.\r\n\r\nHere are the words:\r\n\r\nMovement #11:  It is true that I am walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death and that soon I shall lie down there, never to rise, and that every flower and face and thought that I have known, together with all that my fellows have thought and dreamed and made, will lie there very soon beside me.  But yet it is a most beautiful valley and I have always loved it and I love it more deeply at every step that brings me nearer the end. Why then should I grieve to lie here forever?  The oak and the maple are dying too and they comfort me.  For they do not dwindle and pine into the grave but go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas as though they have some expectation of joy, some intuition that from this dying world unimaginable life may spring as the new year springs from the ruins of the old.  In such company at least I can say that I will fear no evil.\r\n\r\nMovement #12:  The sun was setting behind the mountains and a breeze awoke in the sky.  The new moon was blown bare of clouds and the stars shown round her like a shining wreath.  By her pale illumination I found my way.  I strode along with high-hearted singing until at last I could see the bridge and finally the light of my inn at the far end shining.\r\n\r\nThat ending touches my heart; when I hear this music my throat tightens, tears come.

The author of this book, Odell Shepard, borrowed the title from a poem by Wordsworth:\r\n\r\nThe outward shows of sky and earth,\r\nOf hill and valley he has viewed;\r\nAnd impulses of deeper birth \r\nHave come to him in solitude.\r\n\r\nIn common things that round us lie\r\nSome random truths he can impart, --\r\nThe harvest of a quiet eye \r\nThat broods and sleeps on his own heart.\r\n\r\nMy cantata opens with a choral setting of those noble words.  What follows are settings of Shepard''s account of his encounter with a grim Marsh-land, "livid with Death."  He dares to try to hear what the Marsh is "saying" to him; she asserts Nature''s indifference to our brief human experiment and it nearly undoes him.  A message like that, if we really take it in, leads to despair.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, surprised, he finds himself remembering the “brave, high-hearted songs” his fellow human beings have sung and he rejoices in that memory and in the beauty of the dying autumn leaves that “go down trooping their colors and shouting hosannas."  He affirms our  human adventure all the more heartily and strides through what remains of his day’s hike (and, we feel, through what will remain of his life), "with high-hearted singing."\r\n\r\nToday I''ll share just the two-minute opening movement.  I think this sounds like an opening, a beginning.  From the git-go, it''s expansive.  Something is astir.  Good things lie ahead.  It’s like the opening credits of a well-scored film.\r\n\r\nThe work is in twelve movements, scored for baritone (singing the role of Shepard, the hiker-narrator), soprano (the haunting voice of the Marsh-land), chorus (commenting on the action) and a miniature orchestra:  flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano.\r\n\r\nTo hear the opening movement of The Harvest Quiet Eye, in the premiere performance by the Cincinnati Camerata under the direction of Chris Miller, click on the link above.  \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 22, 2015\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\nHappy Easter.  Speaking of which … \r\n\r\n	<< The God many Christians worship is far too small.  God is not a “tribal” God, somewhere “out there,” belonging only to Judaism or Christianity.  It’s no wonder so many educated, postmodern people have given up on such a God … not nearly as big as science is discovering the universe itself to be. >>   \r\n											— Richard Rohr\r\n\r\nFor many, the reported bigness of the universe staggers Faith.  Belief is rattled, too, by what we’re told of the History of the universe and its bleak, inexorable future.\r\n\r\nWe ‘educated, postmodern people’ are not the first to find that such discoveries are at odds with Religion.  Even before Galileo there must always have been a long list of seemingly solid reasons to reject the sacredness of materiality, to remain willfully blind to the implications of consciousness, to resist the tempting notion of God.\r\n\r\nMy only extended dramatic vocal work, my cantata, “The Harvest of a Quiet Eye,” is a setting of excerpts from the book of that title by Odell Shepard; it addresses, in a drama, the issue that Rohr raises in an essay. \r\n\r\nIn the book, as in the cantata, the story is told of a solitary walker who encounters a marsh and dares to face what he perceives to be its grim message:  that all Life dies, that this unutterably vast universe is devoid of meaning, that these assertions obviate and render empty the notion of God.  The story does not stop there; surprisingly, it leads to a resurrection of Faith and ends in triumphant serenity.\r\n\r\nSometimes I find that “the world is charged with the Grandeur of God.”  Other times the notion of God seems absurd and sentimental.  I have good friends who cannot grasp why I show up, every Sunday, at a church service.  Their notion of God is, I think, narrow.  That’s why it seems ridiculous to them.  I agree.  A narrow notion of God IS ridiculous.  As with the Christians Rohr references, many an ardent atheist clings to a concept of God that "is far too small.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I find myself bewildered, I try to remember to do what the solitary walker does in response to the grim assertions of the Marsh.   I think about Consciousness, our human consciousness, unique, incredible, mysterious and inexplicable … no one knows what it is nor how it came to be … let alone, even more importantly, WHY it came to be.  Who among us can answer that question?  \r\n\r\nWhen I ponder such questions I find myself traipsing into the realms of Theology.  And there I find solace and certitude.  The absurdly narrow idea of the tribal God of the Abrahamic Religions, that ''Big Man with the Long White Beard Who’s Got His Finger In Every Pie,'' shrivels away.  I am left filled with wonder, awe and humility.  At such moments I have a yearning to worship. \r\n\r\nTo be sure, such moments do not always coincide with my attendance at the weekly 11 a.m. Sunday morning services at Cincinnati''s Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church, my church, our church.  But church attendance keeps me in touch with the notion of God and puts me into the company of friends who share my curiosity about such things.\r\n\r\nThe solitary walker in The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, after taking on board what the Marsh has to tell, remembers "our habitable little globe and the fires we have kindled, building them on the edges of the abyss and lighting only our own faces against the ring of darkness, but still ... fires.”\r\n\r\nHe recalls "the brave high-hearted songs we sing as though the dark were not, the songs that tally all our faiths, our hopes, our dreams, the brave high-hearted songs we’ve made to sing us through the dark, the songs that tally all our faiths, our joys and lamentations, our yearnings, our illusions and our heroic hopes."\r\n\r\nFinally, this leads him to rejoice in the astonishing fact of our human consciousness.  \r\n\r\nThe climactic tenth movement of the cantata is the four-part choral fugue I made, setting to music, as passionately as I could, the noble words he gives us at that moment:  \r\n\r\n	"It may be that Nature did not foresee us, but in all her kingdoms she has brought forth no other such pathetic and marvelous thing as this human heart, so trivial and heroic, so dauntless though so filled with fears, that can smile into the eyes of Death.”\r\n\r\nResurrection!\r\n\r\nTo hear my fugue, “It May Be That Nature,” the tenth movement of my cantata The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, from the 12/3/16 performance by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus, with Edward Elwyn Jones conducting, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 16, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!”\r\n\r\nThat’s what Ophelia says about Hamlet.  That’s what I fear you might say about me when you hear the piece of music I am going to share today, if you’ll permit me.\r\n\r\nIt’s the “Song of the Marsh” from my cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, my only extended dramatic vocal work, a setting of excerpts from the book of that title by Odell Shepard.\r\n\r\nIn the book, as in the cantata, the story is told of a solitary walker who encounters a marsh and dares to hear its grim message:  that this unutterably vast universe is devoid of meaning.  The story does not stop there; surprisingly, it leads to a resurrection of faith, celebrating consciousness and ending in triumphant serenity.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, on Easter Sunday, I shared the triumphant music that follows in response to the "Song of the Marsh."  Some of you kindly asked to hear the song itself.  Today you will.\r\n\r\nMost of my music is tame, conservative, pastoral sometimes funny.  Music like that would not do justice to the powerful darkness of the monologue Shepard devised for the marsh.\r\n\r\nRead the words and imagine how YOU might set them to music ...\r\n\r\n	"Soft and dreamy seeker of pleasant emotions, you see no farther into reality than a painted butterfly flapping from flower to flower.  You too are convinced that the sun shines to warm your wings, that the meadows are strewn with flowers to flatter your delight in color.\r\n\r\n	"Stare into my vacant eyes, older than thought, older than mind-stuff, and learn more than e’er you have in pondering the wisest of books. Your poets have not told you such things as I tell, for I remember the dinosaur’s wallowing and the scream of the saber-tooth. \r\n\r\n	 "Peer down into the savageries of the under-sea. Think your way out into the infinity of the sky or down into the answering infinity of the atom. \r\n\r\n	"Stand and look at me. As I am now, so was the planet for innumerable ages before you came and so it will be for endless ages after you are gone. \r\n\r\n	"Now you may pass, for I think you will not forget."\r\n\r\nChilling sentiments, they warrant music that is beautiful but harsh, and a performance that is deeply felt but anti-sentimental.  The soprano in this performance is Jacquelyn Stucker and she is marvelous!  Her dusky lower register is perfect for the opening and closing of the song;  her higher register blossoms gorgeously when the music conveys the flower-strewn meadows and our delight in color.  She thunders like heaven’s artillery when she sings of the dinosaur’s wallowing and the scream of the saber-tooth.\r\n\r\n(Ms. Stucker told me, “This is the first time in my career that I’ve sung the word ’saber-tooth.’”  We both smiled and I said, “Well, you never know what you might be gettin’ yourself into.”)\r\n\r\nShe was featured in the 12/3/16 performance by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus under Edward Elwyn Jones, conductor, in the Sanders Theatre on the campus of Harvard University.  I’m very happy that I was able to attend the concert; it was one of the most meaningful events of my life.\r\n\r\nThis “Song of the Marsh” is, musically, far beyond the limits of my usual conservative style.  It may approach the music we might imagine Debussy to have composed, had he lived another twenty or thirty years.  \r\n\r\nIt may not be to your liking.  The music is not intended to be likable in the usual sense.  Hearing it, you may find yourself echoing Ophelia’s quip about the melancholy Dane. \r\n\r\nI hope you’ll see why I wrote it the way I did.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it a try, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 21, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),11);

Auburn Presbyterian Church choir in which I have the pleasure of singing.  He is also a fine baritone, pianist, guitarist and trumpeter.  In 2007, he asked me to write something “American-sounding” for trumpet and piano that he could play as an offertory.\r\n\r\nWhat is more American-sounding than Richard Rodgers’ score for “Oklahoma!”?  The show opens with the cowboy Curly singing, “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’.”  I decided to meet Chris’ request by paying homage to Richard Rodgers and to that song in particular.  \r\n\r\nMy piece begins and ends with Curly doing his cowboy thing.  I picture him strutting along, thumbs in his belt, cowboy hat tilted back on his head, whistling at the girls and smiling broadly.  But Curly has a reverential side, too.  Night falls and the music calms down.  Gazing up in wonder and gratitude at the stars above the prairie, Curly is moved to pray a prayer of Thanksgiving.  You’ll hear it.  And when the prayer is concluded, you’ll hear Curly  dust himself off and resume his strut and head into town, looking for fun.\r\n\r\nIn the score, I ask the trumpeter to wear a cowboy hat for the opening and final sections of the piece, but to remove it for the prayerful middle section.\r\n\r\nListen carefully and you’ll hear “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” peeking around the corners as the trumpet and piano weave fragments of the famous tune into the texture of the piece.  The entire opening phrase of the song is only heard once, at the very end.\r\n\r\nEven without being told in advance that a well-known tune was being quoted, I think you’d probably sense that there was something familiar about what you were hearing.  But I think you would be unable to identify it until the very end.  Then you’d say, “Ah-HAH!  So THAT’s why I thought I recognized something!"\r\n\r\nThe piece has never been recorded in its original trumpet/piano version.  In fact, hardly anyone has ever heard this music.  Chris played it in church once or twice but through the miracle of technology, today’s email miraculously, serves it up for the first time to you and many other friends and fans.   \r\n\r\nWhat times we live in, when such miracles are possible for people of modest means, like me.  When I think of this, I feel prompted, like Curly, to pray prayers of Thanksgiving.  Thirty years ago, the only way I could have shared this music with you would have been to produce an LP and mail it to you.  The cost would have been enormous and prohibitive.  Now, it’s almost free and requires little more than the energy it takes to press a few keys on my computer.\r\n\r\nYou will hear clarinetist Laurel Bennett and collaborative pianist Carol Alexander playing “Curly Prays:  Homage to Richard Rodgers,” by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 1, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),141);

I had booked him to perform at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, Ohio, my home town.  \r\n\r\nA Grand Baroque movie palace, built to last forever in 1925, “The Ren" was slated for demolition just five and half decades later.   A handful of Mansfielders resolved to save the theatre, inspired others to join them, hired me to lead the effort, raised money and restored it beautifully.  Ninety years old now, this historic theatre is an enduring source of pride for Mansfield.\r\n\r\nI booked and met many performers during the six years I served as Director of Renaissance, Inc.  Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Itzahk Perlman, “Alabama,” Mitzi Gaynor, Bob Hope.  It was a heady time and I was especially excited to be hosting Cab Calloway.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, my mom often played LP recordings of Cab singing his greatest hits. My brothers and I sang and danced along with her; we knew the all words.  \r\n\r\nI was very eager to meet him.  An hour before showtime he had not arrived and I was nervous.  A half hour before showtime, my stage manager, shaking his head, informed me that Mr. Calloway was in the dressing room.  Something was wrong.  I went backstage.\r\n\r\nHe was in his dressing room, yes, but he looked to be a hundred years old.  He was slumped in his chair, a very old, very tired black man in a sleeveless undershirt, staring at his knees.  I said hello.  He raised one hand in a half-wave but hardly looked up.  I told him I was a fan and that we were really looking forward to his show.  He grunted.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to say so I joined my wife in the audience.  “Hoo boy,” I told her.  “I don’t know about this.”\r\n\r\nAt length the lights went down, the band played the introduction to one of his songs, the spotlight beamed a bright circle on stage right … and we waited.  Suddenly, he came strutting out, head high, shoulders back, flashing his famous, toothy, million-dollar smile, sporting a magnificent, powder-blue tuxedo.  The Hi-Dee-Ho Man had arrived!  \r\n\r\nFor two hours, he wowed the audience, singing, dancing, telling jokes and stories and getting us all to sway our hands with him, echoing his “Hi-dee-ho’s” right on cue.\r\n\r\nStanding ovation.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he made his way up the aisle of the empty theatre to my office. He was standing tall, his tux in a clothes bag over his shoulder.  I paid him the balance of his fee, just as his contract had specified:  twenty-five one-hundred dollar bills.  He took out his wallet and it was as thick as a triple cheeseburger, stuffed with hundred-dollar bills.  He must have been carrying $40,000 in that wallet.  Cash.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of his carrying that amount of cash on the streets of downtown Mansfield being none of my business, I just told him how much we had all loved the show.  \r\n\r\nThen I added, “I have to tell you that you had me pretty worried when I saw you in your dressing room before the show.”  He asked me why.  “Well, you just seemed really tired and I didn’t know what to expect.”  \r\n\r\nHe laughed and said, “Ma-a-a-an, you got to learn to re-LAX!”  I laughed too and thanked him again.  We shook hands.  I watched him shuffle out the front door of the theatre and across Park Avenue West to the Travel Lodge.  A legendary figure of the Harlem Renaissance, a great performer, an artist who knew when to relax and when to expend his energy, he was also, at that moment, a solitary, elderly black man on the streets of downtown Mansfield, late at night, with $40,000 in his wallet.  I kept an eye on him from the theatre door until he had safely entered the motel lobby.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, it occurred to me that our church choir at Mt. Auburn Presbyterian here in Cincinnati would have a blast belting out some Cab Calloway-style “hi-dee-hi-dee-ho’s.” I adapted a quotation from G.B. Shaw because it expressed the “bright and shiny” optimism Cab put across so convincingly.  I rewrote Shaw’s words so that they would rhyme and I worked in some “hi-dee-ho’s.”   \r\n\r\nTo hear the Northern Kentucky Community Choir sing "Clean Up!” under the direction of Stephanie Nash, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nNov. 15, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),6);

It occurred to me to name the piece for Barbara herself.  I came up with “Harbachsichord,” a rich mix of puns.  \r\n\r\nLike the suite itself, the title brings together “Harbach” and “harpsichord.”  Or it could be understood as “harpsichord” with “Bach” inserted into the middle.

France, a country of 60 million, does not have, so far as I have seen, a single front porch.  \r\n\r\nFrench people love to escape the interiors of their homes, to pass time outside, to dine al fresco.  But they set up their dwelling places with outdoor access to the rear, not the front.  They create miniature worlds behind their homes, delightful flower gardens with water features and plenty of shady places designed specifically for enjoyment and surrounded with high walls.  No one sees in or out.\r\n\r\nWalking the streets of French villages or the residential areas of cities, one never glimpses these spaces, so well are they concealed.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, Americans cherish comfortable, well-appointed front porches.  We take to our front porches to drink our morning coffee, read the paper, retrieve email or just sit on a rocking chair, fingers interlocked across our bellies, content to be entertained by anything that might be happening on the sidewalk and street.  How very un-French!\r\n \r\nPeople who live on Brinkerhoff Boulevard, in Mansfield, Ohio, have it good.  Their homes are turn-of-the-century, spacious and elegant.

What''s the shortest piece by a Big Name composer?  Chopin''s so-called Minute Waltz comes to mind, but that piece actually requires a little under two minutes to perform.  The shortest piece I know is one of Beethoven''s piano bagatelles, which clocks in at 13 seconds.\r\n\r\nWell, here''s a very short piece by the undersigned, who is a Little Name composer.\r\n\r\nIt''s been almost forty years since I wrote the music you''ll hear on this recording, entitled "Beethoven Street."  It''s from a piece called "Street Suite"-- ten very short movements about streets in Mansfield, Ohio, the town where I was born and reared, played by clarinetist Craig Olzenak and violinist Ken Goldsmith.  I wanted the music to have that rumbustious energy we associate with Beethoven.  And since it''s a short street, it had to be a short piece of music.\r\n\r\nForty years!  Yet when you hear this, it will be as fresh as this morning''s sunrise.  That''s the great thing about classical music.  It has no ''shelf time.''   A piece of music that is new to us feels like it was written five minutes ago.  Amazing.\r\n\r\nI wrote the "Street Suite" shortly after getting free of college, after five hard years of servitude.  Ugh.  At last I was free to write the music I wanted to write, well outside the groves of Academe, where I have thrived ever since.  I think the joyfulness of this new freedom can be heard in the music.  But I don''t want to make too much of it;  it''s just a little piece; it attempts nothing grander than a little smile.  And that''s OK.  Let us never undervalue things that prompt little smiles.

Taipei County, Taiwan and Richland County, Ohio, are sister counties.  Organizing exchange tours was a fun part of my work when I served as a County Commissioner, 1986-1990.  (I am, so far as I know, the only American composer of classical music ever elected to a public office.)\r\n\r\nWe got to see Taipei, Taiwan''s capitol city, as well as the country’s rugged coast, its mountains peaking at 13,000 feet, the Polynesian culture that still thrives in the interior, Yang Ming Shan National Park, and the great museum displaying the personal art objects cherished by a 5,000-year-long string of Chinese Emperors.\r\n\r\nThe objet d''art in the museum that most impressed me was a peach pit.  It was exhibited in a glass case with Sherlock-style magnifying glasses mounted on four sides so that visitors could give it the close inspection it deserved.  \r\n\r\nIt was carved into the shape of a tiny boat afloat on the wavelets of a diminutive stream, with a miniscule pagoda mid-ships in which sat a scholar holding an infinitesimal cup of tea from which — I swear — a hair’s breadth tendril of steam curled upward!  \r\n\r\nAll this!  A carved peach pit!\r\n  \r\nAfter a long series of grand banquets provided by our generous hosts, Jo and I were afforded an evening to ourselves.  We had been amazed by the Chinese cuisine but amazement can be wearying.  We were eager to find familiar fare.\r\n\r\nOur Chinese hosts deposited us in a so-called “Western” restaurant.  We took the decor to be an expression of the Chinese notion of Western civilization.  There was a bust of Beethoven next to the cash register and a print of Monet’s Water Lilies on the wall, displayed, oddly, in a shiny, bright red, Chinese picture frame.  \r\n\r\nBut the most striking exhibit inviting us to imagine that we had, for the nonce, left China and re-entered Western civilization awaited us in the center of the dining room.   \r\n\r\nA low, circular wall of bricks enclosed an area over which sand had been spread, covering the floorboards.  Prominently placed in the sand were three large, shiny, plastic objets d''art.  One was a cream-colored plastic Greek column, about five feet tall, made to look as if it was broken, a ruin, the crumbling remnant of a temple.  The second was a glistening, green, plastic cactus plant, about six feet tall.  \r\n\r\nThe third — I am not inventing this — was a figure about four feet tall, clad in his traditional blue nautical jacket, his white sailor’s hat tilted back on his head, his smiling bill a bright yellow.  Yes, there he stood, pleased to take his place between the phony Greek column and the fake cactus, that enduring emblem of Western civilization:  Donald Duck.\r\n\r\nApparently, for the restaurant''s regular Chinese customers, those three objects, taken together, proclaimed “The West.” \r\n\r\nThe food was, well … you can imagine.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the decor in our local Chinese restaurants, to say nothing of menu items like Chop Suey and fortune cookies, would probably seem just as absurd to any Chinese people who might eat there as the decor of the “Western” restaurant in Taipei seemed to us.  Enter most any Chinese restaurant in Ohio and what do you see?  A plastic Buddha, some more-or-less Chinese art on the walls, in bright red frames, weird red lanterns hanging from the acoustic tile ceiling, a large photo of the Great Wall.  We glance and think, “Yes, definitely Chinese.”  What do we know?  Most Chinese would probably find plenty to laugh about in such a display.\r\n\r\nThe ten short movements of my Street Suite for violin and clarinet attempt to depict and evoke ten streets in my hometown, Mansfield, Ohio.

We’ve attended almost every year since 1973 and it never fails to move us to tears.\r\n\r\nSome things are beyond the power of words to express.  I remember thinking, when we were on the island of Kauai, “How will I ever convey the beauty of this place to the folks back in Ohio?”  We can only recount the bare facts of the experience and attach a label to our emotional response.\r\n\r\nThe Boar’s Head Festival is like that.  The facts are:  150 volunteer performers in gorgeous costumes, carrying lovingly crafted props, present a Christmas pageant with the  accompaniment of a large chorus and full orchestra.  The SRO crowd adds their voices to those of the choir as familiar carols alternate with solos sung by the ‘stars’ of the cast.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Revels opens with the majestic “Boar’s Head Carol,” enjoining the attendees to sing along with the chorus.  It’s a joyful tune with joyful words, yet I weep all through it, as I do pretty much throughout the whole pageant.\r\n\r\nHow shall I label our emotional response?  What is it, exactly, that moves us so powerfully?\r\n\r\nThe Boar’s Head Festival demonstrates what humanity can achieve when we are at our best.  Responding to the beauty of it, the humor, the majesty, the heartfelt reverence, cast and audience alike are brought to an awareness of our common humanity.  We feel that, despite all the hideousness, the cruelty, the greed, the terror we humans inflict, there is something wonderful about us after all, something that redeems us.\r\n\r\nWhy is this moving?  We are each profoundly different from the rest.  We arrive at every present moment by way of distinct and separate paths, long and winding paths that have led us all through deep shadows and sunny glens.  It is miraculous that we can communicate with one another at all.\r\n\r\nWhen, as part of an audience, we are moved by a shared experience, the awareness of our differences seems to drop away for a little while, our solitude is relieved.  The tears we weep are tears of joy, relief and solace.\r\n\r\nMy little set of variations on The Boar’s Head Carol is a light and humble work, scored for just three musicians.  It falls far short of the splendor of the Boar’s Head Festival that inspired it.  Yet it is my sincere homage to the good people of Christ Church Cathedral, my expression of gratitude for the joy they have brought their audiences every Christmas since 1940.\r\n\r\nThis seems an appropriate moment to quote the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.  He said, “There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers.”\r\n\r\nPlease accept this piece as my sincere attempt to bring you joy.\r\n\r\nTo hear Variations on The Boar’s Head Carol splendidly performed by the Mirecourt Trio (violinist Ken Goldsmith, cellist Terry King, pianist John Jensen), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 20, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),159);

Rhythms and harmonies must be simple.  The words must suit the tune and the meaning of the words must suit the theology of the congregation who will be expected to sing it.  \r\n\r\nThe tune must be simple, yes, but it must also be sufficiently catchy to withstand unvaried repetition as several verses are sung.

Just the bare bones, but with a twist at the end:  a descending, four-note “Blues-y” figure closes the tune each time.  I had fun figuring out ways to alter that Blues-y touch at the end of each variation.

The road rises, then very considerately levels off, then rises again, then goes level again.  A thoughtful road, a humane road, a civilized road!   \r\n\r\nAt length the slow climb is rewarded with a long, leisurely descent through lovely Macedonia Brook State Park.  Dense pine forests, a wealth of ferns, quaint little log bridges across the brook, campers happily rustling up breakfast, an occasional whiff of frying bacon on the breeze.  Paradise!\r\n\r\nIt was my first ride wearing my new helmet.  Black with gray trim, very handsome, contrasting quite nicely, I’ve been told, with my white beard and mustache.  I always wear black shorts when I bike.  Usually I wear dark purple woolen socks, but those were wet in the washer so I had put on my black socks.  As it happened, I had pulled on a black t-shirt.  \r\n\r\nAs I crossed the Housatonic, I suddenly realized that I was all in black.  Like Zorro.  Like hunky young Marlon Brando in his motorcycle jacket.  Like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in "Men in Black.”  Like “V,” the shadowy opponent of oppression in “V for Vendetta."\r\n\r\nCool.  Who would I be?  “The Black Bikesman.”  That’s who!\r\n\r\nThus, it was with a ‘certain air of savoir faire’ that I pulled into Kent, pleasantly conscious that I "cut a figure."  Not only was I lookin’ good, but I had just completed a vigorous, healthful ride of about 17 miles over the mountain, a stunt not every 60-something can pull off.\r\n\r\nFather’s Day.  With my kids far away, my daughter in Washington DC, my son back in Cincinnati, I decided to treat myself.   I locked my bike to a tree and made for the nearest sidewalk cafe, crowded with interesting-looking people, New Yorkers weekending in Connecticut.  After a bit, I secured coffee and a raisin-oatmeal cookie.  As I exited through the crowd, a young man said, "Excuse me, sir.  I thought you might like to know that your t-shirt is inside-out."\r\n\r\nI thanked him, though I would have preferred to have remained ignorant.  I chose a chair among the sidewalk tables that would allow me to sit with my back to the wall, hoping no one else would notice the big white t-shirt tag on the nape of my neck.  I dunked my cookie and drank my coffee, my enjoyment somewhat compromised.\r\n\r\nFinally, I got up, tossed my paper cup in the trashcan and hit the sidewalks.  I felt the eyes of my fellow pedestrians behind me.  “Pathetic old guy,” they’d be thinking.  “Can’t even put on his t-shirt correctly anymore.”  \r\n\r\nI had to get my t-shirt right-side-out.  The question was where to do it.  I didn''t want to strip off my t-shirt and present myself bare-chested, however briefly, on a crowded sidewalk.  Connecticut was settled by Puritans and their influence lingers yet in the state’s “Blue Laws.”  For all I knew, going shirtless on a public sidewalk in Connecticut could be a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThere are many shops in Kent, mostly in houses that were formerly homes.  I made my way to the backyard of one of these and went behind a big, old maple tree.  I looked around, to be sure that I was unobserved.  That was when I noticed a woman staring at me from inside.  She rapped her knuckles on the window, wagging her forefinger, shaking her head, frowning.   She had obviously formed the notion that I was about to relieve myself on her tree.\r\n\r\nAt a loss as to how to convey to her my actual intention by pantomiming, I returned to the sidewalk, trying to think what to do.\r\n\r\nI went into a classy dress shop and asked if I could use a dressing room.  "I just need to take off my shirt and then put it right back on," I explained to the clerk.  This gave her pause.  It must have come across as a facile fib, cloaking darker intentions.  She gave me a long look and then said that dressing rooms were for customers only and directed me to the public restrooms, several blocks away.\r\n\r\nI headed that direction.  The sidewalks were crowded with families, couples young and old, attractive women of all ages and many men, all of whom had managed to don their t-shirts right side out.  I could imagine a young mother observing me closely from behind and telling her children, "This is why you must be alert, pay attention and do well in school -- so that, when you are old, you don''t end up walking around in public with your t-shirt inside out." \r\n\r\nWhen I got to the public restroom, there was another man in there, standing, making appropriate use of the facility.  Somehow I didn''t want to take off my shirt while he was there.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had no other reason for being in the restroom and it is not a place for lingering.  So, just to be doing something, I washed my hands.  Soon, he was at the sink next to mine, washing his hands, too.  “Your t-shirt’s inside-out," he observed.  \r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," I said.  "That''s the way they''re wearing them now.  It''s like wearing your base-ball cap backwards.  It makes a statement."\r\n\r\nI caught his face at an angle, in the mirror.  He rolled his eyes, sighed, and left without another word.  \r\n\r\nFinally alone and out of sight of my public, I quickly yanked my t-shirt off, turned it right-side-out and pulled it back on.\r\n\r\nMy confidence regained, I went outside.  \r\n\r\nThe Black Bikesman was back.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer play the second movement from my Father’s Day Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 19, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello —\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I sent you an email featuring an unusually dark and grim piece of mine, "The Song of the Marsh."\r\n\r\nI hesitated to share it because my predominant impulse is to purvey sweetness and light, to be a reliable fount of good cheer, "enchanting one and all with my bright smile and merry sallies,” as Bertie Wooster puts it.\r\n\r\nThat’s why these Sunday morning emails have mostly offered selections of my music which are sunny and pert, gay and bobbish, suggestive of a world in which everything is okey-doke, hunkum-bunkum, even boompsa-daisy.  \r\n\r\nWho wants to hear music, I said to myself, that evokes desolation and despair?  and on a Sunday morning, yet?  Aren''t the inherent tragedies of life and the dreary drumbeat of the daily news sufficiently difficult to bear without sorrowful music, yet?\r\n\r\nWell, I may have been wrong.  In fact, I may have got it exactly backwards.  Could it be that sad music is sometimes exactly what helps us bear up?  “We have art,” someone said, “so that we do not perish from the truth.”  Give us, sometimes, a sad song so that we do not perish from sadness.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, on the Sunday morning after I had finally made bold to send out my "Song of Marsh," a good friend approached me at church to tell me how much it had meant to him to discover a darker side in my work.  He shared, “I’m pretty dark, you know … I don’t need  everything perky all the time … in fact, I love melancholy music.”\r\n\r\nHere’s a secret:  I do, too!\r\n\r\nListen to my suites and you’ll often find a dark movement tucked in amongst a high-kickin’ chorus line of happy movements, flanking their dark sister on either side.  \r\n\r\nWhat’s that dark mugwump movement doing in a such company?  you might ask.\r\n\r\nRemember when we studied Shakespeare in High School English class?  We were taught that Shakespeare inserted the gravedigger into “Hamlet” and the gatekeeper into “MacBeth” so that the audience would have some “comic relief.”  \r\n\r\nWell, I think of my occasional, isolated, mugwump movements as “tragic relief” from the jollity surrounding them.\r\n\r\nThree of the four movements of my Father’s Day Suite are ''happy as a clam,'' but today I want to share the third movement, a mournful fugue, my humble attempt to emulate the pathos and depth of feeling we find in parts of Beethoven’s probing late quartets.\r\n\r\nTo hear it beautifully played by violinist Kris Frankenfeld, violist Belinda Burge and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash \r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 18, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),38);

When National Public Radio acknowledges the support of the National Endowment for the Arts, the announcement concludes with a terse, no-nonsense assertion:\r\n\r\n	“Art works.”\r\n\r\nWord play on “artworks.”  I get it.  Clever.  \r\n\r\nStill … may I grumble?  \r\n\r\n(As our world slides toward chaos, my grumble is small stuff.  But you might get a smile out of it.  Bear in mind that I’m half-joking….)\r\n\r\nSaying that “art works" seems to imply that art needs to be justified …  that it is somehow effective "after all" ... that it demonstrates competence and productivity, workplace virtues  highly prized in a workaday world.  \r\n\r\nArt, it turns out, has a function!  Art has value.  Why?  Because it works!   \r\n\r\nArt, we are assured, is on the job.  Busy!  Occupied!  \r\n\r\nWho knew?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, announcing that ''art works’ makes that valid claim that art is an industry, an employer of thousands.  \r\n\r\nI remember this when I hear of schools dropping art and music classes on the grounds that such subjects are not career-related.  I want to shout, “What about ME?”  \r\n\r\nThe music classes of my 7th-12th grade years were the foundation of my entire career.  For me, those courses were a crucial preparation.  \r\n\r\nIn the phrase "art works” I also hear the notion that art is somehow an antidote to societal woes, a remedy for sundry public malaises, good medicine for our culture.  Duly noted.  Art can sometimes be a panacea of sorts.\r\n\r\nStill, the phrase has the same slightly defensive tone we hear when someone goes to bat for alternative medicine, “Acupuncture works!”   \r\n\r\nThe phrase implies that, in an ongoing argument about the efficacy of art, our side is losing, that ours is the uphill struggle, the battle against the odds.  Maybe so.  Maybe it’s not enough just to “do” art.  Maybe we must also try to convince whoever is listening that the conventional wisdom about art (that it doesn’t work) is wrong.  The NEA is rallying us, defiantly shouting back:  “But, don’t you see?  It does work!"\r\n\r\nTo my ear, the phrase strikes pre-emptively against the assumption that artists are slackers who expect the rest of us to support them. \r\n\r\nNot so!  But … no wonder there are so many grumpy artists! \r\n\r\nI read about a study some scholar undertook, probing the psyches of The Great Composers.  The scholar read all their letters and diaries and all that was written about them by their acquaintances, in the hope of plumbing the depths of their being.  In plain American, he wanted to get a handle on what kinda guys they were, psychologically-speaking-wise. \r\n\r\nThe scholar discovered that The Great Composers had one trait in common:  irritability.  \r\n\r\nI had to laugh.  I’m sure it’s true.\r\n\r\nBach, Beethoven and Brahms were notoriously grumpy.  Chopin threw a chair at a student.  You didn’t want to get on the wrong side of Wagner.   Charles Ives was a grouch of the first magnitude.  Sibelius, permanently ticked off, composed nothing in the last thirty years of his life.  That showed ‘em.\r\n\r\nWhoa.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that irked them so?  \r\n\r\nSome slob sidled up to them at a party, stood too close, put an unwelcome arm around their shoulders and, puffing beer breath into their face, slurred out the words, … “Lemme tell ya somethin'', old timer.

In the “Waltz” movement, which I want to share with you today, I tried something different.  No folk tunes are quoted; the tunes are my own.  Instead, I attempted to blend a Russian style —  something like Rachmaninoff’s -- with my own American style.\r\n\r\nI admire Rachmaninoff.  He didn’t cave.  When the modernism of Schoenberg and Stravinsky overtook the musical world, he carried forward the banner of Romanticism.  His best music is unabashedly tonal, melodic and ‘from the heart.''\r\n\r\nHe demonstrates that Romanticism is not confined to a particular era.  It is one end of a timeless spectrum; the other end is Classicism.  The ancient Greeks mythologized these opposing artistic impulses as two gods:  Dionysius and Apollo.  Any artwork of any era takes a position on this spectrum.  On one end, the Dionysian/Romantic extreme,  hysteria and chaos reign.  At the opposing Apollonian/Classical extreme, order and an austere calm are imposed.\r\n\r\nRachmaninoff’s best works veer toward the warmer end.  That’s not to say that his work is chaotic or hysterical (he’s not Tchaikovsky).  Rachmaninoff emphasizes passionate feeling and expressivity.\r\n\r\nThe beginning and ending of the little Waltz movement from my “Sunny Days” suite aspire to the warmth of a good tune by Rachmaninoff.  The longer middle section is warm, too, but sounds very American, a gentle Appalachian folk song.  \r\n\r\nAnother duality is in the scoring.  The piano opens the movement alone, then falls silent while the violin and clarinet play together.  The three come together only when the American-sounding music begins.  Then the piano goes silent again while the others play.  Then it’s just clarinet and piano.  Then just violin and clarinet.  Finally the three reunite, the violin strumming guitar-like pizzicatos.  The piano repeats the music of its opening solo, the other instruments finally joining in, closing the movement.\r\n\r\nTo hear the Waltz from Sunny Days played tenderly and beautifully by violinist Paul Patterson, clarinetist Anthony Costa and pianist Phil Amalong, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nDec. 11, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA lot of my music is “programmatic,” i.e., more or less about something non-musical.  A season, a place, a personality, an idea, an homage to or parody of another composer or musical genre.\r\n\r\nMusic that is not “programmatic” is called “absolute music,” i.e., not intended to be about anything.  It’s just music; make of it what you will.\r\n\r\nYet, for many people, music -- all music, any music — brings vivid images to mind.  At the reception after a performance of one of my pieces — I forget which piece exactly but it was not a “programmatic” piece -- a lady told me that she had “especially liked the part where the squirrels were playing in the leaves.”  I had no idea what she was talking about but I nodded and said, “Thank you."\r\n\r\nThat was a comical moment for me but I am sure the lady was serious; she was certain her image was accurate and precise and that I would know to which part of the piece she was referring.\r\n\r\nWho is to say, after all?  Once a piece is written, the composer is just another listener; his opinions are not definitive.  For all I know, maybe metaphorical squirrels were at play in that section.\r\n\r\nWhen I hear the third movement from my Suite for Three Violins, an example of “absolute music,” I find myself imagining a long, narrow, brightly-colored, silk pennant rising and falling in a gentle breeze.  \r\n\r\nI suppose I could title it, “Long, Narrow, Brightly-colored, Silk Pennant Rising and Falling in a Gentle Breeze.”  \r\n\r\nSuch a title would have almost as strong a claim as, “Squirrels Playing in the Leaves.”\r\n\r\nMusic sometimes prompts these mysterious mental responses.  \r\n\r\nI wonder what images piece might elicit from you.  Maybe none at all.  Maybe you’ll shrug and say, “It’s just nice music.”   \r\n\r\nThat’s OK, too.\r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement from my Suite for Three Violins, played with snap and verve by three superb Cincinnati violinists -- Kris Frankenfeld, Frankie Howard and Elizabeth Steva — and recorded by the great Cincinnati sound engineer John Burgess, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 15, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),39);

We lived there from 1986 to 1994, inhabiting a charming, 19th-century home with fireplaces, cozy low ceilings, wormy chestnut beams, exposed brick walls, old windows with wavy glass and little bubbles in the panes.  We were surrounded by hardwood forest on three sides and our two-thirds of an acre boasted no less than forty mighty oak trees.  \r\n\r\nEvery spring the yard burst forth in, truly, about 10,000 daffodils.  Previous owners had planted them but we dug up the bulbs, busted them apart and replanted them so that they spread and spread, more each year.  The results were amazing.  The yard looked like a movie set or the cover of a bulb-seller’s mail-order brochure.  Villagers walked past our house, just to see the display of daffodils.  \r\n\r\nBest of all, our kids were little and, every moment of every day, we felt that we were, not just a couple, but a family living together.\r\n\r\nOur next door neighbor was Susan Browning, a devoted amateur clarinetist and a passionate dog-lover.  Sometimes she called to ask if our noble Springer spaniel, whom we had named “Binsche,” would like to come along with Trim, her stately, beautiful collie, for an ice cream cone treat.  The dogs would pile into Susan''s car and we’d watch as Susan backed out of our driveway, the dogs’ heads already sticking out the partially rolled-down back windows, tongues out, ears flapping in the wind.  When the three of them returned, Susan would very seriously assure us that “the boys” had enjoyed their ice cream, as if we had doubted if such would be case and were in need of assurance.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Susan commissioned me to write a suite for unaccompanied clarinet.  She did not want a virtuoso concert work, just a set of fun, short pieces that she could play at home for her own amusement. \r\n\r\nI wrote twelve little pieces for her, collectively entitled, “A College Town Diary: 12 Months in Gambier.”\r\n\r\nThe piece is a “diary,” i.e., a private journal of thoughts, sentiments and sarcasms, carefully recorded but not necessarily intended for public scrutiny.  Being a “diary,” the piece is personal, opinionated and a little eccentric … like Susan … like myself.\r\n\r\nTwelve movements — even short movements — would make a long haul for a clarinetist performing unaccompanied in front of an audience.  Now and then clarinetists have fashioned a handful of the movements into short suites, more suitable for concert use.  That’s fine with me.  A few years ago, I devised a “Suite from A College Town Diary,” arranging six of the movements for clarinet and piano.\r\n\r\n(By the way, I’ll gladly send PDFs of these scores — free — to any of you who are interested.  Just ask.)\r\n\r\nThese days, Jo and I live in the historic heart of Cincinnati, a city with much to admire culturally, scenically, historically and some things to deplore, such as the nation''s second-highest rates of homelessness, hunger and poverty.  \r\n\r\nWe moved here for the educational opportunities the city offered our children.  After they graduated from Cincinnati’s celebrated School for the Creative & Performing Arts and left home, Jo and I stayed on in Cincinnati.  We wouldn’t be as happy in Gambier now, not without our little kids living at home with us.  And we’ve changed, too;  a tiny Ohio college town, surrounded by woods and cornfields, would feel too small for us now.\r\n\r\nThat difference is particularly felt during the month of March.  March is no treat in an Ohio city but in rural Ohio, March is bleak, almost unbearable.  Muddy, cold, gray and no holidays, except when Easter comes early.  St. Patrick’s Day doesn’t amount to much in a rural Ohio village.  Cincinnati’s Bockfest and March Madness are unknown in the Buckeye hinterland.\r\n\r\nOr rather, in a college town, there are no March holidays for the Townies.  For the students and faculty, there’s Spring Break!  They get to leave!  It’s the one joyous thing about March!  Off they go, to warmer places where they will, you may be assured, like Binsche and Trim, enjoy their ice cream.  Thus, my “March” movement is joyful after all!   And less than 90 seconds long.\r\n\r\n(The music for the “March” movement is not a march, by the way.  More like a leaping-and-bounding dance.  I reserved the notion of writing a march for the “July” movement, to evoke Gambier’s delightful Fourth of July parade.)\r\n\r\nTo hear Bill Perconti play “March” from A College Town Diary:  Twelve Months in Gambier on the alto saxophone, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 6, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThe French word for “tire” is “pneu.”  \r\n\r\nGet this:  it’s pronounced "puh-neu”.  The “p” is not silent!\r\n\r\nWhat?  "Puh-neu?”  Yep ... er, “Oui.”\r\n\r\nThis comes as a shock.  A belated April Fool’s Day joke, you ask?  No … er, “Non."\r\n\r\nSilent letters are the April Fool’s Day joke played on us, every day, by our language.\r\n\r\nLife isn''t sufficiently complicated?  How were all these silent letters foisted upon us?  \r\n\r\nThe answer is pedantic.  I know parts of it, but I say phooey.  Mocking pedantry is always more fun than being pedantic.  So, in the spirit of April Fool’s Day, let’s have some laughs.\r\n\r\nLet’s focus on the silent “p” and its cohort in crime, the silent “w."  \r\n\r\nHaving no say in the matter, we tolerate, as best we can, the silent “p” when it has the temerity to precede an “n” or an “s.”  But when it precedes a “t”, as in “ptomaine," “ptarmigan" or “Ptolemy?"  Well, really.  I mean to say.  It’s a bit much.  It might even be dangerous.\r\n\r\nWhat if silent letters constitute a linguistic bacillus?  What if they were to infect neighboring words?  What might that look like?\r\n\r\n	<< Ptroubled by a ptouch of ptomaine, Wrick Psowash pspent the day wreading the writings of Ptolemy.  "If I''m ptolerably better ptomorrow," he wreckoned, “I may ptry pto ptrap a ptarmigan.” >>\r\n\r\nNot all silent “p”s are equally egregious.  We can almost forgive the silent “p” when it is followed by an “h”, as in “phallic.”\r\n\r\nAn English professor friend overheard a fragment of a conversation between two students passing his open office door:  “I know it’s a phallic symbol,” one said to the other, "but a phallic symbol of what?”   \r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nBut enough orthography.  Let’s get to some music.  Here is another way of mocking pedantry:  listen to my little piece entitled, “An Eccentric Professor,” the fourth movement of my Suite from A College Town Diary for clarinet and piano.  \r\n\r\nUsually, at this point, I credit the musicians.  Instead, paraphrasing Hollywood’s disclaimer regarding animals, I can assure you:  no musicians were harmed in the making of this mp3.  It’s not performed by anyone.  \r\n\r\nWhat you’ll hear is a MIDI file, i.e., my computer rendering the music exactly as I’ve notated it, using a music notation program.  It sounds robotic, but that’s OK for this particular piece because part of the joke is that the music is NOT flexible or expressive.  \r\nThe tune waddles along, like an eccentric professor in shabby corduroys, crossing the campus, chomping a pipe, lugging a battered, bulging briefcase, badly in need of a haircut, his mind long since made up, once and for all, on just about everything.  “Often wrong but never in doubt!"\r\n\r\nTo hear “Eccentric Professor,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 2, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),161);

It’s an attractive notion; it''s brought me exhilaration and relief.  It liberates the religious impulse from intellectual tedium.  A person is religious, not because they’ve convinced themselves that they can prove the existence of a Deity or because they’ve somehow reconciled the idea of a loving God with the fact of Evil.  No. Being religious is simply in their DNA.  \r\n\r\nMetaphysics interested me when I was a teenager.  I had a dim idea that Great Minds wrestled with such things and that, if I were to have a Great Mind, I was obliged to join in.  You are older now than I was then; you know what follows:  feverish disputation, resentment and alienation.  These might be endured if there was any hope of a rational resolution to the Great Questions, but eventually I concluded that there was no such hope and grew weary of the whole business.  I set it all aside and found, to my surprise, that I remained quite religious, regardless of the irrationality of it.  I have been at peace with my own appetite for religion, ever since.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t need to make sense.  If it’s absurd, fine.  I inherited the religious gene, apparently, along with brown eyes, musical ability and a bundle of other traits.  And that’s that.  I couldn’t be non-religious any more than I could change my eye-color to blue or turn tone-deaf.  It’s who I am.\r\n\r\nMy dear wife, my partner and best friend, the love of my life for nearly 50 years, hasn’t the slightest appetite for religion.  It does not run in her family.  I go to church every Sunday.  Jo stays home, watching “Meet the Press.”   I pray and ponder, many times, every day.  If Jo prays or ponders the Will of God, she has never made it known to me.  \r\n\r\nOur daughter seems to have inherited the gene from my side, while our son is like his Mama, non-religious.  Happily, the non-religious half of our little family gets along just fine with the religious half.  It’s no big deal.  We like each other and religion rarely comes up.  When it does, we’re respectful.  We tilt our heads and listen thoughtfully. When I give thanks before a family meal, all four heads are bowed.  We have lots of other things to talk about and most of them are more fun than religion.\r\n\r\nI’ve written quite a lot of sacred choral music, ie., music intended to be sung in worship services.  Religious feeling sometimes finds its way into my instrumental works as well.\r\n\r\nToday being Easter, I’m inviting you to listen to the second movement of my Sonata for cello and piano, entitled “Largo Religioso.”  I think you will like it, whatever your DNA, “religiously-wise-speaking” (as the great musical humorist Peter Schickele would say). You don’t need to have inherited the religious gene to enjoy this music.  I know that’s so because my Jo loves this recording!\r\n\r\nJo, and shortly you, are among the very few who have heard this music.  I wrote the sonata in 1990 for my cellist friend and mentor Terry King but it has rarely been performed.  I have never heard it performed live.  It has only recently been recorded and will be featured on a CD of cello works which I hope to issue next year.\r\n\r\nTo hear my friends — cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Sam Black — playing “Largo Religioso,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 27, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nI want to give you a ‘sneak peek’ into a new CD of my music, due out next year.  The CD will be titled “Seasonal Breezes” and will offer premiere recordings of several of my cello works played by a superb cellist, my friend Josh Aerie.\r\n\r\nToday, you’ll be almost the first to hear one of the tracks.\r\n\r\nThe central work on the CD will be my Sonata for Cello and Piano, a deeply felt work I wrote in 1990 for another superb cellist, my friend and mentor, Terry King.  \r\n\r\n1990?  The CD coming out in 2018?  That’s 28 years!  It takes a long time to get a piece recorded and issued on a CD.  Everything happens slowly in the world of classical music.\r\n\r\nI have waited until this weekend, just prior to September 11 with its tragic connotations, to share this deeply felt music with you.\r\n\r\nTwice now, I’ve termed this music “deeply felt."\r\n\r\nWhat is meant when we say music is “deeply felt.”  To whose deep feelings do we refer?   In whose psyche do those profound, unsettling feelings reside?  Whose tragedy is experienced when tragic music is played and heard?  Who is experiencing it?\r\n\r\nThe musicians?  No.  If the musicians permit themselves to experience the full extent of the sadness that is evoked when they play deeply sorrowful music, they would be reduced to weeping, rendering themselves unable to perform.  Musicians, when performing, are not at liberty to be overwhelmed by their emotions.  They have a job to do, a technically demanding job that requires intense concentration.\r\n\r\nThe composer?  No.  The composer’s task is even more demanding, technically, than the musicians’.  Tremendous concentration is required.  I do not feel sorrowful when I write sorrowful music, nor joyful when I write joyful music.  The emotions I’ve experienced while writing music are mostly anxiety and fear.  More on that in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe listeners?  Yes.  The majestic sorrow in majestically sorrowful music is yours; it evokes your sense of the tragic, your sorrow in contemplating the losses you’ve suffered, the thought of your own departure, the attendant loss it will bring to the people whom you love and who love you.  At the moment of performance and perception, those feelings are neither the musicians'' nor the composer’s.  Those feelings are yours.\r\n\r\nUnderstand from this assertion how important you are as a listener; understand that you are crucial to the experience of music.  Unheard music is as meaningless as a painting that never gets painted, a book that never gets written.\r\n\r\nNon-composers are curious about the feelings of composers.  A friend asked me, "What does it feel like, what emotions do you have, when you are composing?”\r\n\r\nWe can be honest with a friend.  I ventured an honest answer.  My emotions when writing music are:  initial excitement, soon followed by an irksome anxiety and growing fear, leading to a mingling of regret and tentative delight, finally arriving at relief.  \r\n\r\nI am unaware of any other composer who may have tried to explain what I mean.  So instead of quoting another composer, by way of explanation, I will quote two great writers.\r\n\r\nThis from Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary.”  \r\n\r\n	“Human speech is like a cracked kettle on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.”\r\n\r\nAnd this from Virginia Woolf''s "To the Lighthouse.” \r\n\r\n	"She could see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment’s flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.  Such she often felt herself—struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to say:  “But this is what I see; this is what I see,” and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast … "\r\n\r\nThese writers know.  Note the phrase, “as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.” \r\n\r\nIn creating music, what I have feared is that, once again, I will ‘blow’ it, I will compromise.  I am afraid that as what I was trying to capture slips away from what I envisioned, from what I aspired to, I will deceive myself, pretending that I am satisfied or, worse, that I will convince myself that no one will notice the compromises I make, the many passages which I settled for less.  I have sometimes found myself literally holding my breath in fear as I plunked ahead on the piano, scratching the notes onto score paper or keyboarding the notation on my computer.  \r\n\r\nYears after a piece is finished, when I hear it, I can still spot the places where I caved.  I curse myself for those flaws.  Damn!  I came so close!  If only I had tried harder!\r\n\r\nNo musical ideas come to reality without being diminished in the process by a great many compromises.  The finished work always falls short of the hopes I cherished for it when I commenced to write it down.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing can overcome the paralyzing effect of all this fear:  the conviction that the idea is GREAT, that it MUST be to brought to reality, that it is divinely inspired will of God, that it expresses and extends the trajectory of the human race, that it affords an invaluable glimpse ahead into what my painter friend Sean Sexton calls “nextwhere,” that the existence of this new work will extend consciousness, change lives, change the world, will fulfill the purpose of music that Schubert proclaimed when he said that the reason he composed music was “to improve Reality."\r\n\r\nTo move forward in spite of fear requires a very strong ego, strong enough to have sufficient faith in the importance of one’s own ideas, even though we know that, in the greater scheme of things, the value of our ideas is scant, that “a hundred years from now, what will be the difference?”  Our precious ideas will have been forgotten.  This is easily proven.  How much music that was written by American classical composers a hundred years AGO — that is, in the year 1917 — is remembered today?  \r\n\r\nPeople say that artists are egotistical.  Of COURSE they are.  Artists MUST be egotistical to muster the gumption to create anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the piece is finished, the struggle over, I feel regret that it didn’t turn out as well as I’d hoped, delight that it turned out as well as it did, and relief that, for better or worse, I know that I did the best I could and completed the task.\r\n\r\nMuch of the above described emotional journey parallels the emotional content of the first movement of my cello sonata, the music that’s waiting for you to discover today.  The excitement is there, the anxiety and fear, the delight in moments of beauty and a certain majesty.  \r\n\r\nYou may find your own sorrows and joys reflected in it as well.  May your hearing of it  comfort you on this weekend of the remembrance of the events of September 11.\r\n\r\nTo hear my friends cellist Josh Aerie and pianist Sam Black playing the first movement of my Sonata for Cello and Piano -- so beautifully! — click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),78);

He performed with “les Gavottes”, the Riviera-based trio that recorded my first three trios for clarinet, cello and piano, written specifically for the group. \r\n\r\nI sent Jean my works for solo keyboard, including “Pensée," the earliest piece of my music which I still value, written in 1968, when I was 18 years old.  \r\n\r\nToday, what is surprises me about this little piece is the extent to which it shows that I was already so completely myself when I wrote it.  When you listen, I think you’ll agree.  You’ll think, “Yes, this sounds like something R.S. would write."\r\n\r\nMy high school music teachers taught me 90% of what I needed to know about music in order to do my life’s work.  During my college years I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a middle ground between who I really was, musically, and the composer the faculty at the illustrious School of Music I attended seemed to want me to be.  The implication was that if I didn’t cave in and write avant garde music, I could not have a career.  But I was not cut out to be an avant garde composer.  Musically, I was always a Conservative.  “Derrière garde,” yes.  Avant garde, no.\r\n\r\nHappily, after graduating, I recovered my authentic voice.   \r\n\r\nI named this piece “Pensée” because it means “a thought” in French.  This is humorous because, at that time, my relationship with the French language had been a disaster.  At the time I wrote the piece, I had had one year of high school French and had bombed badly, earning the only “D” of my academic career.  I was too busy writing music and fiction to bother learning French.\r\n\r\nAll the same, teenager that I was, I thought the title “Pensée” would sound intelligent, worldly and high-falutin’.  When I was 18 I never dreamed I would soon return to studying French again — with seriousness this time -- let alone that I would someday  teach French (as I have been doing very happily for the past two years).\r\n\r\nYet the title is apt.  This IS a thoughtful piece.  Especially the way Jean Tatu plays it.  His rendering is tender and simple.   I love to watch him play in the Youtube he kindly sent me, especially the way he lifts his hands from the keyboard after sounding the last chord.  It reminds me that music-making is a thing we can relish visually as well as aurally.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(50,replace(replace('Our son, Chapman, 31, is my favorite guy.  On his Facebook page, he advises his friends:  “Be an interesting Cincinnatian” and he practices what he preaches.  An extraordinarily versatile trombonist, he has made numerous tours of America and Europe with a variety of bands.  Here in Cincinnati, he’s the co-founder of the Hot Magnolias, the Queen City’s chief exponent of traditional New Orleans jazz.  But he also plays with several other bands, ''local and beyond,’ in styles ranging through reggae, ska, rockabilly, Dixieland, soul and funk.  He’s making his fourth European tour next month as a guest trombonist with The Toasters, a famous ska band.\r\n\r\nHe’s written only a few songs, but they are strong.  The Blues song he wrote and played at my mother-in-law’s funeral brought tears to our eyes.  His ska tune is entitled “Higher Ground” and was recorded by another band he helped to found, The Pinstripes.  I liked the opening tune of “Higher Ground" so much that I made it the recurring theme in the joyful, exuberant "Finale" movement of my cello concerto.  I want to share that movement with you today.\r\n\r\nAt the website linked above, you’ll hear Chap''s tune immediately, catchy and compelling, played by the brass.  Take in at least the first thirty seconds so that when you listen to the “Finale" concerto movement, posted below, you’ll see how it was adapted.  Click on the link to hear The Pinstripes playing Chap’s tune, “Higher Ground.”\r\n\r\nSince the tune is the style of ska, the tempo of the “Finale" movement of my concerto is indicated as "Tempo di ska.”  The opening three measures establish the beat, the key and the feel.  Then the solo cello renders Chap’s tune, somewhat as you heard it in “Higher Ground.”  The same, yet not the same.\r\n\r\nNext, right quick, the clarinet plays tune as a trickster might, ornamented and sassy, an octave higher than the cello you just heard and with jazz and Klezmer inflections.\r\n\r\nThus, the clarinet immediately establishes itself as a rival to the cello.  It’s a theatrical device.  Sometimes the clarinet steals the spotlight from the solo cello.  At other times the clarinet supports the cello’s solo role.  At still other times the clarinet retreats, a pale color amid the strings.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a metaphor.  The clarinet is the piece’s only wind instrument and the only black instrument in the ensemble.  All the other instruments are the color of varnished wood.  The clarinet is the outsider — or is he?  It’s as if the clarinet is the black man in a white society or a Jew in Christendom.  What is the difference between merely being present and truly belonging?  What does it mean to belong?  Having one’s contributions accepted and appreciated by the majority?\r\n\r\nConsider that ska was created by Jamaicans, jazz and the blues by African-Americans and Klezmer by Jews.  And here is our clarinet friend, in this concerto, evoking ska, jazz and Klezmer.  See what’s happening?  But, here, in this work, the clarinet is not an outsider, not a “black sheep,” because in this work those ‘outsider’ minority musical traditions are reconciled with classical European traditions. \r\n\r\nHow?  At 2:15 the music abruptly, unexpectedly turns 18th-century, Viennese.  With almost no modulation, there are improbable changes:  to a new key -- G minor — and a new meter -- 6/8.  We’ve visited this world many times before.  It brings images to mind  musicians in frock coats, knee stockings and powdered wigs, a polite and ordered society.  It’s the world of Haydn.   \r\n\r\nWhat happened to Chap’s ska tune?  It’s still there but hidden, played pizzicato in the lower register by the cellos and basses.    \r\n\r\nBut the main action here constitutes an homage to Haydn.  Why Haydn?.  Because he so effectively reconciled humor with nobility and surprise with architectural integrity.   That’s what I’m trying to do in this concerto.  The Haydn-esque section is both an homage and a joke but I don’t think Papa Haydn would be offended;  no one loved a musical joke better than he.\r\n\r\nAbout 3:24 the music picks up speed and starts to cook again.  By 3:41 it’s really goin’ to town and sounds, to me, like a hit song from one of George M. Cohan’s old-fashioned Broadway musicals.\r\n\r\nThe tunes are developed and expanded and at 5:19 comes the movement’s climax, when the cello descends from a high A and lands in the unanticipated key of Eb major. This new key is the extreme opposite of A major, the key in which the movement and the entire concerto are cast.  \r\n\r\nThis brief venture into Eb major reconciles the opposing extremes of the circle of fifths, echoing the reconciliation of musical styles and traditions that is attempted throughout.  The chugging 16th-notes in the strings in this section always prompt me to imagine a little locomotive, flying down the tracks.  For me, this section recalls the fun and silliness of Leroy Anderson’s wonderful little tone poems.  You might call it “The Little Engine Who Could."\r\n\r\nBut the piece doesn’t end there.  The moment for a big cello cadenza is prepared but the cellist abandons the attempt, playing instead a sort of “anti-cadenza.”  Instead of a flashy virtuoso display, the cello simply plays a little figure on the A string with the open D string sounding underneath.  The figure is short and it gets shorter each time the cellist repeats it, gradually releasing the energy that had nearly reached the bursting point; after our little locomotive just about burst its boiler, this "anti-cadenza" gradually lets the pressure escape.\r\n\r\nNow comes one last quiet surprise:  the tenderness of the cello.  Using its delicate middle strings, the cello plays a plagal cadence, like the “Amen” at the end of a hymn, returning at last to the solemn, heartfelt hymnody that began the opening movement, twenty minutes earlier.  The cello affirms:  "Joyfulness can be funny, yes, even rambunctious … but also, at the end of the day, joyfulness comes in response to the Sacred."  \r\n\r\nAll the opposites presented in the work -- opposites of mood, style, key, genre, the clash of the solo cello and his rival, the clarinet -- are reconciled at last and the concerto ends in quiet dignity.\r\n\r\nTo hear the final movement of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 24, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAfter several years of gentle pestering, the Bulgarian-American cellist Kalin Ivanov finally convinced me, by dangling the prospect of a premiere performance in Carnegie Hall, to write a concerto for him.  True to his word, he premiered the work in Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall and he has performed the piece many times since.\r\n\r\nHe recently sent me a marvelous recording of his performance with the Las Colinas Symphony, a Dallas-area orchestra.  I’m eager for you to hear all four movements, but .  let’s listen to the first movement today.\r\n\r\nKalin and I talked at length about the piece before any notes were written down.  We agreed it should be tuneful, tonal, accessible.  Born in Bulgaria, now a new American citizen, Kalin wanted a piece that would bridge the two cultures, combining European and American musical gestures.\r\n\r\nWhat is more American-sounding than a folk hymn?  The concerto begins quietly, with the cello playing an original folk hymn, all the way through, all by himself.  Then the clarinet plays it, the cello in canon right behind, with the strings plucking a tentative accompaniment.  Eight minutes later, after a tumble of fugues, the hymn returns at the end of the movement, played in rich harmonies by the entire ensemble.\r\n\r\nWhat is more European-sounding than a fugue?   Between the opening statements of the hymn and the return of the hymn at the end, come two fugues, both derived from the second line of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.”  The subject is derived from the notes we sing with the words, “Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack.”  It’s disguised a bit, so listen carefully at 2:02 and see if you can spot that fragment.  The fugues climax at 6:20 with a quotation of the ending of that beloved song:  “For it’s one, two, three strikes you’re out at the old ball game.”  it’s slightly altered and it goes by quickly.  So listen carefully!\r\n\r\nI remember my grandmother Kate Hoff, my Nana, singing that song with gusto … and she and my grandfather were both born in Serbia, not far from Bulgaria.  Arriving in Ohio as immigrant children, they were intensely proud to be Americans, eager to embrace the culture of their adopted homeland, a homeland that, they felt, had adopted them.  Remembering this, I am pained by the anti-immigrant rhetoric we hear so often today.  My experience of immigrants is personal; I think of my grandparents and what they brought to this country.\r\n\r\nIn between the two fugues, at 5:30, comes another folk hymn, contrasting with the opening one, and very sweet.  The fugues end with the cello’s cadenza, a bridge back to the hymn tune that began the movement.\r\n\r\nYou’ll notice that the clarinetist is the cellist’s rival, competing for the spotlight usually reserved, exclusively, for the concerto''s soloist.  This is yet another metaphor.  The clarinet is the outsider, a minority of one, a wind instrument, dull black with silver keys, while all the other instruments are made of strings and shining, varnished wood.  Like any minority worth its salt, the clarinet brings richness, color and diversity to the whole.\r\n\r\nThe movement is entitled “Hymns and Fugues.”  It juxtaposes and, for me at least, reconciles the very different musical gestures of the American and European traditions.\r\n\r\nTo hear the opening movement of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of a cello/clarinet/piano reduction of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nFeb. 21, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nAwhile back, when I was railing against the term “classical music,” one of you kindly replied to suggest I should instead use the word “classycal."\r\n\r\nI like the coined word “classycal” even though it’s too cute for practical purposes.  I like the flippant hint of caution against trying too hard to be “classy.”  I like the gentle mockery of the term “classical”, which, like “fine arts," could do with a bit of gentle mocking.\r\n\r\nWhich in turn reminds me of the humorous, wise quip attributed to Fats Waller:\r\n\r\n“Some people got more class than what’s good for ‘em,” Fats said, "but the rest ain’t got no class at all.”\r\n\r\nAll told, I’d rather be among those in the former category.\r\n\r\nFats was black.  Me, I’m a white guy.  I like plain yogurt, Basmati rice and mayonnaise.  I put miniature marshmallows on top of my Cream of Wheat.  That is something that white people do.  (I’m joking, just so you know.)\r\n\r\nI have a deep admiration for what African-Americans have achieved, musically and otherwise.  In our shared American history, Louis Armstrong is among the Americans I most admire.  An America devoid of the cultural contributions of African-Americans would be vastly diminished, unimaginable.\r\n\r\nGershwin knew this and it inspired him to write the greatest and most frequently performed American opera, “Porgy and Bess,” which begins with “Summertime,” one of Gershwin’s greatest tunes.\r\n\r\nThat opera is an ardent homage to African-American culture.\r\n\r\nMy own efforts to do the same don’t amount to much, not alongside those of Gershwin.  But my attempts are no less sincere.  \r\n\r\nVaughan Williams put it so well:  “There can only be a few great composers, but there can be many sincere composers."\r\n\r\nTo hear one of my own homages to African-American culture, listen to the second movement, “Blues," of my Concerto for Cello with Strings & Clarinet, performed by cellist Kalin Ivanov, clarinetist Jonathan Jones and the strings of the Las Colinas Symphony Orchestra under Maciej Zoltowski, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 9, 2017\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),135);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(51,replace(replace('How does a painter know when a painting is finished?  How does a writer know that this is the final draft?  How does a composer know that further tinkering will not improve the piece?\r\n\r\nFascinating questions, the answers to which, including the one I am about to venture, ought to be taken with a grain of salt.  Maybe two. \r\n\r\nBecause … the only experience of Life we have is our own.  Each of us is an island, notwithstanding John Donne’s assertion to the contrary, and we draw our conclusions from what has passed in the tiny island-worlds we inhabit.  We are all Robinson Crusoe; that is why we still read that book, almost 300 years after it was written.  I’ve read it three times.\r\n\r\nVast gulfs separate us.  We are profoundly different from one another.  \r\n\r\nWhen some loud mouth announces that “Deep down we are all the same,” it’s because he wants to sell us something:  a product, a faith, a political allegiance.  How dare such loud mouths presume to know what we are like, deep down?  \r\n\r\nEach of our stories is unique.  The wonder is that we can communicate at all.  Every painting, story and piece of music is a message in a bottle, tossed from another island, washed up on our shore.\r\n\r\nThus, I can only guess how other artists might sense when a work is complete.  \r\n\r\nBut I can tell you authoritatively how I know when my own work is done.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I started, as a boy, “making up stuff” — stories, tunes, ideas — I have partnered with what I can best describe as a voice.  As I worked on creative projects, this voice speaks to me, almost audibly, saying, “Try an F sharp here, delay the punch line there, put in another measure before the climax, add a pinch of dissonance, make it spookier, make it funnier, smooth it out, give that tune to the cello, this part is too obvious, too pat.”  \r\n\r\nI rarely resisted, almost always tried and accepted what was suggested. When I ignored this free advice, the forward momentum of my piece or story would flounder.  The voice reminds me that a piece of music or writing, as it is being newly born, knows where it wants to go.  My task has been to learn to let it go there, to stay out of the way.\r\n\r\nTake these weekly missives you kindly allow me to share.  (Thank you!  I am immensely grateful for the privilege of sharing my life’s work in this way.)  I slap out a rough draft and then re-read and re-write, dozens of times, implementing suggestions from you-know-what.  Yep, that same voice.\r\n\r\nAs I bring to reality a piece of music or writing, the voice makes fewer and fewer suggestions.  When the voice falls silent, when there are no more suggestions, that’s when I know the work is done.  Just now I re-read this message for the last time … and the only peep of advice that came was to add this sentence I am now writing.  \r\n\r\nln my childhood, teens and twenties, I never thought about the source of this voice.  I took it for granted.  In my thirties, reading about Carl Jung’s thoughts on these matters, I began to understand my experience in a new way.\r\n\r\nIn creative work, at least in mine, there is an extra-human influence, coming from outside my conscious mind, to which no suitable name can be given because the old name has been soiled by so much ignoble use.  It is the very thing — that other-, extra-, beyond- thing which I have tentatively termed ‘a voice'' -- with which we partner and work.  And, yes, it is the thing we worship, each in our way, implicitly or devoutly, as suits our tastes. \r\n\r\nI felt a peculiar relief, a curious unclenching, when I found this same thought, beautifully expressed, in Odell Shepard’s thoughtful memoir, The Cabin Down the Glen:\r\n\r\n"There is some Power ... that stands waiting to help, to cheer, and to guide us.  I do not care to name it now, for all names are limitations, but I believe that each of the great worships of the world has been addressed to this Power, has been the rediscovery by some direct and penetrative mind of a truth that all right-living people have always dimly known.  When we work against this Power, we fail.  When we try to work without it, we merely exhaust ourselves.  When we work with it, we succeed and fulfill our destiny."\r\n\r\nWhen I set out to write “Sunny Days,“ my first trio for violin, clarinet and piano, I planned a five-movement work; the third was to be a set of variations on a Belo-Russian folksong.  But as I worked on that movement the voice''s suggestions came in a flood and, though I tried to keep the movement concise, it grew longer and longer.  Soon, it was almost as long as the other four movements combined and still the suggestions kept coming.\r\n\r\nFinally, I accepted the inevitable:  this movement was determined, perhaps predestined, to become a separate work, “an island, entire of itself,” to quote Mr. Donne.  \r\n\r\nSo I cast it loose from “Sunny Days” and let it expand even further until it became my Trio #2 for violin, clarinet and piano, a single 15-minute movement, subtitled, "American Variations on Belo-Russian Folksong.” \r\n\r\nTo hear the Verdehr Trio’s exuberant performance, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 22, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),32);
INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(52,replace(replace('In the Impressionists Gallery of the Cincinnati Art Museum, where I was as a museum guard for eight years, there are two paintings by Alfred Sisley and one by Frédéric Bazille.\r\n\r\nThe Sisleys are tranquil landscapes, a river in the foreground, a village half-way back, a joyful sky rendered in shades of pale green, pink, lavender, cream and dusty blue.\r\n\r\nSisley must have loved “inventing” the sky.  Consider.  As he painted, outdoors, the river and village just sat there before him, unchanging, in no hurry to be captured in paint. But the skies were always changing, leaving him at liberty to devise whatever sky he wanted to fashion above his quiet river and his sleeping village.  He indulged his fancy and concocted some of the most joyful skies ever seen on canvas, at least by the undersigned.\r\n\r\nThe CAM’s painting by Bazille is mysterious and unfinished, like Bazille himself.  A woman sits on a bench at the edge of a garden; a beckoning path recedes into a surprising depth, suggesting undeveloped potential, an unknowable future, a journey only contemplated, never undertaken.  \r\n\r\nThe woman and the bench are transparent; mere outlines; you can see right through them to the garden behind.  Is the painting unfinished or did Bazille intend to indicate only the outline of the woman?  Is she a ghost?\r\n\r\nBazille’s story doesn’t answer these questions; it certainly enriches them.  A painter of great talent, close friends with Monet, Renoir, Sisley, he was killed at the age of 28, heroically leading a charge in the Franco-Prussian War.  \r\n\r\nWhen he painted that strange garden scene he didn’t know that his life would soon be cut short.  When we look at it today, we cannot help imagining that the beckoning path is emblematic of the future he might have pursued, the potential he might have realized; the ghostly figure is perhaps the partner with whom he might have found a lasting fulfillment.\r\n\r\nFor me, despite the garden''s rich greens and robustly colorful flowers, it’s a sad painting, a lament for all the young talents taken away too soon by War and for the veterans who returned but who had lost their way and were never the same.  My father, for one.  \r\n\r\nThe last movement of my Impressionist Suite #2 for reed trio is entitled “Sisley & Bazille: Joyful Skies and a Lament for the Fallen.”\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear Sisley’s joyful skies right off, the closest I could get, musically, to what Sisley expressed so cheerfully in paint.   Exactly two minutes in, the mood shifts from joyful to sad as I try, beginning at 2:30, to put into notes the sense of loss we feel, standing before a soldier''s grave.\r\n\r\nAt 4:15, we lift our eyes from the grave and there, again, is the sky.  Sisley’s sky.  So happy after all, smiling down on us.  And, through our tears, we smile back, in spite of everything.\r\n\r\nTo hear this movement played — perfectly! beautifully! -- by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 29, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nImagine this New Year as a baby posed on its mother’s lap in a painting by Mary Cassatt.\r\n\r\nWhat music for such a moment?  A lullaby, of course.\r\n\r\nInfants need sleep.  We all do, especially these days.  Waking hours are tense and, come night, sleep can be elusive.  A lullaby says, “Sleep.”\r\n\r\nWhen hit the sack I am calmed by thinking about this:  from now on, Cincinnati’s toddlers will be guaranteed a pre-school education thanks to our citizenry having voted to increase our property taxes to pay for it.  \r\n\r\nAmong American cities, Cincinnati has the second-highest rate of childhood poverty.  Last November 8 we did something to turn around that shameful statistic.  We were told that a strong pre-school experience wings the impoverished child upward; the child’s trajectory into the future is aimed higher.  We were told that when positive patterns of learning and social behavior are established early on, the children harvest much more in subsequent school years, preparing them for an ascendant life.   A majority of Cincinnatians saw the sense of these assertions and voted accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am so happy about this, so proud of our city.  We did something unselfish, purely because it was the right thing to do.  We set aside conservative self-interest, the usual knee-jerk antipathy to higher taxes, and we did something great.\r\n\r\nGood for us!  \r\n\r\nIt’s one of the many phenomena that fall well below the national news radar, the sort of thing a friend had in mind when she wrote to say that, despite recent events, she remains "at least somewhat hopeful that we’ll be pulled through by the many people of this country who contribute to their communities each day in quiet ways."\r\n\r\nCan individuals or communities or even large-scale movements slow the devastation that is in store for our state, our country and the world?  The rich and powerful are surely laughing at the prospect of whatever resistance we might muster.  \r\n\r\nFor example, our governor just signed into law a bill forbidding any Ohio municipality the liberty to raise the minimum wage.  Does our state have the power to do that?  Apparently so.  Why would our lawmakers impose such a restriction?  Mask it how they will, it’s only to keep the rich rich, the poor poor and themselves in power.\r\n\r\nStill, if only for the sake of our mental health, we must try to ameliorate new laws like that one (and the far worse national and global catastrophes soon to come) by doing a little good, in a small way, close to home.  It is an alternative to despair, to hugging our belongings while things crumble.\r\n\r\nArtists are particularly powerless before political onslaughts.  Clout-less, they cannot sway.  Wealth-less, they cannot bribe with campaign contributions.  Like any citizen, an artist can protest;  I have done my share of protesting and will soon do plenty more.  \r\n\r\nMainly, artists just do their work, though it rarely makes much sense as a response to the current events of their time.  \r\n\r\nMary Cassatt’s quiet depictions of mothers and infants did nothing to avert the horrors of the century that followed.  The little lullaby I wrote in homage to Miss Cassatt won’t have any effect either.  \r\n\r\nNo mere work of art will swerve the attacks on the vulnerable that are slated to commence in precisely twenty days, nor the concomitant showering of benefits on the most well-off at the expense of tens of millions.  What melody could protect the health of our countrymen or the well-being of our environment?  What tune could put uncorked hatreds back in the bottle?  What song could forestall the coming wars?   \r\n\r\nWars?  He said: “I love war.”  Other people’s children will die, not his.\r\n\r\nStill, listening to my Lullaby, my homage to Cassatt, you might find respite, a temporary unclenching, a beneficial calm, a kind of wakeful sleep.  \r\n\r\nIt may be scant comfort, considering what is coming, but it’s what one artist has to offer.\r\n\r\nTo hear a tender rendering of Mary Cassatt''s lullaby movement from my Impressionist Suite #2, played by oboist Mark Ostoich, clarinetist Ron Aufmann and bassoonist Mark Ortwein, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJanuary 1, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne day when I was at my post as a guard at the Cincinnati Art Museum, a solid woman approached me with a purposeful stride.\r\n\r\n“Where’s the ART?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Ma’am, you’re in the Asian gallery.  This is where we display the art of Asia.”\r\n\r\n“This is flea market stuff,” she said.  “I wanna see some Art.”\r\n\r\n“You mean paintings?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, that’s right.  Paintings.  Statues.  In other words, Art.”\r\n\r\nHoo boy.\r\n\r\nThat job expanded my horizons.\r\n\r\nDid you know that some museum-goers attach their depreciated chewing gum to furniture, the undersides of drinking fountains and even onto the frames of paintings?\r\n\r\nDid you know that they leave coins on the carved hands, arms, feet and garments of sculptures?\r\n\r\nDid you know they yank open the drawers of Louis XVI-era armoires?  and are at a loss to know what to do when their children climb onto a hand-carved, Victorian-era bedstead?\r\n\r\nNeither did I.\r\n\r\nOne lady, perusing the descriptive paragraph posted alongside a painting, mistook the identification number for a price tag.  “You paid this much for this painting?” she snorted.  “There goes our tax dollars, down the drain, as per usual.”  I assured her that the support the museum enjoyed was entirely private and voluntary.  She gave me a look.\r\n\r\nA man asked me to tell him how to find the nearest restroom.  I did.  Less than a minute later he came marching back with a menacing air.  “You messin’ with me?” he said.  I assured him that had not been my intention.  Abandoning my post, I led him to the restroom.\r\n\r\nA woman sidled up to me and, in hushed tones, said, “Now these are all copies, right?  I mean, they’re not the actual paintings.”\r\n\r\nI assured her that all the art on display was genuine.\r\n\r\n“Oh come on.  Some of these have to be copies.”\r\n\r\nI repeated my assurance.\r\n\r\n“Look,” she said, a little louder.  "This is an art museum, right?  Which means that, somewhere in here, you gotta have the Mona Lisa.  Now it’s gotta be a copy, right?  I mean, you’re not going to tell me that you have the actual Mona Lisa here.”\r\n\r\n“No, Ma’am, I wouldn’t tell you that.”\r\n\r\n“Well then!” she huffed, vindicated, stomping off.\r\n\r\nA family stood before a depiction of St. Sebastian dying, shot full of arrows.  “Look kids,” said the father, solemnly pointing to the painting.  “It’s George Armstrong Custer!"\r\n\r\nAfter seating her tour group of First Graders on the floor at her feet, a docent positioned herself beside Robert Blum’s painting, “The Silk Merchant,” and asked, “Who can tell me where silk comes from?”\r\n\r\nOne little girl waved her hand.  The docent nodded at her.  “It comes from SHEEP!” the girl cried, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“No, sweetheart,” said the docent.  “You’re thinking of COTTON!”\r\n\r\n??\r\n\r\nSuch moments provide the museum guard with an opportunity to practice spiritual discipline, struggling to refrain from rolling his eyeballs or bursting out in laughter.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the guard is surrounded by patient mentors;  to wit, the paintings, silently staring down from the walls.  Dignified, passive, handsome, they have endured human folly, some for centuries.  \r\n\r\nConsider the works of Gustave Caillebotte.  He is the least remembered of the original French Impressionists, perhaps because he valued clarity, precision and muted tones while the rest were busy capturing light with hastily applied brush-strokes and the colors so enjoyed by cherishers of jelly beans.  \r\n\r\nI wrote two suites for reed trio, trying to depict the spirit and character of seven of those painters.\r\n   \r\nThe second movement from my Impressionist Suite #2 evokes the style of Monsieur Caillebotte.

You can listen to music while you are falling asleep but once you’re really asleep, you’re not listening to music anymore!\r\n\r\nWhat other art form does this?  Imagine a poet writing stanzas with the explicit intention of making your eye lids grow heavier and heavier as you read them.  Or a painter wishing to create canvases that elicit somnolence to such an extent that couches, cots and bedsteads must be set up in the galleries where they are exhibited, bedecked with comforters and pillows.  Or a play that deliberately sets out to induce its audience to snore by intermission.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there are boring poems, paintings and plays; none were written with the specific intention of assisting readers, viewers or theatre goers in falling asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen my brothers and I were tiny, grandmother sang us to sleep with a little tune of her own making.  The words were simply, “Doo-lee, doo-lee, doo-lee….” repeated for as long as was needed to dispatch us to the Land of Nod.\r\n\r\nWhen my turn came to sing lullabyes to my own little ones, I sang that tune again, along with “Loch Lomond” and two Shaker folk hymns: “Simple Gifts” and “Love is Little.”\r\n\r\nThe better known lullabyes didn’t serve.  Brahms’ Lullaby is beautiful but it’s a piano piece, not really intended to be sung.  \r\n\r\n“Rock-a-bye Baby” has a lovely tune, but the imagery is troubling.  You don’t think about the lyrics until you are actually singing them to a baby.  If you looked out your kitchen window and saw a neighbor placing an occupied cradle in a treetop, you’d call the police; they would arrest the caregiver on a charge of child endangerment.  Such a stunt would be dangerous on a still day, but the song says that the wind is blowing, or soon will be!   That bough?  It is going to break; the lyrics leave no room for doubt.  The song doesn’t say “if the bough breaks.”  No.  It is quite clear on that point.  It says “when the bough breaks.”  Folks, that cradle is destined to take the plunge.  “Down will come baby, cradle and all.”  This is a lullaby?  Are you kidding me?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the tune belies all this, rendering the images tongue-in-cheek, even dreamlike.  A good tune can do that, working a sea-change on the lyrics.  The treetop seems hazy, like foliage rendered by Monet.  The wind ineffably gentle.  The baby’s predestined descent will take place, we feel assured, in slo-mo, very slo-mo.  Gravity notwithstanding, we know that the baby will be perfectly safe.\r\n \r\nIn 2002, my graphic artist friends Randy and Michelle Wright asked me to write a lullaby for their newborn daughter, Kara.  If you have my CDs, you’ve seen Randy’s work; he designs my CDs and also my books.  \r\n\r\nA lover of the cello, Rand asked that the piece be scored for cello and piano.  Interestingly, a few nights after I received this request, as I was falling asleep, a lullaby-like tune came to me.  It was still in my head the next morning so I used it as the opening melody of the piece.  \r\n\r\nIt’s followed by a contrasting middle section, beginning at 2:40, evoking the sleepy Old South as imagined by Yankees like myself, who have seen "Gone With The Wind” a time or two.   The Antebellum South, when life was slow and easy, at least for the aristocrats, as always.  And sleep was deep.  That’s the fantasy; let us suspend our revisionist impulses for a bit and honor it for what it is:  a fantasy, yes, but a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nRandy and Michelle, with little Kara in tow, were present when the piece was premiered.  She crooned and chortled as the piece was played before an otherwise silent audience.  Her contribution was the perfect, non-musical touch and the audience loved it.\r\n\r\nTo hear cellist Jeff Schoyen and pianist Phil Amalong perform "Lullabye for Kara,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 4, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),84);

For one, she made us memorize poems, something I had never done.  One was this poem by Lord Byron, all about youthful arrogance, impetuosity and love:\r\n\r\nStanzas Written on the Road Between Florence and Pisa\r\n\r\nOh, talk not to me of a name great in story;\r\nThe days of our youth are the days of our glory;\r\nAnd the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty\r\nAre worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.\r\n\r\nWhat are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?\r\n''Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:\r\nThen away with all such from the head that is hoary!\r\nWhat care I for the wreaths that can only give glory?\r\n\r\nO Fame! -if I e''er took delight in thy praises,\r\n''Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,\r\nThan to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover\r\nShe thought that I was not unworthy to love her.\r\n\r\nThere chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;\r\nHer glance was the best of the rays that surround thee;\r\nWhen it sparkled o''er aught that was bright in my story,\r\nI knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.\r\n\r\nMemorizing those stanzas was a steep climb for a kid growing up in rural north central Ohio, but there was no getting around it.  I nailed it and can recite it to this day, fifty years later.  Now that I have a “brow that is wrinkled,” not to mention a “head that is hoary,” I view the poem differently than I did when I was 17.  When I recite it to myself, I think, “Heck.  Lord Byron was dead at 36.  What did he know about wrinkles?  Diddley-squat."\r\n\r\nI’ve memorized quite a few poems.  After I have a poem in my head, it sometimes begins to “sing.”  Before I know it, I’m setting it to music.\r\n\r\nWhen I set Lord Byron’s poem to music, in 1977, I tried to capture its high Romanticism, galloping rhythm and breathless, forward-plunging speed.

The cycle tells a sad, beautiful love story.  Sad story, beautiful music.\r\n\r\nA lonely clarinet solo opens the piece with a tender love theme.  You might recognize it because I later expanded it into another work, “The View from Carew,” which is both a single-movement chamber work for clarinet, cello and piano and also the middle movement of my concerto for clarinet and orchestra.  One of my best themes, it is played by all three instruments at various times throughout “Along the River,” though it never appears in the vocal part.  \r\n\r\nA very long time ago, my girlfriend (who, next month, will have been my wife for 44 years) shared with me a wonderful cycle of poems entitled, “Chamber Music” by James Joyce.  Don’t be frightened!  This is the young James Joyce, the youthful genius who gave us “Dubliners” and “A Portrait of the Artist as  Young Man,” not the later, half-mad literatus who conferred “Ulysses” and “Finnegan’s Wake” upon a still baffled world. \r\n\r\nThe poems are written from a man’s point of view, yet I have cast them here to be sung by a woman.  For me, the woman is reading (singing) the man’s love poems back to him, as if to say, “Listen to yourself!  Hear what you sound like!  Understand how you come across!”  Viewed this way, the poems reveal clues as to why the relationship failed.  The woman “explains” this to the man as she says goodbye, using his own words, which are very beautiful and very overwrought.  One can see how she grew weary of such an ardent, needy and loquacious lover.  \r\n\r\nWhat are her feelings?  The music itself is the only hint.  Her feelings, a mingling of sorrow and relief are implied by the way she sings these poems, the way the words are set to music.\r\n\r\nThe seven poems I chose from “Chamber Music” (see below) tell the story, starting out naively happy, gradually darkening, ending in separation and farewell.\r\n\r\nExcept, not quite!  The long piano solo after the soprano finishes her last song, ends the cycle with resignation, yes, but also a wistful radiance.  “Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.”  \r\n\r\nAt the very end, the clarinet repeats a fragment of the naively happy ''springtime'' theme that begins the cycle, as if to say, “The possibility of Love is always present; Love may come again, even to the broken-hearted.”  \r\n\r\n“Along the River” was written for and is dedicated to mezzo soprano Diane Haslam.\r\n\r\nYou are among the few to have heard this beautiful music; the piece has been performed only about a half dozen times.   \r\n\r\nTo hear "Along the River” sung exquisitely and with delicate fervor by Mary Elizabeth Southworth, with flutist Danielle Hundley, clarinetist Marianne Breneman and pianist Phil Amalong (when the four of them perform together, they call their ensemble, “Conundrum,”) click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoems from “Chamber Music” by James Joyce, in the order in which they appear in “Along the River":\r\n\r\nI.   Strings in the earth and air\r\n     Make music sweet;\r\n     Strings by the river where\r\n     The willows meet.\r\n\r\n     There''s music along the river\r\n     For Love wanders there,\r\n     Pale flowers on his mantle,\r\n     Dark leaves on his hair.\r\n\r\n     All softly playing,\r\n     With head to the music bent,\r\n     And fingers straying\r\n     Upon an instrument.\r\n\r\nII.  I would in that sweet bosom be\r\n     (O sweet it is and fair it is!)\r\n     Where no rude wind might visit me.\r\n     Because of sad austerities\r\n     I would in that sweet bosom be.\r\n\r\n     I would be ever in that heart\r\n     (O soft I knock and soft entreat her!)\r\n     Where only peace might be my part.\r\n     Austerities were all the sweeter\r\n     So I were ever in that heart.\r\n\r\nIII. From dewy dreams, my soul, arise,\r\n     From love''s deep slumber and from death,\r\n     For lo! the trees are full of sighs\r\n     Whose leaves the morn admonisheth.\r\n\r\n     Eastward the gradual dawn prevails\r\n     Where softly-burning fires appear,\r\n     Making to tremble all those veils\r\n     Of grey and golden gossamer.\r\n\r\n     While sweetly, gently, secretly,\r\n     The flowery bells of morn are stirred\r\n     And the wise choirs of faery\r\n     Begin (innumerous!) to be heard.\r\n\r\nIV.  Silently she''s combing,\r\n     Combing her long hair\r\n     Silently and graciously,\r\n     With many a pretty air.\r\n\r\n     The sun is in the willow leaves\r\n     And on the dappeled grass,\r\n     And still she''s combing her long hair\r\n     Before the looking-glass.\r\n\r\n     I pray you, cease to comb out,\r\n     Comb out your long hair,\r\n     For I have heard of witchery\r\n     Under a pretty air,\r\n\r\n     That makes as one thing to the lover\r\n     Staying and going hence,\r\n     All fair, with many a pretty air\r\n     And many a negligence.\r\n\r\nV.  This heart that flutters near my heart\r\n     My hope and all my riches is,\r\n     Unhappy when we draw apart\r\n     And happy between kiss and kiss:\r\n     My hope and all my riches—yes!—\r\n     And all my happiness.\r\n\r\n     For there, as in some mossy nest\r\n     The wrens will divers treasures keep,\r\n     I laid those treasures I possessed\r\n     Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep.\r\n     Shall we not be as wise as they\r\n     Though love live but a day?\r\n\r\nVI.  O cool is the valley now\r\n     And there, love, will we go\r\n     For many a choir is singing now\r\n     Where Love did sometime go.\r\n     And hear you not the thrushes calling,\r\n     Calling us away?\r\n     O cool and pleasant is the valley\r\n     And there, love, will we stay.\r\n\r\nVII. Sleep now, O sleep now,\r\n     O you unquiet heart!\r\n     A voice crying "Sleep now"\r\n     Is heard in my heart.\r\n\r\n     The voice of the winter\r\n     Is heard at the door.\r\n     O sleep, for the winter\r\n     Is crying "Sleep no more."\r\n\r\n     My kiss will give peace now\r\n     And quiet to your heart—\r\n     Sleep on in peace now,\r\n     O you unquiet heart!\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 19, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),117);

I do?  I had to think.  Ohio strikes me as The Land of Missed Opportunities.  Greatness has often seemed almost within our grasp, but we lose heart, take the narrow view, opt for short-term gains, settle for less.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, when I heard a presidential candidate say, “Ohio is an amazing state!’ I thought, “So the claims are true; this candidate really is a liar.”  I’ve lived in Ohio all my life and the only thing about present-day Ohio that amazes me is Serpent Mound.  \r\n\r\nOhio was once an amazing place.  Just over two centuries ago Ohio was the greatest hardwood forest on the planet, intact since the retreat of the glaciers.  All gone, long since.  The settlers shaved the state bare.  If they had had the foresight to let the forest remain in just one county or even just one township — which is to say, just one 36 square mile area — that would be an amazing resource for study, discovery and appreciation, a world-class tourist attraction.  But no.  For short-term gain, they destroyed it ALL.\r\n\r\nToday Ohio is pleasant enough for the middle class and up.  But amazing?  No.\r\n\r\nDo I love Ohio?  It’s been my home, all my life.  It seems churlish not to say I love it.  \r\n\r\nI suppose we look upon our city, state and country with the same feelings we harbor, in old age, remembering our parents.  They were flawed, they got a lot wrong.  Yet we loved them and cherish their memory … because, we conclude, they did the best they could.  Some things they got right.\r\n\r\nMay our own children be as charitable in their summaries of us.\r\n\r\nOne small thing America got right was the song, “Shenandoah.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I’m asked, "What''s your favorite song?,” I answer, “Shenandoah.”  \r\n\r\nI’ve loved “Shenandoah” since I first heard it when I was 12, in Max Steiner’s score for “How The West Was Won.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was 23, I made the first of many hikes on the Appalachian Trail in the Shenandoah National Park.  \r\n\r\nThe Appalachian Trail is a thing America got right.  Another thing America got right was the amazing idea that there should be national parks.  Next month our great National Park Service will mark the hundredth anniversary of its founding.  That’s something to celebrate!\r\n	\r\nWhen I was 32, my wife and I, mindful of the song and the park, named our daughter Shenandoah.  \r\n\r\nStill later, we learned the meaning of this ancient, Native American word:  “Clear-eye’d Daughter of the Stars.”  That was how they described what we call Shenandoah river.  You have to admire a culture that could come up with a phrase like that one.\r\n  \r\nWhen I was 41, I wrote my Fantasia on “Shenandoah," for string quartet, paying homage to our most beautiful American folksong.  \r\n\r\nNow I’m 66 and technology has developed to the point that I can share this music with you.  For free!  And so easily!  \r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, when I wrote this music, I could not have conceived of sharing my work so readily.  Who came up with this whole electronic rigamarole that allows us such a privilege?  I don’t know their names but I know that they were Americans.  Ingenious Americans.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(57,replace(replace('What about this phrase “the Fine Arts?”  \r\n\r\nFine arts as opposed to what?  \r\n\r\nThe Crude and Clumsy Arts?\r\n\r\nSame with “Classical Music.”  \r\n\r\nWhat?  Do we mean to imply that other kinds of music “ain’t got no class?"\r\n\r\nFor some, the very notions of “Fine arts” and “Classical music” ring false.  Folk art and popular music can sometimes be very fine indeed.  \r\n\r\nTake dear old Grandma Moses.  Was she not a fine artist?  \r\n\r\nThink of Stephen Foster, J.P. Sousa, Scott Joplin, Louis Armstrong, Jerome Kern, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Pete Seeger, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon.  Their best works are classics …. and classy, too!\r\n\r\nOh, I know the definitions of these terms.  If “Fine” and “Classical” imply exclusivity, it’s  an accident of semantics.  Still, I wish we could come up with a better term for what we call “classical” music.  I’ve tried and failed.  Seemingly, no one else has succeeded either.  We suspect the term puts off potential listeners, but we’re stuck with it, I fear.\r\n\r\nThere is a legitimate warning here:  When we narrow our sensibilities, as when we categorize some things “classical” or “fine," we imperil our openness to and understanding of expressions that we can’t readily categorize.\r\n\r\nA cultivated friend, aware of this danger, told me, “If ever I write my autobiography, I am going to title it:  ''Impaired by Snobbery.’” \r\n\r\nHa!  The reason that’s funny is because we know that my friend “isn’t the only sucker in town.”  We’re all hobbled by snobbery, one way or t’other.  It’s comes with being human.\r\n\r\nThe Tao Te Ching warns against this, implicitly urging us to see through the fallacies we erect.\r\n\r\n	"When people see some things as beautiful,\r\n	other things become ugly.\r\n	When people see some things as good,\r\n	other things become bad.”\r\n\r\nWe instinctively organize everything into opposites.  Beautiful vs. ugly.  Good vs. bad.  Right vs. Left.  To name a few.  It’s useful, short-term, but it’s a childish way of looking at the world. \r\n\r\nOne of my oldest friends, Dick Ferrell, whom I’ve known since I was eleven years old, wrote a delightful little poem satirizing our tendency to reduce everything to opposites, coaxing us to move beyond that way of thinking … simply by hiking.\r\n\r\n\r\n	Hither and Yon\r\n\r\n	I''ve been to Hither many a time,\r\n	But I''ve never been to Yon.\r\n	I think I''ll travel there sometime.\r\n	I''ll wake up with the dawn.\r\n	I''ll lace my boots,\r\n	And grab my hat,\r\n	I''ll put my backpack on\r\n	And prob''ly be ''bout halfway there\r\n	Before they know I''m gone.\r\n\r\n	Have you ever wanted to visit a place\r\n	With a name like To or Fro?\r\n	Or If or When, or This or That,\r\n	Or maybe High or Low?\r\n	Or These or Those,\r\n	Or Now or Then\r\n	Or maybe Fast or Slow?\r\n	It''s such an easy thing to do.\r\n	Just get up and go.\r\n\r\nListening to music, we’ve often ‘hiked'' through and beyond the opposites of that art form ... loud-soft, fast-slow, major-minor, high pitch-low pitch.  These examples are purely musical, but music is also rich with stylistic opposites.  “Classical” vs. “Popular,” for instance.\r\n\r\nIn my music I often attempt a reconciliation of musical opposites, but also of stylistic opposites, seeing what happens when the gestures of disparate genres, such as “Classical” and “Popular” are juxtaposed.\r\n\r\nAmerican composers have a knack for this.  It is one of the blessings of living in a democracy, but no one, to my knowledge, explored that set of possibilities before Charles Ives (1874-1954).  Ives pioneered the reconciliation of popular music and classical music by mixing Civil War songs, hymns, band music and ragtime into his symphonies and sonatas.   That’s partly why Ives, for my money, is our greatest American composer and one of my heroes.\r\n\r\nOthers pushed further yet, exploring this impulse to reconcile musical gestures that had seemed hopelessly disparate;  Gershwin blended elements of jazz into a rhapsody, a concerto and a tone poem;  Copland built two of his ballets on cowboy songs and, in another, rendered world-famous the Shaker folk-hymn “Simple Gifts.”  Another example is Bernstein’s orchestral suite of the music he wrote for the Broadway musical, “West Side Story.”\r\n\r\nIn the music of those composers, the Popular and the Classical are presented simultaneously, each enriching the other, as opposites do when skillfully and satisfyingly reconciled.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me — at last! -- to the music I want to share with you today, my Variations on a Hiking Song for solo piano.  The theme is the well-known tune, “The Happy Wanderer.”  You know it, don’t you?  The chorus goes:  "Val-de-ree, val-de-rah!”  \r\n\r\nBut the variations are not exactly on “The Happy Wanderer.”  In fact, that tune is never actually heard, as such.  Instead the piece begins (and ends) with the bare, skeletal outline of the tune.  It’s pared down so much that it’s almost unrecognizable.  You’ll have to listen carefully to realize that the source of the lean, spare theme that opens the piece is “The Happy Wanderer.”\r\n\r\nMy idea was to reduce the tune to its barest minimum at the beginning, and again in the final variation, and then, in between, to ‘flesh out’ the skeletal tune through variations that alternate, more or less, between the Popular style and the Classical style.  \r\n\r\nThe music swings back and forth between those two supposedly opposing styles, even going to extremes, invoking the clichés of Popular music in one variation followed by an elegant “Classical” expression in the next.  \r\n\r\nThe distinctions between the two stylistic worlds are increasingly blurred as the piece goes on; gradually the music becomes ambiguous.  Are the later variations intended to be Popular or Classical? ironic or sincere? a parody or an homage?  \r\n\r\nBut there is no doubt at the end.  The final variation, a Requiem, is heartfelt, touching and sincere.  It’s like a benediction; it brings closure to the piece.  \r\n\r\nWhy did I end a delightful piece with a Requiem?  Because the piece was composed in 1992, in memory of my father, Richard Sowash, who died in 1991.  \r\n\r\nTo hear my friend Phil Amalong give a marvelous rendition of my Variations on a Hiking Song, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 17, 2016\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),85);

There are many intelligent, educated Americans who don’t grasp what it means to be a composer.  Author?  Painter?  Yes.  Composer?  Not so much.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?  We are a nation of music lovers but most of the music we love did not come to us from American classical composers.  It came from performers, improvisers, singer/songwriters.\r\n\r\nBeing both an author and a composer has allowed me to experience, first hand, how much Americans’ attitudes and assumptions differ regarding those two artistic professions.\r\n\r\nI’ve experienced the discrepancy many times.

In French public spaces there are statues of Berlioz, Chopin, Gounod, et al.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, in all of America there are only two statues of composers and, strictly speaking, neither of those two musical geniuses were composers; they were song-writers.  There’s the statue of George M. Cohan on Times Square and a statue of Stephen Foster here in Cincinnati’s Alms Park.  \r\n\r\nIn all of America, there is exactly one George Gershwin Elementary School.  Where? You’d guess NYC?

By definition, music must be audible.  It can be very soft, sure.  There can be brief rests between notes, phrases, movements.  But silent?  No.\r\n\r\nStillness?

Our predicaments concern her not.\r\n\r\nAbandon me there for a few minutes, seated on a hot slab in the sun-baked Corsican wilderness, while you listen to the Verdehr Trio performing the first movement of my Memories of Corsica, subtitled "Arid Heat.”  \r\n\r\nBe warned:  the music begins VERY quietly.  If your hearing, like mine, is fading, you may not hear any music for several seconds.  Be patient.  The violin and clarinet are melting in and out of one another, quietly intoning a middle C, back and forth between them.  That’s the ceaseless heat of the sun.  Then you’ll hear the pianist playing, in both hands, two octaves apart, a hollow, desolate melody, slow but rising and falling in sharp jerks.  That’s the zig-zagged outline of the moveless mountains.

It means a lot to me.  I hope that one message each week is not too often, lest you find yourself “awash with Sowash."\r\n\r\nI began sharing these weekly messages four years ago by sending them only to fans and friends with whom I had a face-to-face acquaintance, mostly Cincinnatians, all of whom knew how to pronounce my last name.  But the pool of recipients has gradually expanded, resulting in these messages now reaching folks who are at a loss to know how to pronounce my strange last name.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, I mused on the spelling of my curious sur-name and several of you wrote to kindly ask me how it should be pronounced.\r\n\r\nWhen I phone in an order for Chinese carry-out —or Greek, Thai, Indian, Mexican — the name has been variously understood as “Squash,” “Sasquatch,” “OshKosh” even “Sushi."\r\n\r\nWe Sowashes prefer the pronunciation, "SO-wash.”  Accent on the FIRST syllable, please.\r\n\r\nWrongly accenting the second syllable — "so-WASH" — makes it sound like a response to someone complaining about having gotten their hands dirty:  “So? WASH!”  \r\n\r\nOr the slurred inquiry of a half-looped friend:  “So … WASH new wish YOU?"    \r\n\r\nThe name was originally, “Sauvage,” a not uncommon French family name, the name of my French ancestors.  Johannes Sauvage arrived in Boston in 1737 and all Sowashes, what few there are of us, descend from Great-great-grandpa Johannes.  \r\n\r\nWhy would a Frenchman have the Germanic first-name “Johannes?”  Because the family, being Huguenots, fled the persecution of Louis XIV, curse his bones, hightailing it to Holland where, over the next 90 years, they apparently picked up the habit of naming their children with Dutch first-names, such as Johannes.  \r\n\r\n(I curse the bones of Louis XIV for turning a blind eye to the persecution perpetrated on the French Huguenots by their Catholic compeers and for revoking the Treaty of Nantes which had ended the Wars of Religion, promoting religious tolerance in France.  If Louis had been a liberal, I would be living in France.  I’d be French!  Not just Franco-American.  As it is, I take pride in being an American descendent of Huguenots, a distinction I share with Paul Revere and Davy Crockett.)\r\n\r\nThere were Sauvages in the Continental Army, qualifying me to be a Son of the American Revolution if I were attracted to that form of patriotic expression, which I am not.\r\n\r\nAround 1840, my ancestors arrived in western Pennsylvania and began spelling the name “s-o-w-a-s-h,” probably to accommodate their German-speaking neighbors.  In German, you get a “V” sound by writing a “W” -- as in “Wagner.”  To a German ear, “Sauvage” would be spelled “Sowasch.”  Drop the “c” and you arrive at "Sowash."\r\n\r\n"SO-wash" is thus an Americanization of “Sauvage."  \r\n\r\nWe like our names to be correctly pronounced.  Some radio broadcasters, seeing my name in print on the cover of a CD, deduce that it is to be divided down the middle, like this:  Sow + Ash.\r\n\r\nI don’t like it when someone pronounces my name as Sow + Ash because I don’t like having “sow,” a female pig, in my last name.  Nor do I like “ash.” \r\n\r\nWhat is Sow + Ash?  the incinerated remains of a female pig?  burnt bacon?  scorched ham?  sausage cinders?  cremated kielbasa?  \r\n\r\nCome to think of it, didn’t the pioneers use sow ash in the making of soap?\r\n\r\nContrariwise, SO + wash connotes wholesome domestic activities — sewing and washing -- and that’s just fine with me.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, that very phrase shows up in one of Walt Whitman’s most famous and affecting poems, “I Hear America Singing."\r\n\r\n"I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear ….\r\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at\r\n     work, or of the girl sewing or washing…”\r\n\r\nI noticed that when I set the poem to music.\r\n\r\nIt made me shake my head.  The things a composer gets into…\r\n\r\nBy the way, a great many American towns boast a street monikered with my family name.  What?  A street sharing its name with that of an obscure Midwestern composer active before and after the turn of the last century?  Well, sort of ...  \r\n\r\nA multitude of American municipalities have a Washington Street, almost always in the oldest part of town.  Some of these Washington Streets run north-south.  So a town will have a “North Washington Street” and a “South Washington Street.”  You see what’s coming?  Since “South Washington Street” has a little too many letters to squeeze onto a street sign, it’s often abbreviated to … you guessed it … “So.Wash. St.”  \r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nTo hear “Ardent Souls," the third movement of my Trio #3 for violin, clarinet and piano, subtitled “Memories of Corsica,” performed by the Verdehr Trio, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),33);

First, you can fix the food the way YOU like it to be cooked.  Second, you don’t have to clean up;  you can say, “OK, you guys, I cooked, now you wash the dishes.”  They''ll grumble, but they’ll do it.\r\n\r\nI love to cook.  I love everything about it.  My favorite spatula, our dear old cast iron skillet, the Japanese knife my son gave me for Christmas, our colorful porcelain Provençal olive oil dispenser, our brass pepper mill, my Kelly-green apron.  Searching out the recipes, buying the groceries at historic Findlay Market and at Avril’s, Cincinnati''s great downtown butcher shop.  I love the cooking, the serving, even the clean up (which I  do nowadays, there being no Scouts handy).  \r\n\r\nOur kitchen is tiny.  When our pastor, a Texan, visited our apartment and saw our kitchen, she put her hands on her hips, shook her head and said, “Wall!  This here’s what we call a one-ass kitchen.”  She had it right.\r\n\r\nA kitchen is best judged by the quality of the food that comes out of it.  Jo is tired of hearing me say that.  She yearns for “a nice kitchen” like the one we had in our first home as newlyweds, back in Bellville, Ohio.  \r\n\r\nIt was a sweet place.  We still refer to it as The Little Yellow House.  The rooms were small, but the kitchen was big enough to accommodate two or more persons without unduly frequent bumpings of bums, hips and elbows.\r\n\r\nWe loved that house.  We could hardly believe it was ours.  It seemed to us that it must belong to someone else:  serious, grownup people; not a couple of goofy kids like us.  When we painted a room, we said, “Whoever REALLY owns this house might be shocked by the new colors we’ve chosen.”  \r\n\r\nIn those days, we were taken with the watercolors of the Swedish painter Carl Larsen.  He depicted the rooms of his home, showing his family doing ordinary things -- watering house plants, reaching for a utensil, setting the table.  Charmed, we bought prints of his paintings, framed them, hung them on the walls of our home.  \r\n\r\n"Our home!”  For us, in those days, it was a thrill to use that phrase. \r\n\r\nI decided to try something like what Carl Larsen had done, to use our home as a subject matter, not for paintings but for a piece of music.\r\n\r\nIn 1978 I wrote a suite in seven movements, one for each room of the house, each movement expressing the character of that room.\r\n\r\nThe first movement, entitled “The Kitchen,” is bubbling and merry.\r\n\r\nI scored the work for flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon and invited friends to our home to play and listen to the premiere.  “Chamber” music, indeed!\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a saxophonist friend, Bill Perconti, re-scored the work for saxophone quartet.

The sweetness and sincerity of these paintings captured our fancy.  \r\n\r\nI suggest you google “Carl Larsen home paintings” and look at the images.  Delightful.\r\n\r\nWe bought prints of his paintings, had them framed and hung them in most of the seven little rooms of ’our little yellow house,’ as we’ve always called it.  \r\n\r\nLarsen inspired me to try something similar as a composer:  to use the rooms of our home as a subject matter for music.  That’s how the suite “Our Home” came to be.\r\n\r\nThe music for The Kitchen is bubbling and merry, The Composing Room is a careful canon, The Attic is quiet and thoughtful, The Dining Room quotes Shaker hymns, The Bedroom is a lullabye and/or a romantic love song and The Living Room is lively, a place of bustling jollity.  \r\n\r\nThe suite is friendly, fetching and naive (not unlike ourselves back then, in 1978 and, I hope, even still today).  We invited musician to premiere the work for a tiny audience of friends, playing the piece in the very rooms the music depicted.  \r\n\r\n“Chamber” music, indeed!\r\n\r\nI scored the suite for flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon;  later, a clarinetist transcribed the suite for clarinet quartet;  a few years ago Bill Perconti transcribed it for saxophone quartet and recorded it.\r\n\r\nYou’re invited to listen to Bill and his friends in the Alloy Saxophone Quartet playing the final movement, "The Living Room,” from the suite Our Home by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMarch 5, 2017\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\n“For this article, I’d like to get a photo of you in your studio,” said the free-lance writer, telephoning me to set up an interview.\r\n\r\nI laughed.  “Studio?  I have no studio.  I don’t even have a piano.”\r\n\r\nI told him:  "I’ve made up tunes in all sorts of circumstances, by humming and whistling while driving my car, while soaking in the tub, while on duty as a guard at the art museum.  If I come up with something interesting, I pencil a few notes on a scrap of paper so that I can recover it after I’ve forgotten it.  I throw the scraps in a drawer.  It’s a little mine of musical fragments.  Sometimes I open it and ‘pan for gold.’  If I find something that seems to want to be developed, I set up my computer and electronic keyboard on our dining room table and that’s where I do the notation work.  I have no studio."\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, though, I did have something like a studio.  Many years ago, back in the ’70’s, in our tiny first home, there was a half-finished section of attic with just enough room for the miniature harpsichord I had back then, along with a table, a chair and a shelf of reference books.  \r\n\r\nWe called it “The Composing Room” because that room was where I retreated to do the work of composing, notating music by hand.  Composers had no computers in those days, no “Finale" music notation programs;  all my early scores were hand-written in the neat calligraphy I had learned in college.  \r\n\r\nI remember my composition professor telling us, “No computer will ever be able to do music notation;  it’s far too complicated.”\r\n\r\nTwenty years after he told us that I bought “Finale” and undertook the vast task of transcribing all my hand-written scores into computer notation, generating scores that are far more professional in appearance than any I had written by hand. \r\n\r\nIn 1978 I wrote a suite for flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon entitled, “Our Home,” depicting each of the rooms in our tiny first house.  For the movement entitled “The Composing Room,” I fashioned a composer-ly display of rounds.\r\n\r\nYou know what a round is?  Think “Row, row, row your boat.”  One singer begins the tune, a second begins the same tune but a bit later, a third a bit after that, etc.  \r\n\r\nRounds are easy to learn and fun to perform but tricky to write because they have to be fashioned so as to ensure that when all the parts are simultaneously singing different sections of the same tune they still sound good together.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the round was a major leap in musical consciousness, as important to the development of music as the Renaissance discovery of perspective was to the development of art. \r\n\r\nNo one knows who made up the first round.  Before rounds, people sang, of course, but only in unison, we suppose.  Then one day ….\r\n\r\nI picture a scene such as Breugel might have painted, pot-bellied peasant louts in a tavern, rowdily singing.  One of them is so drunk that he starts singing the same tune as everyone else, only two bars too late.  And what do you know?  It works!  It sounds good!  Voilà!\r\n\r\nWhere did this happen?  Maybe in England.  The English round "Sumer Is Icumen In” (Summer is a-comin’ in) may be the earliest, dating from the mid-13th century.\r\n\r\nA hundred years later comes an Italian vocal form, a round for two voices with a text describing the hunt.  The name for this form was “caccia” — Italian for “hunt.”  It makes sense because one voice is, in effect, chasing the other voice, the way a hunter chases his prey, hard upon its heels. \r\n\r\nTwo hundred years later comes the English “catch," a 17th-century type of round, which may derive its name from “caccia.”  Again, one voice is pursuing, trying to ‘catch’ the other.\r\n\r\n“Will you troll the catch you taught me?” asks Caliban in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.”\r\n\r\nStephano replies, “At thy request, monster … Come, let us sing."\r\n\r\nRounds, rounds and more rounds.  Seven hundred “Sumers” after “Sumer Is Icumen In," we’ve not tired of them.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a saxophonist friend, Bill Perconti, re-scored “Our Home" for saxophone quartet.

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(63,replace(replace('If you grow up in Mansfield, Ohio, you know all about Johnny Appleseed.  When I was growing up there in the 1950’s, Johnny''s name was in lots of places around town. \r\n\r\nThere was the: \r\nJohnny Appleseed Junior High School (where my cousins went),\r\nJohnny Appleseed Boy Scout Council (of which my troop was a part),\r\nJohnny Appleseed Shopping Center (in the parking lot of which I learned to ride a bicycle), 	\r\nJohnny Appleseed Realty (through which my parents bought our home),\r\nand the Johnny Appleseed Coffee Shop in the Leland Hotel (where my Grandma sometimes took me to lunch).  \r\n\r\nThere was even a small, stone monument to Johnny Appleseed in South Park, next to the historic Blockhouse, a two-story log structure built in the pioneer days to defend Mansfield.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of 1812, Johnny Appleseed saved Mansfield from an Indian attack by running, alone, thirty miles south to Mount Vernon.  He convinced the soldiers stationed there to hurry back with him to Mansfield.  They marched quickly and arrived in the nick of time.  When the Indians saw the soldiers arriving, they called off their attack.  \r\n\r\nWe all knew this story.  For Mansfielders, it was the most important thing about Johnny Appleseed.  Of course we also knew that Johnny Appleseed planted apple trees so that the pioneers, newly arrived in the Ohio wilderness, would find fruit hanging from the bough.  \r\n\r\nApples were the only fruit available on the frontier and the pioneers used apples in many ways.  They made apple butter, apple sauce, apple pies and cider.  The ran string through apples and hung them up to dry, eating them months later.  They wrapped apples in burlap and buried them in the dirt floors of their cabin homes, digging them up months later, finding them still crunchy and edible.  Most importantly, the pioneers made vinegar from Johnny’s apples and used it to pickle their vegetables, preserving them against the long, cold Ohio winters, when gardens lay fallow and buried in snow.\r\n\r\nWe knew the facts about him.  His real name was John Chapman and he lived from 1774 until 1845.  It said so, right there on his monument.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me that Johnny Appleseed could be dismissed as a fictional character.  When I left Ohio to go to college I met students from other parts of the country who thought our hero was “just made up.”  That was a shock.  Even those who knew he was an historical figure didn’t revere him the way we did back home.  \r\n\r\nHe may be known to more Americans than any of our other folk heroes; every first grader has at least heard of Johnny Appleseed.  How many first graders have heard of Wyatt Earp?\r\n\r\nCuriously, our best known folk hero is unknown to Europeans.  My cultivated, well-traveled, well-read French and English friends were ignorant of Johnny''s life and achievements until they heard me talk about him.\r\n\r\nEven in this country, there’s confusion about him.  Though he was a real person, Johnny also became a mythic figure, a folk hero.  The notion that he went barefoot and dressed in rags (true) and wore a tin pot on his head (false) have rendered him slightly ridiculous.  Unfair.  Pioneer diaries and letters mention that Johnny often wore some pretty unusual hats, but none specify a tin pot.\r\n\r\nStill, the tin pot is here to stay.  We will always think of Johnny as barefoot, raggedly clad, a tin pot on his head.  The image befits a saint; Johnny has an “attribute.”  We recognize St. Peter because he’s the one holding the keys;  we recognize Johnny by the tin pot on his head.\r\n\r\nJohnny IS a saintly figure.  A deeply religious man, he practiced and preached his cherished Swedenborgianism to anyone who would listen, passed out pamphlets to anyone who would accept them.  He seems to have thought of himself as an American John the Baptist, a spiritual non-conformist, a voice in the wilderness, literally.  \r\n\r\nWhat did the pioneers make of him?  By all accounts, they loved him, eccentricities and all.  Dr. Betty Reed, who met the medical needs of rural Richland County for over sixty years, told me that the story passed along in her family was that her ancestors warmly welcomed Johnny but asked him to sleep in the barn, “because, you know, he didn’t smell very good."\r\n\r\nToday Johnny is under-appreciated.  Perhaps we need to deepen the understanding of him we all formed when we were in the first grade. \r\n\r\nJohnny is just about our only non-violent American folk hero.  Think about it.  American folk heroes are men and women of violent action:  Davy Crockett kills bears, Indians and Mexicans until the latter finally kill him; Betty Zane dares to run through the crossfire to bring back much-needed ammunition; Molly Pitcher loads cannons; Jim Bowie throws his knife; the Earps shoot it out at the OK Corral; there’s Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Doc Holiday; the ruthless bison-buster Buffalo Bill;  Billy the Kid and Bonnie and Clyde who rob banks and kill at random;  George Armstrong Custer, who massacres with a free hand and an untrammeled conscience until he gets himself massacred at the Little Big Horn, going down in ill-gotten ‘glory.''  \r\n\r\nEven our fictional folk heroes are "rough-oh, tough-oh":  Paul Bunyan levels old growth forests; Pecos Bill lassoes and rides tornadoes, Johnny Henry bursts his heart competing with a mechanical spike-driver.  There’s Frankie and Johnny.  Tom Dooley.  Casey Jones.  All violent.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions?  I can think of two.  There’s Betsy Ross.  She sews the flag, quietly, patiently, precisely.  \r\n\r\nThen there''s our Johnny, the nurturer.  He plants and tends apple trees.  Our kinda guy, you and me.  It does us good to be reminded of him.\r\n\r\nI’ve given many talks about Johnny to historical societies and in schools.  He is the subject of Chapter One in my book, “Heroes of Ohio.”  I wrote and starred in a half-hour documentary film about him.  I impersonated Johnny for fourteen September “Apple Fests” at Heritage Village in Cincinnati’s Sharon Woods Park, something I still do in various other places.  That’s right.  I present myself at events barefoot, in raggedy clothes, wearing bright red suspenders and a tin pot on my head.  On those occasions, for a little while, I get to BE Johnny Appleseed!\r\n\r\nWe even named our son after him:  John Chapman Sowash.  He goes by “Chapman.”  We call Chap for short.\r\n\r\nLater on this morning, as I do every year on the Sunday closest to Johnny''s birthdate — September 26 —I will speak up during the part of our church service we call ''Prayers of the People,'' giving thanks for the life, contributions and example of Johnny Appleseed, America’s best-known non-violent folk hero and the unofficial patron saint of my home state, Ohio.\r\n\r\nI’ve written several pieces of music about J.A., including a duo for violin and cello entitled “A Suite of Virtues:  A Tribute to John Chapman.”  There are seven movements, each evoking an old-fashioned virtue:  Optimism, Enterprise, Perseverance, Certitude, Soulfulness, Joyfulness and Faith.\r\n\r\nAlas, it’s never been recorded so I can’t share any of it with you.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, how about THIS for an idea?  If you’re a violinist or a cellist, here’s an opportunity.  Just ask and I’ll send you free PDFs of the sheet music for this duo; you can print ‘em and play the piece.  If you find that you like it and would kindly record it, send me the mp3s and I’ll feature your performance in these weekly emails. \r\n\r\nI’ve also written a three-movement choral work about Johnny, entitled “Apple Songs,” another of my works which is still waiting to be recorded.  I made a baritone-piano version of "Apple Songs" and one of those, “The Planting of the Apple Tree,” HAS been recorded.  See above.\r\n\r\nThe text is by William Cullen Bryant:\r\n\r\nCome, let us plant the apple-tree.\r\nCleave the tough green sod with the spade;\r\nWide let its hollow bed be made;\r\nThere gently lay the roots with kindly care,\r\nAnd press it o’er them tenderly,\r\nAs, round the sleeping infant’s feet,\r\nWe softly fold the cradle sheet;\r\nSo we plant the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nWhat do we plant in this apple-tree?\r\nBuds, which the breath of summer days\r\nShall lengthen into leafy sprays;\r\nBoughs where the thrush, with crimson breast,\r\nShall haunt and sing and hide her nest.\r\nWe plant, upon the sunny lea,\r\nA shadow for the noontide hour,\r\nA shelter from the summer shower,\r\nWhen we plant the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nTo hear baritone Noel Bouley and collaborative pianist Phil Amalong perform my setting of "The Planting of the Apple Tree," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nSeptember 25, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),119);

And that is tall! … for a Hobbit.\r\n\r\nAs Shakespeare has Helena say of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, “Though she be but little, she is fierce!"\r\n\r\nFierce in defense of those she loves, I hasten to add.  She is a thoughtful, kindly, deeply caring and supportive mother and partner, the keystone of our little family and my closest friend for all these years.\r\n\r\nOne of the dearest folk-hymns of the Kentucky Shakers is entitled, “Love is Little.”  That hymn makes me think of Jo because she is little and loving and because she lullabyed our children with that hymn when they were very small.\r\n\r\nHere are the hymn''s sweet, simple words:\r\n\r\nLove is little.\r\nLove is low.\r\nLove will make my spirit grow.\r\n\r\nGrow in peace.\r\nGrow in light.\r\nLove will do the thing that’s right.  \r\n\r\nI wrote a set of variations on the hymn tune, entitling it a little whimsically:  “Six Lovely Little Variations on Love is Little.” \r\n\r\nI’ve written very nearly all of my music for particular musician friends, shaping my compositions to suit their tastes and personalities and keeping in mind the occasions when they might use the piece in performance.   This piece is the exception to that practice, insofar as I wrote it only for myself to play, upon my soprano recorder and as a little homage to my “Jo."\r\n\r\nIt works just fine when played on the clarinet, too.  You can hear it played by clarinetist Laurel Bennett, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to see a cute photo of Jo and me, taken in Rocky Mountain National Park, copy and paste the link below into your browser.\r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/photo_jo_rick.jpg\r\n\r\nIsn’t she adorable?\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 2, 2016\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),139);

I’m like the fellow Samuel Johnson described, who "tried all his life to be a philosopher but cheerfulness kept breaking in."\r\n\r\nI have written a few darker pieces.  A handful are sad and a few are mysterious.  These are not often heard because classical music radio stations rarely broadcast them and musicians shy away from performing such music for audiences.  It''s understandable.  \r\n\r\nExcept at funerals and commemorative events, we rarely welcome sad music.  I love Puccini’s saddest music; it makes me weep big, salty, cathartic tears.  But generally I avoid sad music.  If I turn on the radio and find myself in the middle of the last movement of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony, I switch to NPR.  Life is sufficiently difficult without having to endure that master’s final, despairing utterance yet again.\r\n\r\nMysterious music isn''t so offputting, though … when the full moon illuminates our familiar surroundings with a strange, silvery luster, mysterious music might be just what we want.  \r\n\r\nThe Nocturne from my Trio #6 for clarinet, cello and piano, subtitled "Goddess of the Moon," is my attempt to evoke the mystery, beauty and a little of the madness we associate with the moon, moonlight and Diana, the ancient Greek goddess of the moon.\r\n\r\nThink of this music as a love duet, sung by a mezzo and a baritone in a moonlit landscape, a scene from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, taking place simultaneously in ancient Greece and rural England.  \r\n\r\nThink of the clarinet as the mezzo and the cello as the baritone.  Think of the piano as the moonlit landscape, its white keys gleaming through the gloom of the black keys, like the full moon glimmering through a criss-cross of black branches. \r\n\r\nThat’s a pretty thought.  Strangely, what I most want to say about this music must remain unsaid for lack of a suitable word.  \r\n\r\nFor all its richness, this language we’ve borrowed from the English and adapted to meet the needs of the New World, occasionally abandons us, leaving us hobbled and halting.  At such moments we’re made to know that this glorious vehicle of expression, the language of Shakespeare, is ramshackle after all.  \r\n\r\nThe word that’s missing is an adjective that would refer directly to the moon, to its unique character.  The same holds true for the sun.  Consider that the sun crosses our sky every day and the moon, too, most nights.  Odd, no?, this paucity of pertinent verbiage?  \r\n\r\nI suppose every language has these curious gaps, these voids that leave writers grasping and speakers gasping.\r\n\r\nWe have perfectly good words for the heavenly bodies themselves:  the moon, the sun.  But scarcely any adjectives.  \r\n\r\nWe use “moony” to refer to someone who seems dreamy, unaware of their surroundings, disconnected from reality (usually because they are in love) but we never use the word to refer to the moon itself.  We never say, “That Nocturne is distinctly moony.”  Or “Last night seemed moonier than usual, didn’t you think?”  Or “Tonight marks the mooniest night of the month."\r\n\r\nDare we improvise? … venturing something like “moonish?” or “moon-ique?” "moonistic?” or “moon-esque?”  “moon-icious?”    Yikes!\r\n\r\nOur sole recourse is the Latinate word “lunar.”  It serves us well enough for scientific stuff. We speak of lunar landings or the lunar calendar of ancient Babylon.  But if I were to assert that, in this movement, I had attempted to write lunar music, you’d smile.  Moony music?  You’d chuckle.  Moonish music?  You’d sniff and roll your eyes.  Moonistic music?  Please.  \r\n\r\nIt’s the same with the sun.  True, we have the word ’sunny’ but, like ‘moony,'' it has a special, homespun meaning.  We speak of a sunny smile, a sunny disposition.  But who speaks of ''the planets in the sunny system?’  Again, for scientific things, we use ’solar.’  Jo and I will soon have solar panels (not ‘sunny’ panels) on our rooftop.  But a solar smile?  a solar disposition?  solar music?  We speak of solar rays, but never of solar days.\r\n\r\nCurious, isn’t it?  that an English-speaking composer is thus forestalled.  A fissure in our linguistic landscape, a crevasse too wide for leaping, precludes the expression of a simple, obvious aspect of this music — and it''s something that I really want to get said!\r\n\r\nI’ll try one more time:  I wanted to fashion a music that would be …. what ... ‘moon-image-derived?’   \r\n\r\nWhoa.  That’s hideous.  As my friend Chris Miller would say, “Jeezle Peets!"\r\n\r\nThen again, if it''s obvious to listeners that the music is “moon-image-derived,” then it doesn’t need to be stated in words.  The music will express the notion musically.  See what you think.\r\n\r\nTo hear my Nocturne played with dark, beautiful passion by clarinetist Joe Rosen and some friends of his (Joe recorded it in his living room some years ago and can no longer recall which of his many musical friends were playing the cello and the piano on that occasion), click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nOct. 16, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThere''s a full moon this weekend.\r\n\r\nMost of my music is sunny, optimistic, bucolic.

A handful are sad or mysterious and one, just one, is really angry.   These are rarely heard because classical music radio stations shy away from broadcasting them and musicians shy away from performing them.   Do audiences really want to hear such stuff?

What is the clarinet but a mezzo?  What is the cello but a baritone?  What is the piano but a moonlit landscape?

I dismissed such assertions as mere propaganda, a ‘come hither’ pitch devised by a marketing team commissioned by Vermont’s Department of Tourism to attract leaf-peepers. \r\n\r\nI expressed my disdain, right out loud, for anyone to hear.  Fool that I was, I maintained that  "Orange is orange!  Red is red!  Purple is purple!  What appreciable difference can there be between the autumn foliage of Vermont and, say, Ohio?”\r\n\r\nThen came an October when we made the drive from Williamstown MA to Burlington VT.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I was wrong.”\r\n\r\nThat’s the line the agnostic journalist H.L. Mencken kept at the ready, rehearsing for his arrival in Heaven, should such a place exist and should such a moment arrive.  Mencken told his friends that when and if he should find himself in the august company of the Twelve Apostles, he would simply say:  “Gentlemen, I was wrong.”\r\n\r\nThe things artists know for certain about their own work can be wrong.  Mark Twain maintained that his best writing was to be found in his now forgotten historical novel Joan of Arc.  Maybe he was right; I’ve never read it; nor, so far as I know, has anyone else in my circle of acquaintances.  When I want to pass time in the company of Mark Twain, I re-read Huckleberry Finn.  \r\n\r\nWe artistic types can be mistaken, too, as to whether or not a particular work is finished and complete.  \r\n\r\nThe music I want to share today began as a choral setting of Prospero’s great speech from The Tempest, the one that opens with “Our revels now are ended” and closes with “we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep.”  \r\n\r\nWhen I finished my setting of that magnificent text, I thought I was finished with the tune.  Apparently the tune wasn’t finished with me.  A few years later it grew into the second movement of my Piano Trio #4, beautifully and lovingly recorded by the Mirecourt Trio.  I had nailed it this time, for sure.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the Mirecourt Trio play it, I realized that I had been wrong, once again.  Oh, they played it perfectly!  But at the climax of the movement, I had written the cello part so extremely high that only a consummate virtuoso like Terry King could hope to render it.  \r\n\r\nI was present for the recording session and Terry did more than sixty ‘takes’ before he was satisfied.  Sixty!  It was agonizing because I knew that the blame lay upon my own poor judgment.  \r\n\r\nI offered to re-score the movement but Terry was determined to tackle it.  Finally, he did.   Beautifully, as you’ll hear shortly.  \r\n\r\nHowever, because of that grotesquely high passage, the trio has remained the least performed of my best chamber works.\r\n\r\nHere was this richly expressive, autumnal music, secreted away and mouldering, imprisoned and silenced in a piece that few musicians would ever dare attempt to play.\r\n\r\nYet the tune is lovely — it’s a singing tune, a melodic tune, a choral tune, after all!  \r\n\r\nSome years later, the music grew yet again, transforming itself into another choral work, this time a setting of these wise, autumnal, Prospero-like words by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross:\r\n\r\n“For someone who has not first loved, death always comes too soon.  But for those who embrace the energies of life, joy in creation, compassion and love, the fear of death has long since disappeared."\r\n\r\nAt last I knew that I had nailed it.  \r\n\r\nTime passed.\r\n\r\nThen my cellist friend Josh Aerie asked me to write a piece he could play with his flutist and pianist friends in their newly-formed Sylvan Trio.  Suddenly, I saw a chance to rectify the ‘problem’ of the cello being required to play the almost impossibly high notes in the piano trio movement:  re-score the music yet again and give those high notes to the FLUTE!  \r\n\r\nI devised a four-movement suite for the Sylvan Trio entitled Seasonal Breezes and the wandering tune has, at last, found its final resting place in the “Autumn Breeze” movement. They plan to record the suite; one of these days I’ll share it with you.\r\n\r\nI’ve nailed it at last!\r\n\r\n(Or am I wrong, once more?

INSERT INTO liner_notes VALUES(71,replace(replace('“We are all on a voyage and none of us has arrived.”  That’s what our former pastor, Rev. Steve Van Kuiken, used to tell us.\r\n\r\nI had that in mind in 1998, when I wrote my first trio for clarinet, cello and piano, a work that aspires to describe, musically, a spiritual journey.  \r\n\r\nA journey must have a beginning point.  The first movement is lovely, sad and mysterious, trying to reconcile resigned yearning with an intense awareness of the beauty of the world, of life.  It''s ''a tall order,’ as we Midwesterners say, but that was what I was trying to achieve.  I figure, “Might as well aim for the stars!”\r\n\r\nThe second movement evokes the attempt most of us make to find meaning in Life through romantic love and, later, through nostalgia.  A crisis is reached in the third movement, when the instruments intone an “Alleluia” which was an important part of the Lutheran liturgy in the church of my boyhood.  \r\n\r\nThe fourth movement starts out to be an exuberant, joyful finale.  Doubt and mystery are soon felt again; the mysterious music of the first movement recurs; indeed, the music almost stops altogether.  Only the slow, strange ruminations of the cello keep it alive.  Then Beauty, if not Certitude, is reaffirmed and the piece ends -- not with a strong, positive gesture, but with a slowing, fading, rising gesture, ambiguously suggesting both resolution and non-resolution.  It seems to say, “The music ceases, but the voyage continues."\r\n\r\nToday, I want to share only the beautiful, strange first movement.  It is beautiful, partly because it uses harmonic progressions we remember from Bach.  His music compelled us to love them.  It is strange, partly because it is cast in 7/4, a meter which Bach, the most prolific of composers, never employed.  Also, each phrase of the tune, as you’ll hear immediately, has an odd, symmetrical structure:  four notes played first as quarter notes, then eighth notes, then sixteenth notes — and then in reverse — the next four notes are played as sixteenth notes, then eighth notes, then quarter notes.  \r\n\r\nSee what you make of it.\r\n\r\nThough I did not know it at the time, this trio, turned out to be the beginning of a much larger spiritual journey; it was the first of fifteen works I wrote for this combination of instruments, far more than I’ve written for any other combination of instruments.  I was obsessed with the possibilities inherent in combining a clarinet, a cello and a piano.  And the fifteen trios, considered as a whole, set a trajectory that culminated in my clarinet concerto, probably the best of all my works.\r\n\r\nThe Trio #1 was just the beginning.  It was my response to a request from my friend the French clarinetist Lucien Aubert and his ensemble, “les Gavottes.”  Lucien and his family live on the island of Corsica;  he kindly hosted us in his home for a five-night stay  two years ago.  What a sweet little family he has.  What a sweet home, what a sweet island.  A place of magic:  Lucien’s two little girls loved spotting how I did my corny disappearing-coin tricks.  Sometime I want to share with you another work of mine, subtitled “Memories of Corsica."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to hear the first movement of my Trio #1 for clarinet, cello and piano "Voyage of the Spirit” performed by the French ensemble “les Gavottes” and recorded by them on the CD “Enchantement d’avril," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJan. 31, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nA few years ago I opened our mailbox to find a card from a lady with whom I was only slightly acquainted.  She wrote to tell me that a few years earlier she had attended a concert of my music where she had bought several of my CDs.  "To be honest," she wrote, "I had never opened them."  \r\n\r\nThen, a few weeks prior, her nine-year-old nephew died.  She drove nine hours, alone, to attend the funeral.  Just before leaving, she grabbed an armful of CDs and, by chance, mine were among them.  \r\n\r\nShe had written to tell me that, as she drove, she listened to my CDs, over and over and over, all the way there and back again after the funeral.  The music, she said, engaged her, made her smile sometimes and sometimes weep.  The music eased her pain, she said, eased her sad journey.  She said the music consoled her.\r\n\r\nThis was the greatest compliment I will ever receive.  It''s all the more meaningful because, when I wrote the music recorded on those CDs I did not dream that my tunes might solace someone in grief.  Much of my music is happy and snappy, sometimes wistful, sometimes almost trite.  Who would imagine such creations could comfort anyone?\r\n\r\nSome critics hate my music, some love it.  That''s to be expected.  But of what value is the opinion of any critic when compared to the content of that card?  A rave in the New York Times, a standing ovation at Carnegie Hall, a Pulitzer Prize ... these would not mean as much.\r\n\r\nI have breakfast every now and then with one of my oldest friends;  we''ve been pals since the 5th grade.  He has a nephew who is a composer.  I''ve never met this nephew and I''ve never heard any of his music but my friend tells me that his nephew has come through one of our most prestigious conservatories of music, where he learned to write music that would "attract critical attention."  He''s in a PhD program now, doubtless destined to land a tenured slot as a Composition Professor in some lofty Conservatory or School of Music where he will compose yet more avant garde music that few people really want to hear and direct his students to do the same.\r\n\r\nSigh.\r\n\r\nI told my friend about the card sent by the lady whose nephew died.  I told my friend that by writing avant garde music his nephew may win critical acclaim and a tenured faculty position but that such music will never elicit a compliment like the one I received from the grieving aunt.  My friend said I was probably right, but what can he do?  He can''t very well tell his nephew how to write music, how to shape his career.\r\n\r\nMe, I''m one of those fools who rushes in where angels fear to tread ... if I ever meet this nephew, I''ll tell him about the card the lady sent me.  I''ll try to gently caution him.  I''ll ask him to consider an alternative to the easy, obvious path to critical, academic and material success.

It’s been like that almost since he learned to talk.  I never have to explain to him what I think or feel; he already knows.\r\n\r\nWe have a great deal in common and a few differences.  I''m religious, he’s not.  He has no religious practices, never prays so far as I know.  He goes to church only when he''s a paid soloist (trombone) or once in a while as a favor to me when one of my anthems is being performed in the service.  \r\n\r\nAnd yet …\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I said to him, “You’re thirty years old.  You’ve had some experience of Life.  I’d like to ask you a question to which there are three possible responses.  I’m curious to know which response you’d embrace.”\r\n\r\n“OK,” he said, immediately intrigued, sensing Big Stuff.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe,” I asked, “that, A, the universe is prejudiced against your development, actively opposing the flowering of your talents, stifling your efforts to fulfill your destiny by bringing your gifts to the wider world?  \r\n\r\n"Or … do you believe that, B, the universe is indifferent, neither opposing nor supporting your efforts?  \r\n\r\n"Or … do you believe that, C, the universe is prejudiced in favor of your development and actively assists and encourages your efforts, opening doors and seeing to it that one opportunity leads to the next?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go with the third option,” he said, immediately.\r\n\r\nI nodded.  “Then you have all the religion you’ll ever need.”\r\n\r\nEmbracing the third option is the essence of religion, it seems to me.  The accoutrements — scriptures, steeples, sanctuaries, sacraments — are finnimbruns, finicky finnimbruns.  Lovely, charming, stirring even -- but ancillary.\r\n\r\nI love how Odell Shepard expresses this ’third option’ in his quiet book, The Cabin Down the Glen. He wrote the words below in the 1930’s.  Can you look beyond the dated sexism of his pronouns to the era-transcending wisdom of his thought?  \r\n\r\n	"The faith … has only one article in its creed:  that there is an inexhaustible spring in the meadow of the world upon which we may draw for all that we need.  There is some Power ... waiting to help, to cheer, and to guide us.  I do not care to name it now, for all names are limitations, but I believe that each of the great worships of the world has been addressed to this Power, has been the rediscovery by some direct and penetrative mind of a truth that all right-living men have always dimly known.  …  Here is the tap-root of the tree of religion; from this all the pantheons have sprung. ...  A man who has this faith has religion, no matter what may be his creed or his lack of one."\r\n\r\nI’ve written a fair amount of sacred vocal music:  hymns and anthems intended to be sung in worship services at my beloved Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church, an enclave of progressive Christians, just a mile up the hill from my home in downtown Cincinnati.  I know that my fellow congregants, most of whom receive these weekly emails, will embrace Mr. Shepard’s words.  Maybe I will set those words to music and sing them in church sometime.\r\n\r\nYet some of my instrumental pieces are also charged with a feeling I''d term religious.\r\n\r\nOne such is the second of my Three Piquant Pieces for oboe & strings, titled simply, “Adagio." \r\n\r\nTo hear this “Adagio” beautifully played by oboist Amy Dennison, violinist Marion Peraza de Web, violist Katherine Cinelli and cellist Ellen Shertzer, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJanuary 8, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),46);

I send free PDFs of the sheet music for my scores to any musician who contacts me, curious to discover my work.  I give them permission to print the scores and parts and play the music for free, anytime, anywhere.  \r\n\r\nI give away CDs of my music, too.  If you want them, reply with your physical address and I’ll mail you a box full.  CDs of my music, sitting on the shelf here in our tiny apartment, bless no one.  I’d much rather you shelve them at your place (after listening to them a time or two, of course!).\r\n\r\nFor decades I tried to squeeze a little cash out of my music by selling sheet music of my works and CDs of my music, coaxing commissions, pushing for radio broadcasts and concert performances to beef up my quarterly ASCAP royalty checks.  One year, my best, I grossed $13,000 solely from my music.  That was amazing.  All the other years what I earned from my art  didn’t amount to half that much or even a quarter of that much..\r\n\r\nNo matter.  I found many other interesting ways to earn enough to keep the wolf from the door.\r\n\r\nLately, for the first time in my life, I’ve been teaching; French, Music Theory and The Art of Storytelling, three days a week, to young people who are 10 to 18 years old, at “Leaves of Learning," a local resource center that offers enrichment courses for kids who are otherwise home-schooled.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached my sixties, the impulse to convert my tunes into ''Happy Cabbage’ ($$$) came to seem a less than worthy expenditure of energy.   The thought occurred to me:  “I never paid a nickel for any of my ideas.  They all came to me for free.  Why am I trying to sell them?  The thing to do is to pass them along, free of charge.”\r\n\r\nSages agree:  the universe is to you exactly what you are to it.

Just listen.”\r\n\r\nMany Americans are less than confident about their ability to grasp so-called ‘classical music.’  .  The very phrase ‘classical music’ suggests that there are “insiders” and “outsiders” and that, when it comes to music like this, if you’re not an “insider,” you can "fuh-GED-about-it.”\r\n\r\nHigh walls, not of my making, shut out many people from the kind of music I’ve aspired to write, the tradition I’ve tried to carry forward on my own terms, in my own time.  \r\n\r\nThis was forcibly brought to my attention early on, back in 1970, when I landed a summer job ‘riding shotgun’ on a Stroh’s beer truck.  One of the drivers, Ed, loved music and we talked about it a lot.  Ed told me, “Your kind of music has no stories.”  I asked him what he meant.  \r\n\r\nHe turned on the radio and we listened for a little while.  “See?” he said.  “She’s a waitress in a truck stop and she’s had her heart broke.  Along comes this good-lookin’ trucker and she’s tryin'' to decide if she should make a pass at him.  It’s a story, you got to give it that.”\r\n\r\nIt was a story, sure enough.  In all the works of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, you won’t find anything like it.\r\n\r\nEd wasn’t a fool.  He was kindly, thoughtful, soft-spoken and hard-working.  Though he would not have used the word, what he wanted from music was humanity.  To be sure, the music of Beethoven and the rest offers plenty of humanity, but Ed would not have perceived it there; he needed a story.\r\n\r\nOur conversations made me think, gave me some perspective on what I was being taught as a music composition major at the university School of Music to which I returned when the summer ended.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry; I didn’t start writing C & W songs.  But I realized that programmatic titles welcome listeners in search of a story.  A piece of music entitled “Deep Forest” is more likely to engage  listeners than the same piece would if it were entitled “Sonata.”  \r\n\r\nI renewed the respect I’d had as a child for the expressive power of simple triads and traditional chord progressions.  I came to see why certain tunes are so well-known and well-loved:  hymns, marches, the songs that were sung in those days by the great Pete Seeger (he’d have been protesting yesterday, as I was, here in Cincinnati, along with 7,000 others) and the handful of songs that “everybody knows,” like Take Me Out to the Ballgame and Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\r\n\r\nA few years later, I found my voice as a composer, the result of all I’d learned, heard and pondered.\r\n\r\nFor the next four decades I wrote music that is … what?  “Classical?”  \r\n\r\nThere’s that pesky word again.  Ugh.\r\n\r\nA Vermont cellist recently emailed me, describing my music as “tuneful while unmistakably of our time (not imitation classical).”\r\n\r\nNot imitation classical.  I like that.  I’ve often groped for a phrase that would summarize my life’s work.  A laconic Vermonter came close! \r\n\r\nStill, good as it is, it’s a mouthful, a string of words.  \r\n\r\nGregg Smith, the celebrated choral director, told me that my music was “folky but not hokey.”  \r\n\r\nThat’s short and funny and it even rhymes.  But it still doesn''t quite fly as an answer to the question, “What kind of music do you write?”   \r\n\r\nI wish a description of my work could be conveyed in a single, widely-understood word.  \r\n\r\nSorry.  The closest word we have is ... “classical."\r\n\r\nThe music I want to share with you today is pretty, triadic and simple.  It’s "folky but not hokey.”  It’s "not imitation classical.”  All well and good.  Even so, it “doesn’t have a story” or even a programmatic title.

I should hardly admire more if real stars fell and lodged on my coat.  Nature is full of genius, full of the divinity; not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand.\r\n	Wheels of the storm-chariots, each of these countless snow-stars comes whirling to earth, pronouncing, with emphasis, the number six.\r\n	What a world we live in! where myriads of these little disks, so beautiful to the most prying eye, are whirled down on every traveller’s coat, the observant and the unobservant, and on the restless squirrel’s fur, and on the far-stretching fields and forests, the wooded dells, the mountain-tops.  \r\n	Far, far away from the haunts of man, they roll down some little slope, ready to swell some little rill.  There they lie, like the wreck of chariot-wheels after a battle in the skies.  Meanwhile the meadow mouse shoves them aside in his gallery, the schoolboy casts them in his snowball, the woodman’s sled glides smoothly over them, these glorious spangles, the sweeping of heaven’s floor.”\r\n\r\n	Thoreau''s lively, leaping, impassioned prose conjoins the humble and the exalted, seeming to say quite all that prose is capable of saying on the subject of snowflakes.\r\n\r\n	Only the conciseness of poetry could best it.

And to the television series.  Not the current one, please no.  The Sherlock series I love is the one produced by the BBC between 1984 and 1994, with the incomparable Jeremy Brett in the title role.  Recently, I’ve been watching that series all over again, in sequence.  \r\n\r\nThis marks my fifth or sixth viewing of the series since those happy days when our kids were infants and we’d get them settled by 8pm on Thursday nights so as to watch the latest episode.  Scrupulously accurate, lovingly made, they delight me as much as ever.  (The Holmes episodes, I mean, not the kids, though they also delight me as much as ever.)\r\n\r\nI mention my enthusiasm for Sherlockiana because the music I want to share with you today strikes me as Holmesian in several respects.  I wonder if you’ll agree?\r\n\r\nIt’s the Waltz from my Convivial Suite for violin and cello, written in 1999, exactly a hundred years, come to think of it, after the era in which the Holmes stories take place.  It’s a suite in seven short movements:\r\n		I. Fugue \r\n		II. Waltz\r\n		III. Blues\r\n		IV. March\r\n		V. Adagio\r\n		VI. Finale\r\n\r\nWe know Sherlock played the violin, and very skillfully, too, but what about Holmes’ friend and colleague, Dr. Watson?  He never claims the ability to play a musical instrument.  But what if he did and just never got round to mentioning it?  Might we imagine Dr. John H. Watson passing a rainy evening playing the cello alongside Sherlock’s violin?  What sort of music would find favor with that convivial duo?\r\n\r\nAnd they are a convivial duo, one of the great convivial duos, right up there with Huck & Jim, Frodo & Sam, Bertie & Jeeves.\r\n\r\nI wrote this convivial "Convivial Suite" for two pairs of friends who enjoy playing the violin and cello together.  One was a pair of Cincinnatians, Christine Nichols (violinist) and Bernice Robinson (cellist).  Bernice suggested the idea and I was toying with it when another cellist friend, Terry King, happened to make the same suggestion, asking for a piece he could could play with his violinist wife, Laura Bossert. \r\n\r\nBecause it was written for friends, I decided to call the piece “Convivial Suite.”  \r\n\r\nThe Waltz movement is the most Sherlockian of the set.  Why?  Because it shares many of the qualities we love in the best of Watson’s (really Doyle’s) accounts of his adventures with Holmes.\r\n\r\nFirst, this little Waltz is cozy.  All the Holmes stories begin in the cozy comfort of that famous apartment at 221B Baker Street.  We’re given delectable bits of information about it;  the Persian slipper on the mantle in which Holmes stores his pipe tobacco, the bullet holes in the wall that spell out “V R” (Victoria Regina), the chemistry set, the gasogene (a Victorian-era device for producing carbonated water), the files of past cases, the newspapers strewn on the floor, the comings and goings of the landlady, Mrs. Hudson, who brings in meals and announces strange visitors.  \r\n\r\nI love to imagine the conversations Mrs. Hudson must have had with her friends.  She must have had friends, though they are never mentioned in the stories.  Good friends, admiring and envious friends, elderly widows like herself, landladies.  She must have held her circle spellbound with accounts of the eccentricities of her famous second-floor tenant and his bizarre, outlandish clients.  \r\n\r\nWe are made to feel all the cozier by the reminders of the weather, which is usually foul; there is rain and fog and the splash and clop of hooves resounds on the wet pavements but a few feet away.  Still, in this apartment, we are warm, dry, well fed and safe.  I say “we” because Doyle contrives to give us the feeling that we are present, that there are three of us there:  Holmes, Watson and you, we, us, the gentle Reader.  \r\n\r\nThen arrives a visitor with a curious tale and a problem.  Evil is a-stir and malevolent doings demand a close investigation.  We are off!  As Holmes says, quoting Shakespeare, "The game is afoot!”\r\n\r\nCozy as the music is, I think you’ll find that there is something a little odd about it, too.  A certain savor of the exotic and sinister.  The tales are replete with the exotic and the sinister.  Curious weapons, secret poisons, arcane codes.  Outlandish animals, too.  A mongoose, a  killer orangutan.  The Speckled Band turns out to be a venomous snake, native to India, who, we are told, feeds on milk and can be trained to respond to the low whistle of its master.  Then there is the chilling reference to the Giant Rat of Sumatra, the ghastly account of which is never explicated because, we are told, “the world is not yet prepared.”  One wonders what preparations must be undertaken by the world before Doyle deems it ready, at last, for this story to be told.\r\n\r\nThe music?  Well, listen and see if you don’t hear something suggestive of the vast world that lies “out there," far removed from the calm. orderly, habitable handful of acres where our daily lives are lived, our steady habits prevail, where we contentedly earn and munch upon our quotidian bread.\r\n\r\nOh, reading those stories, we catch a glimpse of how very much more there is in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in our philosophy.\r\n\r\nMystery and suspense are always at the core of the doings of Watson and Holmes.  Holmes grasps what is happening far more quickly than Watson, of whom Holmes says, “You see, Watson, but you do not observe!”  All we have to go on is what Watson tells us.  He sees well enough but, we feel, he sees no more than we would see, should we be so fortunate as he, accompanying Holmes on his adventures.  No fool, Watson.  A good, stout, dependable man, a brave and loyal friend.  Neither he nor we can hope to be as brilliant as Holmes but we can do our best to live up to the example Watson sets for us; we can strive to emulate his sturdy qualities.\r\n\r\nWell, there is an air of mystery about this music.  Suspense, even.  A little.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each story, as with the coda of a well-crafted piece of music, comes closure.  The mystery is explained and solved;  Holmes methods are revealed.  Justice is served.  \r\n\r\nWe demand that fiction ends with a sense of closure and we demand no less of music.  When the music stops, we must feel that the expression is complete, that the ideas presented at the beginning have been sufficiently developed and explored, that a decisive and final conclusion has been reached, that nothing remains to be said.  \r\n\r\nAchieving closure in music is a tricky business; I am at a loss to say how it is done.  I could not advise a young composer on how to fashion a sense of closure at the end of a piece of music.  All I can say is that I know it when I hear it.  Instinct, I suppose, for want of a better word, is what enables a composer to know just when and how to end a piece….  \r\n\r\n	… and just when and how to end a little email essay like this one.\r\n\r\nTo hear violinist Laura Bossert and cellist Terry King playing the Waltz from my Convivial Suite, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nApr. 30, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 1, 2016\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHello everybody -- \r\n\r\nAs I write this, I''m imagining all of you sitting here with me in our little living room.  It''s a heart warming thought, but of course you''d never fit.  Reminds me of the old joke:\r\n\r\n"Will you join me in a cup of tea?"\r\n\r\n"We''d never fit!"\r\n\r\nha.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of jokes, today I''m inviting you to listen to violinist Laurie Bossert and cellist Terry King playing the "March" movement from a suite I wrote specifically for them, entitled "Convivial Suite."\r\n\r\nI''m going for humor here.  It''s intended to be funny.  Not laugh-out-loud, slap-your-knee, bend-over funny.  Just a short piece that warrants a short chuckle.\r\n\r\nTime was, humor was a regular feature of concert music.  Haydn''s works are full of funny touches.  But as Romanticism climaxed in the 19th century and current events grew so overwhelmingly grim in the 20th century, humor as a device in ''serious'' music was abandoned.\r\n\r\nOh, here and there you find some ironic humor in Prokofiev, bitter humor in Shostakovich, broad American humor in Charles Ives.  But that''s about it.\r\n\r\nThen comes Peter Schickele, a.k.a. PDQ Bach, a composer who has made humor his centerpiece.   I make no bones about it:  Schickele is my favorite living American composer.  The man''s a genius, albeit a comic genius.\r\n\r\nThis March for violin and cello isn''t nearly as funny as Schickele''s best stuff, but it prompts a chuckle.  The Convivial Suite features seven movements and six of them are light and funny.  One, the second-to-last, is tragic and deeply felt;  I put it there to contrast with the other movements, to serve as a respite from chuckling.\r\n\r\nMost of the humor in this recording comes from the way the musicians play the music.  All those little glissandi, bows bouncing on strings, the sudden extreme louds and softs, particularly the very last two notes of the piece, the first very loud, the last extremely soft.  Funny!\r\n\r\nThe tunes are original but there''s a section about 3/4 through that always sounds to me like a quotation from "Won''t You Come Home, Bill Bailey?"  -- the part where the words go:  "... with nothin'' but a fine tooth comb."   You might hear this, too.  Or you might not.  Either way it''s a fun piece and requires only 2 minutes, 9 seconds of your time.\r\n\r\nTo hear "March" from "Convivial Suite for violin and cello," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH  \r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nHappy Fourth of July weekend.  \r\n\r\nLast week’s email featured philosophy; this week humor is my intent. In any case, now and always, as Prospero says at the end of The Tempest, “my project was to please."\r\n\r\nFour American composers -- Charles Ives, Roy Harris, Samuel Barber and the undersigned --  have something in common (besides being composers who are American.)\r\n\r\nCan you guess what it is?  \r\n\r\nGreatness?  \r\n\r\nDon’t make me sigh.  I wish.\r\n\r\nIt’s this:  The spelling of our first and last names are readily discernible.  Hearing our names, even just once, almost any American could spell them correctly.\r\n\r\nIn our time, when millions are agog with googling, it’s handy for a composer to possess a name the correct spelling of which can be readily rendered.\r\n\r\nSay someone hears my music on the radio.  Curious, the listeners, bless their hearts, having experienced the name aurally and but never visually, can crank up a search engine and, in the ‘search'' field, type in what they think they heard:\r\n	\r\n						 s o - w a s h\r\n\r\nBingo!  Bull’s eye!  Pay-dirt!  Eureka!  Voilà!! \r\n\r\nO brave new world that has such gizmos in it.\r\n\r\nYet it all depends upon the listener/searcher being able to spell my name.  Easy!  That’s why it’s good to have a name that’s stupid-simple.  SO-wash.\r\n\r\nStephen Foster came close but people stumbled on the "ph."  He was adamant.  "Stop calling me Steve!” he would shout, pounding the table, making the old ladies jump.  “It''s STEPHEN, I tell you!  NOT STEVE!  STEPHEN!  With a PEE! and an AITCH!"  \r\n\r\nHis friends thought he was kidding.  "Take it easy, Steve," they would say, pouring him another mint julep.  It put him into a mental state which was nameless at the time, but which modern-day nerve specialists have termed ‘the Heebie-jeebies.’ \r\n\r\nAn American listener could go bonkers trying to google the Great Composers’ names if all he had to go by was the pronunciations he was hearing on the local classical music radio station.\r\n\r\nIf you didn’t know the spellings and only heard the names pronounced on the radio, how would YOU attempt to spell the following?\r\n\r\nHidin’ \r\nMoatsart\r\nBaytohvun\r\nShoomun\r\nShowpan\r\nBroms\r\nVahgner\r\nPoocheenee\r\nVairdee\r\nDuhvorzhacque\r\nClawed W.C.  \r\n\r\n(That last one makes me think of the damage a grizzly could wreak a British restroom:  to wit, a badly clawed WC).  \r\n\r\nWhen I was a radio broadcaster, we had fun with composer’s names.  We would deliberately follow a piece of music by Irving Fine with a piece by Vincent D’Indy.  That way, we could say, “Coming up in the next half hour, music by Fine and D’Indy."  (Fine and dandy, get it?)\r\n\r\nSame with Thomas Arne and Karl Orff.  “Coming up:  music by Arne and Orff.”  (On and off.)\r\n\r\nWell, now in my old age …. “as the days dwindle down to a precious few … "\r\n\r\n	(In case you don’t recognize it, that’s a quote from the morose popular ballad “September Song” …  remember?  \r\n\r\n	… then there’s that bit about “the sunburned hands I used to hold.”  What is with that line, by the way?  It makes me imagine her shouting, “Ouch!” and then, "Watch it, you idiot!  Can’t you see that my hands are sunburned?") … \r\n\r\nIt''s a comfort, in my old age, to know that radio listeners can more readily google the names of Ives, Harris, Barber and Sowash than those of almost any other composers.  \r\n\r\nIn that one respect, among composers, we’re tied for first place:  Charlie, Roy, Sam and me.\r\n\r\nFunny.  \r\n\r\nTo hear something funny, take in violinist Laura Bossert and cellist Terry King playing the Finale from my Convivial Suite, by clicking on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJuly 2, 2017\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),35);

Walton seems to have invented it.  I like to think of him, quill pen in hand, script paper on the writing desk before him, running his fingers through his hair, rummaging through the fusty corners of his mind, seeking a generic word to summarize the plenitude of sundries, trifles, trinkets, gewgaws and knick-knacks he had envisioned.  Finding no suitable word, he wastes no more time; he makes up a great one on the spot.  "Finimbrun!"  Writers could get away with such things in 1653.  For my money, it''s a mighty fine word, even if it has never achieved widespread usage.  \r\n\r\nWalton’s telling has a charm all its own; his word-strings have a rickety, mock-stately, skimble-shanked, hobble-dehoy rhythm.  You’d think it was a parody of 17th-century prose if you didn’t know that 17th-century prose is precisely what it is.  Delightful to the eye when read, it''s not entirely felicitous for singing.  When I set the anecdote to music I made apologies to Walton’s shade and trimmed the text, thus:\r\n\r\n	“One day Diogenes walked with a friend to a country fair.  And there he saw ribbons and snuff boxes and looking glasses and bird cages and all the other finimbruns which go to make up a country fair.  And he said, “Lord, how many things there are in this world of which Diogenes hath no need.”\r\n\r\nHaving surgically reduced the paragraph to its bones, I fleshed it out again by having the choristers repeat words and phrases.  “Diogenes!” they sing, eight times over, right off the bat, a fanfare to introduce the main character and capture your attention before the anecdote begins.  The repetitions continue throughout, with humorous effect, developing at length into the little fugue that starts on the bottom of page nine.\r\n\r\nA fugue, mind you!  Music doesn''t get more 17th-century than that!  The ultimate flowering of canonic repetition.  \r\n\r\nWhen the last line is reached and we are waiting to hear what the philosopher, afloat in flood of finimbruns, will have to say, the music — appropriately, on the word “Lord,” — suddenly turns solemn, even hymn-like.  We’re expecting an expression of gratitude.  Maybe Diogenes will say something like, “What a piece of work is man, who can devise so fantastic a farrago of, of, of … well, finimbruns!”   \r\n\r\nBut no.  We’re talking about Diogenes after all, the Groucho of his time and place. \r\n\r\n“How many things there are in this world,” he says, "of which Diogenes … hath … no … need!"\r\n\r\nHa, ha!\r\n\r\nMay our lives be free of — or, if we prefer, favored by — finimbruns!\r\n\r\nTo hear the celebrated choral conductor Gregg Smith leading his Gregg Smith Singers in an exuberant rendition of "The Country Fair,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nAugust 2, 2015\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),164);

But the sound approached more rapidly than dogs can run.  Eyes straining, I peered into the underbrush, expecting the first of these high-speed dogs to burst through any second.  Half-panicked, I half-twisted myself around, ready to run at the sight of them.\r\n\r\nThen something overhead caught my eye.  I looked up and saw — for the first time in my life — a flock of Canada Geese flying in V-formation above the hillsides of Bellville, Ohio, where I lived at the time.  I had mistaken their raucous squawking for the sound of berserk barking.  It was 1976 and Canada geese, once nearly extinct, were beginning to rebound.\r\n\r\nIt’s difficult to believe today, but for the first quarter century of my life I never saw Canada geese.  They did not exist in Ohio.  Today, they are found wherever there is water.  They’re so abundant that they present an unsavory problem.  As David Letterman said, “They evacuate but they don’t leave!”\r\n\r\nAll the same, seeing them in flight is a thrill.  The V-formation of geese in flight seems the very essence of The North.  It’s as powerfully suggestive of the vast majesty of this continent as the canoeing song, “Our Paddles Keen and Bright,” which Frank Culp, our Scoutmaster, taught us back in my Boy Scouting days.  He told us the Voyageurs had sung this song as they canoed the endless regions between the Great Lakes and Hudson’s Bay.\r\n\r\nYears later, now an adult volunteer on a High Adventure excursion for older Scouts, I sang that song again, paddle in hand, canoeing the lakes of Ontario’s Algonquin Provincial Park.  I was in the bow and Dick “Grippy” Ferrell, my oldest friend — he was my patrol leader when I joined Scouts in 1961 at the age of 11 — was in the stern.  We sang it loudly as we splashed along by day, we sang it reverently round the campfire by night … \r\n\r\n"Our paddles keen and bright\r\nFlashing like sliver\r\nSwift as the wild goose flight,\r\nDip, dip and swing."\r\n\r\nMy Trio #12 for clarinet, cello and piano is subtitled “Voyageurs:  Homage to Canada.”  The opening movement is entitled “Geese in Flight.”  \r\n\r\nIt begins with a musical depiction of geese flying in V-formation.  The skittery cello and raucous piano energetically declaim an E flat; the cello quickly descends, step-wise, while the piano ascends at the same pace, creating the effect of a widening V-shape.\r\n\r\nThen comes “Our Paddles Keen and Bright,” played in the lowest register of the cello, as if the song is rising from the pure, cold depths of Algonquin''s lakes.\r\n\r\nThe clarinet enters with the first three notes of Max Steiner''s main theme from “How the West Was Won,” a motif that, for me, still resonates with heroism and spaciousness.\r\n\r\nThese three musical figures — the V-shape, “Our Paddles” and Steiner''s three-note motif — are developed as the movement unfolds, made into little fugues, expanded, overlapped.  \r\n\r\nThe V-shape is heard four times.  The last time, at the end of the movement, it is played in reverse, the outer notes converging, narrowing until they reach the same E flat that began the movement, to suggest the flock disappearing in the distance. \r\n\r\nThis music has never been professionally recorded;  very few have heard it.

I tried to make each of them beautiful in their own way, but BEAUTY, as such, was rarely the Thing I was trying to achieve.  Only three or four were written with BEAUTY as the sole intent.\r\n\r\nOne of these is linked to this message (see below) and I hope you''ll listen to all 5 minutes and 16 seconds of it.  It is very nearly the most beautiful music I''ve written, yet it has been performed only twice and never professionally recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is "Starshadows on Snow," the third movement of my Trio #12 for clarinet, cello and piano, written in 2003, subtitled "Voyageurs:  Homage to Canada."\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the entire work, here are the titles of all four movements:\r\nI.  Geese in Flight\r\nII.  Song of the Voyageurs\r\nIII.  Starshadows on Snow\r\nIV.  A Majestic Land\r\n\r\nThe third movement depicts a boreal forest on a still, clear, moonless night, the starlight sifting faintly through bare, black branches, casting delicate, blue-gray shadows on the twinkling snow.\r\n\r\nThe cello opens the movement with a tentative, rising figure; the figure ascends to the clarinet and ascends from there to those tinkling keys in the highest register of the piano.  Listen for the star music there, a gentle, poignant, descending pattern.  \r\n\r\nThis music always brings to mind one of Shakespeare''s most beautiful lines:  \r\n\r\n		"Look how the floor of Heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold!"  \r\n\r\nThen comes the tune, played by the cello.  It begins with an octave leap upward, as when we turn our faces starward, then slowly, softly drifts down, like starlight blanketing a winterscape.  Four times the tune is heard, each with a different texture and treatment, the last a hymn of thanksgiving.  The piano, again in its highest register, whispers the final measures.  It''s very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere is a minor challenge awaiting you, I regret to say.  Unlike the other mp3s I''ve shared with you in recent weeks, this is not a professional recording.  It was performed by pretty good amateur musicians in a church but recorded with only just adequate sound equipment.  Please try to hear past the technical quality; it is rough in places and never great.  Hearing past the technical quality is a skill unto itself, like perceiving what is good about a play despite the flaws of a particular production or savoring what is good in a novel despite a scattering of aggravating typos.\r\n\r\nI''ve produced fifteen CDs of my music over the past 24 years but many fine pieces, like this one, have not yet been professionally recorded.

Let me try to explain it.\r\n\r\nTonal music has a tonal center, a home-base note;  pieces end on that note, making listeners feel they''ve arrived home safely at the end of a piece.  It''s the note at the end that says, "Closure."  Music theorists call this note "the tonic."  \r\n\r\nThe tonic has a certain feel to it, a musical metaphor expressing centered-ness.  \r\n\r\nIn this piece, the third note you''ll hear is the tonic, sung on the word "still."  The words go "Be still," the tune starting beneath the tonic on the word "Be" and then rising up to the tonic on the word "still."  Next the words go, again, "Be still," only this time the tune begins above the tonic on the word "Be" and then settles down to the tonic, arriving, again, on the word "still."\r\n\r\nThe third phrase of the piece starts once again beneath the tonic on the word "Be," rises to the tonic and then soars to notes higher than we''ve heard so far.\r\n\r\nSee the metaphor?  "Stillness," the music is saying, is found on the tonic.  The tonic is where the stillness is, musically, just as God is where the stillness is, theologically.  And with stillness, the music says as it soars, comes the assurance that God is God, that we don''t need to worry or fear, that the universe is not in our control and that is as it should be.\r\n\r\nThis is a comforting thought.  The piece calms me, too.  When I am stuck in traffic or standing stock-still in a long line at the post office, bank or grocery, I softly sing this piece to myself, over and over, until things start to move.  It works!\r\n\r\nYou''ll hear the tune three times (three = Trinity).  First, in unison.  Then in canon (half the choir sings the tune a few notes behind the other half).

The skills and experiences that prove effective in one of these two hemispheres are generally less valuable in the other.  \r\n\r\nMost composers seem to choose one of these hemispheres as their dwelling place, occasionally visiting the other.\r\n\r\nThere is communication between the two hemispheres as, for example, when teachers of instruments tell their students to “make it sing.”  Or when choral directors prod choristers to make instrumental effects, such as staccato or legato.\r\n\r\nBut the two hemispheres are separated chiefly by the presence or absence of words.  \r\n\r\nWords are the singer’s bane, a challenge of which instrumentalists know nothing.  Singers must often struggle with vowels that pinch the voice and with consonants that simply cannot be sung.  Try singing an “S” or a “J.”  Or a word like “which.”  You will quickly see the challenge and understand why listeners often find it difficult to understand a text that is being sung, which is why texts are often printed in concert programs or church bulletins.\r\n\r\nSung words have specific meanings which the singers must respect, express, convey.  Blessed are the instrumentalists! — for they make music with no such concerns.\r\n\r\nOf course, singers don’t have to sing words.  Vocal music can be wordless.  A composer can ask singers to intone no other sound than “ahhh” or “oooh.”  Think of the vocalises by Rachmaninoff and Villa Lobos or the wordless women’s chorus in Debussy’s Sirènes.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Alleluia.  Four lovely vowels.  An affirmation, yes, but only vaguely meaningful for most folks.  What does the word mean?  Well, it’s an adaptation into English of the Hebrew phrase “hallalu-ya” which means “praise ye Jehovah."\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Lexington Junior High School in 1962, my 7th grade choir & general music teacher, Roderick Evans, started me composing when, having noticed me messing around on the piano before class began, coaxed me into writing a little Alleluia.\r\n\r\n“What’s an Alleluia,” I asked.  “It’s a piece of music where the choir sings that one word, ‘Alleluia,’ over and over again and then, at the end, they sing ‘Amen’ and that’s it.  When you get home after school, fool around on the piano and, tomorrow, bring me four notes, one for each syllable: Al-le-lu-ia.”  I did as he asked.  He said my four notes were good and he suggested what should come next.  Within a few weeks I had written my first real piece of music (actually, he did most of the work, as I hadn''t yet mastered music notation) and Mr. Evans led our choir in the premiere performance in the school''s annual spring concert.  It was a big deal for me.  I’ve been composing music ever since.\r\n\r\nYears later, in 2000, I returned to the Alleluia, writing for our Mt. Auburn Presbyterian Church’s chancel choir here in Cincinnati.  It’s a two-part canon, a melody sung by the combined sopranos and altos, the combined tenors and basses echoing the melody alwys a measure behind.  Our director, my good friend Chris Miller, had the choir stand in a ring around the sanctuary, surrounding the seated congregation, rendering the piece ‘stereophonically.’  ‘Surround-sound’ in church!

The irony is obvious:  our land is peopled almost entirely by immigrants and by the descendants of immigrants, all of whom were The Other, once upon a time.\r\n\r\nThe challenge this presents our country is a subject that is too big for me.  \r\n\r\nI’m only qualified to comment on one tiny, trivial aspect of the subject:  the challenge our immigrant heritage poses for an American composer.   \r\n\r\nTo write authentic music, American composers must know who they are, where they are and where they come from.  They must figure out how to express and extend these realities, musically, in the America of their own time.\r\n\r\nMy father''s ancestors were French.  Johannes Sauvage arrived in Boston in 1737.  (The origin of “Sowash” is the French family name “Sauvage.”)   During the American Revolution, his grandsons served in the Continental Army.   Our family had long since ceased speaking French by the time I came along.  I learned the language in college, improving my skills in subsequent visits to France.  I have found much to admire in French culture and I love to think of "la belle France" as the land of my ancestors.  For two-and-a-half years now, I’ve been joyfully teaching French to young people.  Some of my music sounds a little French-y.  \r\n\r\nMy mother''s parents were Austro-Hungarians, from what is called Serbia today, though they considered themselves Germans, not Serbs.   They arrived in Crestline, Ohio around 1900.  My great-grandmother, Sophia Hoff, quickly learned that if she wore her beautiful headscarf in public she would be treated very badly.  Her son, my grandfather, John Hoff, was relentlessly beaten up at school until he learned enough English and mustered the courage to stand up for himself.  I heard these stories, growing up, along with contrasting stories of how the kindness and compassion of some neighbors and teachers helped the family.  I heard a lot of German as a boy, picking up the rhythm and music of the language along with a few words and phrases.  When Jo and I visited Austria the language came back to me pretty quickly.  Sure enough, some of my works have an Eastern European sound.\r\n\r\nYet I am neither French nor German-Serbian.  I am American and my music has an American sound, identifying me accordingly.   \r\n\r\nI wrote my clarinet quintet in response to some of the European musical structures.  Think of the four movements as four glasses, made in Europe, each with a different shape, each filled with American wine.  \r\n\r\nThe last movement of the quintet is my take on Brahms’ Hungarian Dances, my attempt to extend that very Austro-Hungarian genre into a contemporary American context.\r\n\r\nThe resulting music sounds … how shall I term it? … Austro-Hungarian-American?

It had to have been written sometime after about 1930 because it has an identifiably American sound, a style of musical expression that didn’t exist until about then.  \r\n\r\nThe music is also somewhat outside the familiar song genres.

I’ll return to the full moon and Diana, I promise!\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite films is “Enchanted April.”  In a telling scene, near the beginning, Lottie’s husband tells her that they’ve been invited to a party.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she says, squirming, “but there will be artists there.  I never know what to say to artists.”\r\n\r\n“Praise them!” he says, with the air of a man who knows what he’s talking about.  “Just praise them!” he repeats.  “You can’t go wrong!”\r\n\r\nHa!  He’s right!  Let’s admit it.  Artists yearn to be praised; his advice is both funny and apt.\r\n\r\nYet the whole truth is not so flip.  Praise is all well and good for anyone, but what artists need most, especially young artists, is to connect with someone who takes them seriously.\r\n\r\nDo you know a young artist?  A painter, a poet, a writer, a composer?  Take them seriously;  engage with them; ask them about the creative work they’re doing, just now.  \r\n\r\nHow grateful I am to the handful of wonderful musicians who took  me seriously, early on, by engaging with my music in ways that went far beyond performance.  They inspired me, they asked me to write new works specially for them; they absorbed my music and made suggestions that rendered it more effective.  They taught me so much; they raised me to levels I could not have reached by myself.  \r\n\r\nAmong these musicians have been cellist Terry King, clarinetist Angelo Santoro, choral directors Chris Miller, Kevin Kelly and Gregg Smith.  And mezzo-soprano Diane Haslam.\r\n\r\nDiane once asked for songs she could sing with a flutist friend as well as a pianist.  Her first name being the English derivation of Diana, Goddess of the Moon, I thought of setting Walter De La Mare''s wonderful little poem about moonlight entitled, “Silver."\r\n\r\nThe flute itself is silver in color and it makes a silvery sound.  In other poems by De La Mare, I found that the word “silver” frequently recurred.  For Diane, I wrote a cycle of five short songs, setting five of his poems, all of which featured the word, “silver.” \r\n\r\nTake a moment and read “Silver."\r\n\r\nSlowly, silently, now the moon\r\nWalks the night in her silver shoon;\r\nThis way, and that, she peers, and sees\r\nSilver fruit upon silver trees;\r\nOne by one the casements catch\r\nHer beams beneath the silvery thatch;\r\nCouched in his kennel, like a log,\r\nWith paws of silver sleeps the dog....\r\nA harvest mouse goes scampering by,\r\nWith silver claws, and silver eye;\r\nAnd moveless fish in the water gleam,\r\nBy silver reeds in a silver stream.\r\n\r\n“Shoon” is quaint and sweetly affected but “moveless" stops my breath.  Only a genius could conceive and position in precisely the right place a word so improbable yet so perfect.\r\n\r\nMusic can never be ‘moveless.’  It moves through time, sometimes moves us emotionally.  Still I did my best to write a “moveless” song.  See what you think …\r\n\r\nHow beautifully Diane Haslam sang my Silvery Songs.  I regret we never recorded her renditions.

Duration: 3:07.\r\n\r\nHere are the words, slightly adapted from Jerome''s original text:\r\n\r\n	"Let your boat of life be light, packed with only what you need: a homely home and simple pleasures, a cat, a dog, and a pipe or two and enough to eat and enough to wear and more than enough to drink. [And] someone to love and someone to love you. Someone to share the time to watch the glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, shining lightly on the shallows, golden leaves, mossy trees, cattails, rushes and 		the joyful lilies, white and yellow.  Let your boat of life be light...”  \r\n\r\nWhat makes the opening canon sound so light?  Avoidance of the tonic.  The opening hovers around the dominant and as the tune flows along, rippling up and down, it only just grazes the tonic (the tonal center of the piece, in this case an E flat).  This gives the music a heady, lighter-than-air feeling; the singers and listeners have the sensation of floating through the piece ... like the three men in a boat (to say nothing of the dog).\r\n\r\nWhen you click the link below you''ll hear the piece enthusiastically sung by the Chancel Choir of the Mt.

Also the TV westerns I grew up watching:  Wagon Train, Bonanza, The Rifleman, Gunsmoke.  \r\n\r\nTo my generation, those themes are what The West sounds like.\r\n\r\nThose scores have an expansive sweep, a galloping excitement; they evoke high-spirited adventure and the feel of wide-open spaces,  My challenge was to capture a little of all that in a work scored for just three humble instruments.\r\n\r\nLike a ‘good guy’ in a cowboy movie, I did my best.  \r\n\r\nThe five movements I came up with were inspired by five photographs of Mt. Emily, the most prominent feature of the landscape near LaGrande, OR, the trio’s home town.  The photos were the work of Carol Haddock, sister of Elizabeth Cooper, the trio’s pianist.  The titles Carol selected for her photographs also serve as the titles for my five movements.\r\n\r\nWhen the third piece, "Here Comes Spring," was finished, I quietly announced, “My work here is done.”  \r\n\r\nAs I rode off, the musicians asked one another, “Who was that man?”  \r\n\r\nA puzzled pause ensued.  \r\n\r\nFinally, one of them said, “Why, that was The Lone Composer.”\r\n\r\n“Heigh-yo, Silver!

It''s one of life’s great pleasures.\r\n\r\nStill, twenty minutes is enough.  Much longer and this great pleasure turns irksome.\r\n\r\nHappiness is not like that.  For one thing, you know right away when something is pleasurable but oftentimes you don’t realize how happy you were until you look back.  In fact, in my experience, it’s rare to be totally happy and to KNOW, at that very moment, that you ARE totally happy.  I can count on one hand the number of such moments I’ve experienced. \r\n\r\nOne came last December, when I took a bow after the superb and, for me, unforgettable, performance of my cantata, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, by the Harvard-Radcliffe Community Chorus.  \r\n\r\nWhen the last note sounded and the conductor motioned me to join the performers on the stage, I leapt to my feet, rushed forward, embraced the soloists, shook the conductor’s hand and took my bow.  I was so happy that I found myself lifting my hands and eyes upward though I can’t explain exactly why.  I could not stop smiling, though there were tears in my eyes.  \r\n\r\nIt was one of the supremely happy moments of my life, right up there with the day I was married and the days on which our two children entered the world, healthy and whole.  \r\n\r\nAll this begs the question, what do we mean when we use that word “happy”?\r\n\r\n“Happiness,” Aristotle said, “is the exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope.”\r\n\r\nThat’s a muscular, dynamic definition, primal, Greek, Western.  No mention of our duty to God or humble service to others or letting go of selfish desires or opting for love instead of power.\r\n\r\nFor an aspiring Christian like myself, Aristotle’s is definition is incomplete, though galvanizing.  It has served me well and I commend it to others.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, on the last day of the school year in the school where I teach (in addition to four levels of French, I also teach courses in Music Theory, and the Art of Storytelling), I wrote Aristotle’s definition on the blackboard and challenged the students to ponder it, to ask themselves how it applied to them, how they measured their own notions of happiness against it.\r\n\r\n“What are your vital powers?” I asked them.  “Some of mine are music, writing, storytelling and teaching."\r\n\r\n“Once you’ve discovered your vital powers,” I said, "exercise them!  Learn all you can about the fields of action where such powers are in play.  Find someone who has mastered the skills required to join in the play and ask that person to teach you what they know.\r\n\r\n"Practice your vital powers along lines of excellence, doing the best you can.  When you do the best you can, even if you fail, as you sometimes will, you can look back and say, ‘Well, at least I did the best I could.’  This will be a great comfort.  It has been for me.\r\n\r\n“What does Aristotle mean by ‘scope?’  He means you’ve got to create for yourself an adequately large field of action for your talents.  It’s not enough to simply do you own thing as best you can, all by yourself in some obscure corner. You’ve got to find an audience!  You’ve got to bring your gifts to ‘the world,’ whatever you understand that to mean."\r\n\r\nI don’t know how much they got out of all this but they were listening.  I could see it in their eyes.\r\n\r\nHow much scope DO we need to make us happy?  Aristotle can''t say because each of us must answer that question for ourselves.  \r\n\r\nScope is tricky.  One’s first thought would likely be:  “The more scope, the better!”\r\n\r\nBut it’s not that simple.  There were only three students in my most advanced French class this year.  Would my scope have been greater if there had been thirty?  or three hundred?  No.  In fact, greater numbers would have reduced the scope.\r\n\r\nWith just three students, I was able to work closely, helping them master the subtleties of pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar.  Three students gave me plenty of scope and I was very happy all year long.\r\n\r\nConsider the roster of recipients for these emails you kindly permit me to send your way each week.  Three-and-a-half years ago I started by sending them to about a hundred friends and fans.  These recipients sometimes forwarded the emails to others who subsequently signed up to receive them.  \r\n\r\nThe total number of recipients has grown to six hundred.\r\n\r\nThe scope has increased numerically but my happiness in sharing these messages has neither increased nor decreased.  I am just as happy sharing them now with six hundred as I was when I shared them with one hundred.  I still think of y’all as a small group of friends.  And if the number would grow to six thousand, I would be no happier, I know, than I am, right now, writing this message for you.  \r\n\r\nThe right amount of scope is in the eyes of the beholder and each of us must decide for ourselves how much scope is enough to render us happy.\r\n\r\nBut enough philosophizing.  Let’s listen to some happy music!\r\n\r\nTo hear “Good Morning, Miss Emily,” the opening movement of my Trio #4 for violin, clarinet and piano, subtitled “Images of Mt.

An English professor, the star of our bass section, seized the moment to reveal his knowledge of the real names of authors better known by their pen names:  George Eliot, Saki, Lewis Carroll, O.Henry, George Orwell.  \r\n\r\nThe imp on my left shoulder prompted me to ask him if he knew Walt Whitman’s real name.  Caught off guard, his eyes jerked left and right as he ran a quick search through his gray cells and came up short.  “No,” he said, “I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, a little ashamed of myself for baiting the good man, “his real name was …. \r\n\r\n								Walter!”\r\n\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nOne day, just over a half century ago, I pulled a fat, thick book from a shelf in my high school’s library.  It was titled “Leaves of Grass.”  “Blades of Grass” would have made sense.  But leaves?  Grass doesn’t come in leaves.  So what was this book?\r\n\r\nI might have wondered how anyone could write such a long book about various strains of grass.  Fifteen years old, I knew nothing about the book, had never heard of its famous title.  \r\n\r\nEven when I opened it, I didn’t at first realize that it was a book of poetry.  I grew up hearing a lot of poems read aloud to me by my grandfather and by my mother, poems like “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” “The House With Nobody In It,” “The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,” and “The Village Blacksmith.”  \r\n\r\nThe writing in Leaves of Grass was nothing like those poems.  Most of the sentences were very long and none of them, so far as I could see, ended the way I thought lines of poetry were supposed end:  with a word that rhymes with the end of the line that comes right before it.   \r\n\r\nIn the table of contents I spotted a section oddly entitled “Song of Myself.”  Was this a song book?  I flipped through.  Nope.  There was no music notation anywhere in it.  \r\n\r\nI sat down and started reading “Song of Myself.”  I remember my growing amazement.  “Who IS this man, this Walt Whitman?” I wondered.  “How could one person ever BE all these things?  Is he really talking about his actual self? or is he talking about the self of someone he’s made up?  Or is he just bragging that he’s done all these things when he really hasn’t done any of them?"\r\n\r\nI vaguely wondered if “myself” meant something different to this Walt Whitman than the word meant to me.  Reading “Song of Myself” was baffling but intriguing.  It made me wonder about all sorts of things.  The main thing I felt was amazement.\r\n\r\nI am no longer much-ly amazed by most of the things that amazed me much-ly when I was fifteen.  But I am still amazed by Walt Whitman.  Much-ly!\r\n\r\nI love his long, long poems …\r\n\r\nUncle Walt (as a friend calls him, and I like that moniker) gave us a good many long poems  but he gave us many wonderful short poems, too, marvels of truth and simplicity.  \r\n\r\nHere comes one.\r\n\r\nWinter has just drawn to its close, and Uncle Walt, out for a walk, sees a dandelion “emerging,” the first he’s seen that year.  Could there be a humbler topic for a poem?  See, just see, what he finds to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n	The First Dandelion\r\n\r\n	Simple and fresh and fair, from winter''s close emerging, \r\n	As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics had ever been,\r\n	Forth from its sunny nook of shelter''d grass, \r\n	Innocent, golden, calm as the dawn, \r\n	The spring''s first dandelion shows its trustful face.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poem opens its trustful face, asks only that we return its gaze.  It is immediately and entirely comprehensible.  It does not ask us to search for hidden meanings.  The poem, like the dandelion, is right there in front of you, "simple and fresh and fair."  The poem and the dandelion are quietly going about their business; they mean precisely themselves, nothing more, \r\n\r\nFor Uncle Walt, that’s miracle enough.\r\n\r\nCould a piece of music be so clean?  Using only musical sounds, could a composer emulate that poem, that dandelion?  \r\n\r\nI tried many a time over the next fifty years, as when I wrote “Morning," the opening movement of my Trio #10 for clarinet, cello and piano, “Winds of May.”  (The other movements are entitled “Dark Forest,” “Wildflowers” and “Sunset.”)\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing “Morning," the opening movement of Trio #10, “Winds of May,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nMay 7, 2017\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),50);

The one who never lingers, never pauses, is the implied Weaver, not us.\r\n\r\nThe music, too, is far from suggesting frenetic activity; it is meditative, wistful, radiant, hypnotic.

There are more impressive national parks and we’ve explored many of them; but none has a stronger claim on my affection than the Shenandoah National Park.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 32, my wife and I, mindful of the song and park, named our daughter Shenandoah.  Still later, we learned the meaning of this ancient, Native American word:  “Clear-eye’d Daughter of the Stars.”  That was what they called the river.\r\n  \r\nWhen I was 41, I wrote this Fantasia, paying homage to the beautiful valley, park and tune.  I scored it for string orchestra but since I couldn''t afford to hire a string orchestra to record it, I rescored it for string quartet and recorded that  version on my CD, "Music for the Appalachian Trail," a portion of the profits being donated to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.\r\n\r\nI like the string quartet version but it is thin compared to the richer sound I had in mind, the sound of a full string orchestra.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 60 I heard from an old friend, Tod Addison, now a Major in the US Army, sharing the news that he was soon to become the conductor of the symphony orchestra attached to the US Army Band.  He asked if I had any works for string orchestra!   Yes!  \r\n\r\nI sent him my Fantasia on Shenandoah.  He loved it.  Two years later he conducted the world premiere performance in Washington DC.   You may be sure I was there, in the front row, family in tow.\r\n\r\nBefore the performance, Tod had me give a short speech to the audience, describing how and why I wrote the piece.  Of course, I introduced our daughter, Shenandoah, by name, making her stand up and amaze the crowd with her bright smile and dazzling blond curls!  You can''t miss an opportunity like that!  I suspect she’d have preferred to remain seated but she was a good sport about it.  After the performance, I took a bow and then ate my share of cookies at the reception.  That was a happy day!\r\n\r\nSo I was 62 when I finally heard the piece played the way I had imagined it, exactly 50 years after hearing the song in the film score for “How The West Was Won.".\r\n\r\nIn the world of classical music, everything happens very, very slowly.  But the compensating factor is that the music itself never grows old.  We age, while music remains evergreen, even after hundreds of years, let alone the mere 21 years I had to wait to hear this piece performed.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the concert was recorded and Major Addison kindly sent me an mp3 afterwards.

When the eighth-notes are flowing steadily, alto Jane Carter enters with one of my folk-like tunes.  ("Folk-y but not hokey," is how Gregg Smith described my music.)  Next, the flute plays the opening phrase of the famous Doxology tune, also known as Old Hundred.  \r\n\r\nMore singing; the flute comes in again, this time with the second phrase of Old Hundre; more singing, then the flute plays the third phrase, then the fourth.  Finally the choir takes up the Old Hundred tune as the flute plays, in counterpoint, the folk-like tune Jane sang earlier.  \r\n\r\nThe famous Shaker tune, "Simple Gifts" is quoted at the very end.  \r\n\r\nThis recording was made when the choir sang in a concert of my vocal music.  At first, you''ll hear applause (for the piece we''d just sung), then the anthem, then more applause.  I mention that this recording was made in a concert  because applause is not usual in worship services.\r\n\r\nTo hear "Blessings Flow," click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nRick Sowash\r\nCincinnati, OH\r\nJune 15, 2014\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),7);

Airy Wedding Suite, like so many of my works, was written for friends.\r\n\r\nRand Wright has been my good friend since the 1970’s.  He is a remarkable fellow.  A superb graphic artist, he designed my website (see it for yourself:  www.sowash.com) and most of my books and CDs.  He is also a glider pilot, a self-taught classical guitarist, a loving husband and devoted father.  \r\n\r\nHis wife Michele is also a fine graphic artist and the creator of an original and unusual series of Nature books for children.  (See http://www.wrightdesignsbooks.com).  \r\n	 \r\nIn 1993 Randy asked me to compose a suite to be played at his wedding, which was to take place in Cincinnati’s beautiful Mt. Airy Park.  He specified only that it be scored for oboe, violin and cello — because he loves those instruments.  Since Randy particularly admires the music of the Baroque era, I composed the suite mostly in a style that might be termed “American Baroque.”  \r\n\r\nI say “mostly” because the second of the suite''s four movements, entitled “Romance,” is the exception, an antidote to the other three Baroque-ish movements.  As you would expect, the music is ‘romantic’ -- caressing, tender, lyrical.   \r\n\r\nThe oboe has the melody but the other two instruments are never merely accompanying the oboe’s tune, never merely filling out the harmonies.  Instead, they gently tug our attention away from the tune, with wistful little melodies of their own, always in counterpoint to what the oboe is doing.\r\n\r\nA wedding affirms mutual love, a public promise of enduring, mutual support.  I like to think that the strings in this movement are playing their parts in support of the oboe which, by ‘singing’ its lovely tune, provides the very reason why the strings should be playing at all.\r\n\r\nA metaphor for a successful marriage, wouldn’t you say?\r\n\r\nA suggested this:  I had a thought about your Romance:  the violin and cello voices are, indeed, so very important. I decided that they were the voices of the bride and bridegroom (kind of wondering around, a little lost, maybe), and that the oboe was the voice of the life they create together. \r\n\r\nTo hear the third movement, “Romance,” from my Mt.

Until healing comes, she’ll be in bad shape.\r\n\r\nMy dreadful president, elected in a bad Fall, daily inflicts multiple injuries on my dear causes, our suffering world.  We are miserable.  We face at least seventeen long months in a figurative cast / sling followed by many years of political therapy, trying to heal.  Until healing comes, we’ll be in bad shape.\r\n\r\nWhen crises beset me, here’s one thing I do:  I sing these words, to a tune of my own devising:  \r\n\r\n			“Be still and know that I am God.”\r\n\r\nIf you want to hear those comforting words sung to that tune right now by the Harvard Univ. Choir, copy and paste this link into your browser:  \r\nhttp://www.sowash.com/recordings/mp3/be_still.mp3\r\n\r\nAnother thing I sometimes do, when crises loom, is to imagine trees conversing.  \r\n\r\nWhat would they discuss?  The wind, the rain, the sun, the stars and the moon, the squirrels, chipmunks and birds, the passing seasons, the suppleness of their youth, the strength of their maturity, their eventual return to the soil.  Oh, and astonishment at how quickly the little saplings are growing up.\r\n\r\nBut the conversations of trees may be otherwise conceived.  Consider this:  save the flute, brass and percussion, musical instruments are made out of trees.\r\n\r\nThink of it!  Clarinets, cellos and pianos are mostly made of wood that was once, somewhere, a green-leafed, growing tree.  \r\n\r\nWhen ligneous instruments play together, their respective trees of origin share an  audible conversation!\r\n\r\nWhen my trios for clarinet, cello and piano are performed, humans are conversing through the trees from whence their instruments came!  \r\n\r\nThe clarinetist pushes breath past an Arundo donax reed, through a long cone carved from mpingo , African blackwood or grenadilla.  \r\n\r\nThe cellist draws a catgut bow across strings resonated by a shapely, polished box of maple, spruce, boxwood, willow or rosewood.  \r\n\r\nThe pianist directs felt hammers to strike taut strings that ring from the body of an instrument fashioned out of close-grained, quarter-sawn Sitka spruce.\r\n\r\nThink!  Just think!\r\n\r\nOur debt to trees is incalculable.  Music may be the least of the blessings they confer upon us.  The table on which my computer sits as I write these words, the chair upon which I sit, the floor upon which the chair sits — are entirely made of wood.  As are the hiking sticks of our youth and the canes and crutches of our old age.  As are our cradles, our bedposts, our coffins.  \r\n\r\nThe flotsam and jetsam of our lives are mostly made from wood:  pencils, paper sacks, cardboard boxes, matchsticks, trays, salad bowls, picture frames, cupboards, window sills, mopboards, crown moulding, turpentine.  \r\n\r\nWe are nourished and delighted by almonds, walnuts, apples, oranges, lemons, tangerines, maple syrup.\r\n\r\nPerhaps best of all, trees bless us with shade.  What have humans done for trees that they should shelter us with the blessing of shade?\r\n\r\nTrees enrich the very air we breathe, converting our exhalations of carbon dioxide into oxygen suitable for inhalation.  No breath?  No conversation, no singing.  Indeed, no life.  Forgive me for stating the obvious; sometimes the obvious needs to be articulated.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have to feed them; they flourish all by themselves.  Long before we achieved consciousness, trees figured out how to eat sunlight, a comparable achievement.\r\n\r\nDogs are well and good, but the best living allies we have on this planet are trees. \r\n\r\nTheir support is spiritual as well, even philosophical.  Like good parents, they teach us, not by verbal instruction but by noble example.  \r\n\r\n	"It is precisely in growing like a tree that we become ever more fully human -- that is, by solidifying the past into a support and structure for the present, and by adding every year a new ring of growth."\r\n\r\nI wish I could claim to have penned those wise, beautiful words.  I did not.  I plucked that sentence from a dendrophile’s memoir, The Cabin Down the Glen, by Odell Shepard.\r\n\r\nHere''s a bit more of the verbal magic he spins on the subject of trees: \r\n\r\n	“Twilight is falling in the glen.  Hues of pearl and amethyst are thrown back from every rock and twig and bole.  Every leaf reflects a ray from the deepening west.  The boughs where the shadows gather, the layered leaves, and all the expectant multitudes of the fern, are very still.  Once more the trees sink into meditation, groping down that endless road of thought or dream which claims them every night and all the winter long.  So still they are, so breathless, that one might think them carved in jade or painted in a picture.  They seem to be holding their breath to listen.”\r\n\r\nAre you listening?  It’s a moment for music.  Let’s listen to three trees conversing.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the opening movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nThere is a relationship, a rapport, between the clarinet and the cello that is unique among pairings of instruments.\r\n\r\nJust as the clarinet is the cello of the wind family, the cello is the clarinet of the string family.\r\n\r\nHearing them separately, you wouldn’t mistake one for the other.  But when just those two instruments play together, the relationship is consummated, a magical blending, the two become almost as one.  \r\n\r\nAs in a good marriage, each diminishes its individual identity in complementing the other; the sum is greater than the parts.  \r\n\r\nOur marriage is like that, to a degree that sometimes startles me, as when I realize that whatever opinion, feeling or reaction “I” might have, if I were merely an individual, is subsumed into the larger opinion, feeling or reaction that “we” have as a couple.\r\n\r\nWhat ‘BigTrips'' shall we venture upon in our remaining years?  If it was up to me alone, I’d go straight back to France.  Why go anywhere else?  But I’ve been there eight times already and Jo doesn’t speak French.  So I give slim odds to the possibility of returning to France, even though it remains my favorite country.  \r\n\r\nInstead I ask what Big Trips “we” would enjoy.  The British Isles, Vancouver Island, Crete, Alaska?  Shall we return to places we’ve discovered together:  Kauai, the Olympic peninsula, Tuscany, Cape May, Cumberland Island?\r\n\r\nThe wishes of “the one” remain dimly formed, easily dismissed, quickly forgotten.  The wishes of “the two” come clear and are eventually realized.\r\n\r\nAs Ovid says in his Metamorphoses, “We two form a multitude.”\r\n\r\nWell, the clarinet and the cello, when they play together, “form a multitude.”  \r\n\r\nOne coupling that forms that multitude is heard when the clarinet plays higher than the cello.  Another is when the cello plays the higher than the clarinet.  \r\n\r\nAnother sound, distinctly different, is when the cello plays its open D and A strings while the clarinet sounds the third of the chord, an F or an F sharp.  The sound is so unexpected that you would think that triad was being played by a third instrument.  \r\n\r\nThink how much the sounds of both those instruments change as they run their respective gamuts from their lowest registers to their highest.  Pair them low, pair them high, surprising new sounds are heard, new feelings evoked.  A multitude indeed.\r\n\r\nThe second movement of my Trio #4 for clarinet, cello and piano is scored for only the clarinet and cello; the piano is silent.\r\n\r\nThe solo clarinet begins, intoning a mysterious tune, pausing between phrases.  Listen carefully to what happens exactly 52 seconds in.  The cello enters and, for a little while, you’d almost think it was a second clarinet.\r\n\r\nFor me, this movement is a nocturne, the instruments susurrant, ‘au fond du bois,’ \r\nYou’ve heard the expression, “Once in a blue moon”?  This music is the once the blue moon is in.  \r\n\r\nAt the end, the two instruments seem to become aware of us, the listeners.  They whisper, "Hush!  We are observed!” … they stop, still as stones ... and as silent.\r\n\r\nAs my Trio #4 aspires to be a colloquy of trees, you’re invited to ponder this movement as a dialogue between the two trees that were harvested, carved and fashioned into this particular clarinet and cello.\r\n\r\nTo hear the second movement of my Trio #4 for clarinet, cello and piano, "Conversation of Trees,” played by clarinetist Laurel Bennett and cellist Teresa Villani, click on the link above. \r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning, a few years back, our pastor challenged us, mid-sermon, by asking and demanding the following:  \r\n\r\n“What gives you joy?  Turn to your neighbor in the pew — not your spouse or partner, someone else —  and tell them what gives you joy.”  \r\n\r\nI had never asked myself that question so directly but I immediately knew my answer.\r\n\r\n“What gives me joy,” I said to Jim Norman, my octogenarian friend and fellow tenor in the church choir, who happened to be seated next to me, “is making people smile.” \r\n\r\n“What gives me joy,” Jim said, in turn, “is singin'' in the choir, especially when we sing your music.”\r\n\r\nWriting this now, smiling, tears come to my eyes.  Jim is gone; he had a stroke and faded away.  I will remember our exchange for a long time.  It was a supreme compliment.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of prompting smiles, many sorts of smiles.  Wistful smiles, thoughtful smiles, grateful smiles, kindly smiles, even sad smiles.  In my music, my writings and my interactions with people, my aim is to elicit smiles.\r\n\r\nI try to be kind, to ask after others and to listen to their replies.  I’m not very good at it but I do my best.  As someone said, “Be kind because everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.”\r\n\r\nBeing funny is much easier.  I have a good memory and can usually pull out a quip to suit the occasion.\r\n\r\nLast Thursday night our church choir had just stumbled through a difficult piece, reading it for the first time, and I remembered a comment my high school band director made, forty years ago, after a similarly miserable reading.  I quoted it to the choir: “Well, as my high school band director said, you weren’t together but at least you were out of tune.”  It prompted a good laugh.\r\n\r\nWe usually associate humor with verbal wit or sight gags.  But music can be humorous, too.  A humorous piece of music?  What would THAT sound like?  It certainly would not be cast in a minor key, since everyone knows that music in a minor key is SAD.\r\n\r\nOh, really?  Not if it’s exuberantly self-mocking.  Let me give you an example.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the third movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nIf you listen to the music I want to share today, please be patient.  \r\n\r\nIt begins darkly.  Gloomily even!  You might say to yourself, “Whoa!  With bad news pounding us from all directions, who needs THIS?”  \r\n\r\nBe patient.  It’s a set-up!  There’s a very big surprise, unmistakbly American, that pops as soon the piano enters, precisely 2 minutes and 27 seconds after the movement begins!\r\n\r\nBut first, a few thoughts ...\r\n\r\nAlmost everything you are likely to hear at a concert of ‘classical’ music in an American concert hall or on an American classical music radio station was written by composers from nations that were, or aspired to be, empires during the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Is it an accident that almost all of the composers we hear performed live or broadcast  just happen to have come from those countries?\r\n\r\nConsider ...\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian empire’s capital was Vienna, in its day the most important city, musically, in the world.  It gave us Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Mahler.\r\n\r\nMy beloved France:  Debussy, Ravel, Saint-Saens, Gounod, Franck, Chopin, Berlioz.    \r\n\r\nRussia:  Tchaikovsky (the most frequently performed of all ‘classical’ composers -- did you know that?), Rimsky-Korsakof, Borodin, Glazounov, Mussorgsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Stravinsky.  \r\n\r\nGreat Britain:  Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Finzi, Britten.\r\n\r\nThe little countries around the edges of these Great Powers are, seemingly, each allowed one or two ‘great’ composers.  None of them are performed as frequently as the Big Names from the Imperial countries.  \r\n\r\nFinland?  Sibelius.\r\n\r\nNorway?  Grieg.\r\n\r\nDenmark?  Nielsen.\r\n\r\nSpain?  de Falla.  Maybe Granados.\r\n\r\nThe former Czechoslovakia?  Dvorak and Smetana.\r\n\r\nItaly?  Verdi and Puccini.\r\n\r\nI know a thing or two about music but I cannot name a single composer from Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg.  I cannot name a single composer from the Western Hemisphere (unless they are from my own country, of course).  Nor from Africa, Asia or Oceania.  How many composers from those continents can you name?  Not one?  Me neither.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?  I think it’s because there is a consensus among American conductors, musicians, radio program directors and academics -- and, yes, listeners -- that, when it comes to ‘high culture,’ we train a colonial mentality by accepting the notion that the old imperial European powers “really know” and that we, out here in their former colonies, must bow to their judgment.\r\n\r\nHow does America fit into this scenario?  We have exported our pop music but relatively little ‘classical’ music.  My French musician friends know Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” and Bernstein’s “Candide Overture” and that’s about it.  Name Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Virgil Thomson, Randall Thompson, Roy Harris, Ferde Grofé or Charles Ives and they shake their heads.\r\n\r\nWe’ve exported plenty of pop culture, to be sure.  Hollywood, Elvis Presley, Rock, Jazz.  Some of it is good stuff, some of it is tripe.  But I have often been surprised by how little my French friends know about ‘serious’ American artists.  One friend, a very bright woman, a retired teacher, assured me that she had never heard of Mark Twain or "Huckleberry Finn."  I began to quiz her, trying to discern what she knew about ‘serious’ American artists.  She knew “Whistler’s Mother,” having seen it in the Musée d’Orsay, but she had no knowledge of “American Gothic.”  She knew about Hemingway and Gertrude Stein, since they had lived in and written about Paris, but knew nothing of Emerson or Thoreau, Melville or Hawthorne.  She had heard the name “Walt Whitman” but had read nothing he’d written.\r\n\r\nLet’s return to music.  Are we to believe that compositional genius just happens to be limited to countries with imperial ambitions?  Really?  Can there be no great composers of ‘concert music'' from, say, Trinidad, Taiwain, Crete, Iceland, Viet Nam, Croatia, Corsica or … dare I say it?  Ohio?\r\n\r\nConlusion:  classical music appears to be rigged, a word we often hear nowadays.\r\n\r\nHow shall an American composer respond?\r\n\r\nWe could imitate the Great European Masters.  Been tried and it don’t work (sic).\r\n\r\nOr we could simply BE American and let the chips fall.  That’s the case with the music I want to share with you today, a gumbo no European could have concocted.  \r\n\r\nThat’s why I made bold to say, at the beginning of this message, that the music I want to share today boasts an unmistakably AMERICAN surprise at precisely 2:27.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the fourth movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click here:\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶\r\n\r\nBack in August, when I shared the first movement of my clarinet-cello-piano trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” with y''all I received a flurry of responses.  \r\n\r\nMany of you were intrigued with the idea of trees conversing.  Several of the musicians among you kindly requested that I send PDFs of the full score and parts and mp3s of all five movements, which I am very glad to do for anyone who is interested, and for free.  My gift.\r\n\r\nIt is my policy nowadays to give away my life’s work to the greatest extent possible.\r\n\r\nIn selecting music to share in these weekly emails, I usually bounce around among my works, varying the offerings between vocal and instrumental works, light and serious works, long and short movements.  But when y’all seemed enthusiastic about the first movement of “Conversation of the Trees,” I decided to share the remaining four movements over the following six or seven weeks.\r\n\r\nToday I want to share the Finale of “Conversation of the Trees."\r\n\r\nThe Finale aspires to convey the perky parlance of slender trees, to wit, birches,  poplars and the like.  The music strikes me as being simultaneously Bach-ish and American-sounding, another of the quirky confluences that are everywhere in this work.  \r\n\r\nThese trees are smiling as they converse and I hope that you will be smiling, too, as you listen.\r\n\r\nTo hear Trio da Camera (clarinetist Laurel Bennett, cellist Teresa Villani and pianist Carol Alexander) performing the fifth movement of Trio #4, “Conversation of the Trees,” click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),75);

The task is repetitive; pickets are identical.  Yet the undertaking was exciting and satisfying; the fence delineated our tiny estate, rendering it charmingly, cheerily old-fashioned.  \r\n\r\nLike our picket fence, this music takes its shape from the repetition of a very simple motive:  up a half step, down a half step, nothing more.  A musical triangle, like the top end of a picket. \r\n\r\nThe little motif finds its way through a series of episodes, just as the our fence zig-zagged along the edges and corners of our little yard, punctuated by three gates.  \r\n\r\nThis piece was originally scored for oboe and strings but I re-scored it for violin, oboe and piano in 2010 because I felt that the piece’s quartal harmonies would sound better on the piano than they do in the strings. \r\n\r\nJust to be sure I’m not losing you here … a ‘quartal’ chord is built out of notes that are a fourth apart, i.e., four steps apart from each other on a musical scale.  Triadic chords are more usual, and are built out of thirds, i.e. notes that are three steps apart.  Strings are made to play triads and they resonate best when the music is triadic.  Pianos, contrariwise, can play any combination of notes without altering the instrument’s resonance.\r\n\r\nGrowing up as a kid who played the piano, which sounds equally good in any key, I didn’t realize that stringed instruments actually sound better in some keys than others.  That’s why so many classical string works are written in D major or A major.  String players are happiest performing music written in those keys because those keys make their instruments sound rich, bright, fulsome.\r\n\r\nI learned this trick the hard way.  When I was about 30, I wrote a piece for violin in A flat major.  In rehearsal, the violinist showed me how much better it would have sounded if I had written it a half step higher, in A major.  He played it for me in both keys and I was amazed at the difference.  \r\n\r\nWhy hadn’t anyone told me this until then?  It’s a great example of the innumerable little tricks composers pick up along the way.  All our lives, we’re learning.  \r\n\r\nTo hear Picket Fence played by oboist Amy Dennison, violinist Marion Peraza de Webb  and pianist Naoko Tanaka, click on the link above.\r\n\r\nTo see a PDF of the score, click on the link above.  \r\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),47);
