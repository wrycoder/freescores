Here is an article about my clarinet-cello-piano trios.

A Clarinetist’s Journey of the Spirit   by Joe Rosen

(printed in The Clarinet magazine, September 2007)

	“What music is this?  Chamber music with clarinet, sure, but by whom?” 

	Radio reception in the Pennsylvania mountains fades, recovers, then fades again, exasperating drivers.  Fear of missing the announcer’s tag forced me to pull over and wait for the coda.  Finally came the revelation:  Rick Sowash.  New to me.  I made note and hightailed it home to New York City.

	A Google later I learned that I had heard one of no less than fifteen trios for clarinet, cello and piano by this 57-year old Cincinnati composer.   Among my best friends are a cellist and pianist.  I thought, why not? and ordered the sheet music directly from the composer at his website.

	My cellist and pianist friends joined me twice a week, for seven weeks and played through all the trios in the order in which they were written, an extraordinary journey.  Then we played them through all over again, thrilled to find memorable tunes, rich tonal harmonies, intricate counterpoint and an astonishing variety of moods, ranging from humor to tragedy.
	
	These trios were written during the past eight years for the composer’s French friends, “les Gavottes,” a Riviera-based professional trio.  They recorded the first three on their CD “Enchantement d’avril” and have performed a half dozen of the trios, most notably at the Cannes Film Festival.  Les Gavottes have not found time to perform or even read all the music Sowash has written for them; my friends and I are the first musicians to play through all of Sowash’s trios.

	The first trio is entitled “Journey of the Spirit,” a title which might apply collectively to  these fifteen works.  Its four movements proceed from a darkly mysterious opening in A minor, through a Romantic interlude in G major, to a probing plainchant in E major, to a Hallelujah-like finale in Eb major.  It’s a journey from doubt to faith.

	Trio #2, Enchantment of April, gives a nod to the life-affirming Miramax film of a few years back entitled “Enchanted April.”  We’re in Bb and Eb major and it’s all sweetness and light.

	The zig-zag pattern of these trios is apparent in the contrasting Trio #3, Shadows of November in A minor.  The outer movements invite rough, energetic playing while the middle movement, a farewell to Autumn, is some of the saddest music we’ve ever played.

	There are some challenging licks in these trios, but virtuoso display is not what this music is about.  Solid intermediate players can easily handle most of the trios.  Expressivity is what’s required.

	Conversation of the Trees is the subtitle for #4, in D minor, offering five movements of lively ‘chatter’ between the three instruments, which are made of wood, after all, and wood comes from trees, right?  Here the trees “speak.”

	Trio #5, “in classical style,” takes up the vocabulary of Haydn-through-Schubert, but with an American twist.  The key is G minor, the minuet is tongue-in-cheek, the variations on an original American-sounding hymn-tune are colorful and funny and touching.  All of the major themes of the first three movements recur in the rollicking Finale.

	Again by sharp contrast comes the lengthy Trio #6, Goddess of the Moon, with a Debussy-like atmosphere, impressionistic and ambiguous, and cast in the gorgeous key of Db major.  The movements are entitled:  Prologue, Nocturne, Interlude, Scherzo and Epilogue.  We performed this trio in concert and found that audiences want to applaud after the rousing Scherzo, thinking the piece has ended.

	It’s a zig-zag again from lush, long #6 to short, snappy, funny #7 “The Philosopher Visits a Country Fair” in one movement.  In A major, this one reminded us of Bernstein’s Candide Overture.  The country fair bubbles along in changing meters while the grumpy philosopher is depicted by a noble, pompous hymn-tune in 3/4.  The two musics are then combined and get along beautifully.

	Self-portraits are usual for painters, rare among composers.  Trio #8 offer Two Self-portraits, both in Eb minor.  First “as a fool,” a clunky, hilarious four-part round with a  contrasting pastoral section in C major.  Then the deeply felt, “as a sage” with a C major middle section once again, this time with a starry-night feel.

	From self-portrayal, the composer moved to portraying “Five Women” in Trio #9 in F major.  They are the women in the composer’s life and his movement titles describe the ladies thus:  Merry & Mystical, In the Process of Becoming, Mother of My Children, Beautiful & Sad, and The Vitality of Emilie.  This is the trio with the greatest variety of styles.

	The next two trios are lighter and easier.  “Winds of May” is #10 in Bb major, with movements entitled Morning, Deep Forest, Wildflowers and Sunset.  #11 in G major is a nostalgic remembrance of good times, entitled “We Sang, We Danced.”   The last movement is a very funny Tango, the only one in all the trios.

	The longest and most challenging trio is #12 in Eb major, “Voyageurs,” an epic homage to Canada.  The first movement, “Geese in Flight,” captures the V-formation flight pattern of Canada geese with a figure that rises in the clarinet while falling simultaneously in the cello.  “Song of the Voyageurs” evokes the hardiness of the French trappers with what sounds like a Breton folksong.  Canada’s natural wonders are depicted in the last two movements:  “Starshadows on Snow” and “A Majestic Land.”  This music has a Sibelius-like orchestral breadth and ambition.

	Thirteen is famously the unlucky number.  Trio #13 in Eb minor, though a joy to play, is alternately sad and furious.  The two movements, Passacaglia and Fugue, are played with hardly a pause between them, since the fugue subject grows right out of the Passacaglia tune.  Indeed, at the height of the fugue, the Passacaglia tune recurs in the bass while the couterpoint rages overhead.  This trio is boldly ‘dedicated to the victims of Bush and Bin Laden,’ a mournful, angry response to current events.

	There are two un-numbered trios, both chamber transcriptions of orchestral works.  “The View from Carew,” originally a rhapsody in Eb major for clarinet and orchestra, evokes the sublime view of the Ohio Valley that is to be seen atop Carew Tower, the tallest building in Cincinnati.  

	The other and most recent trio is a transcription of the composer’s new Concerto for Cello and Strings with Clarinet, written in the Fall of ‘06.  It’s a cello concerto alright, but the clarinet seems unwilling to accept this and constantly tries to upstage the soloist.  As in trio #7, the key is A major and the score calls for the A clarinet.  After the dark anger of #13 and the deep sighs of “Carew” the mood finally turns joyful again in this final trio.  The four movements are:  Hymns & Fugues, Bulgarian Blues, Sorbet (a 28-second bagatelle) and the improbable Finale, written in the Reggae/Dixieland style known as ‘Ska.’

	I’ll admit to being a little obsessed with this composer but the rewards of playing his music are very great.  Part of the fun, for me, was that, when I started playing his music, almost no one seemed to have heard of him.  That’s changing.  Kalin Ivanov premiered his cello concerto in Carnegie Hall in April, ‘07.  Rick met Kalin in my apartment while attending a home concert of his music which I had organized.

	In discovering these trios and the many other Sowash clarinet works (36 in all) we’ve also made a friend.  Rick has attended and emceed performances we’ve done in Manhattan, Long Island, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Waterloo, Ontario.  He’s even written two works specifically for me:  Three Bagatelles for Clarinet & Bassoon and “Audubon,” his only wind octet.

	It’s been a Journey of the Spirit.  And it all started with a half-heard broadcast in the mountains of Pennsylvania.
