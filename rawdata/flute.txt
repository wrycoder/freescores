Flute Music by Rick Sowash

Simply by asking, any flutist can receive free PDFs of the full score-and-parts for any or all of my flute works as well as mp3 recordings.   

All a flutist has to do is email me at:  rick@sowash.com.

It’s my policy to give away my music to anyone who is interested in discovering it.  Also, no permission is required to print the PDFs or perform the music.  

None of these works are for sale.  My music is my gift to musicians and their audiences.   The ideas came to me for free; I am very happy to pass along my music for free.

Ask for a bunch of pieces!  You’re not being greedy.  You’re being curious!  That’s a good thing!

My scores and parts are professional in appearance, carefully rendered in the computer notation program Finale.  Page-turns are calculated for ease and convenience.  

Thank you in advance for allowing me to share my work with you.
